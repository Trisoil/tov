260055,270060:'I wonder if the same thing's \nhappening in Deidon Hold and \nHalure. I hope they're all right...'
260056:'It looks like the weirdness in the \nsky cleared up, but some houses in \nthe lower quarter were damaged.<PAGE>The Knights won't do anything \nfor us, so I guess we'll take \ncare of things ourselves.'
260057,270062:'All we have to do with the \ndebris is clear it away, but the \nmain problem is the buildings. <PAGE>We just don't have enough \nable-bodied folk to work. If only \nthe evacuees would return...'
260058:'With the barriers down the \nmonsters can get in, but are \nthere really that many monsters?<PAGE>Even if there are, \nI'm sure the Knights \nwill take care of them.'

260060,270065:'There was a rumbling from \nthe north, like an earthquake. \nWhat could that have been?'

260078,270083:'The fountain blastia is \nbroken... At this rate even \nthe houses will be flooded!<PAGE>We have to stop the flow first. \nWe'll think about pumping out \nthe excess water later.'
260079,270084:'<STR>(YUR), don't just \nstand there! \nYou help out too!'
260080,270085:'Well well, <STR>(YUR), the \nKnights certainly are \nfond of you.<PAGE>Leblanc and his troupe \nwere just running around \ncalling your name.'
260081,270086:'Be careful you don't do \nsomething to get <STR>(FRE)\nchasing after you, too!'
260082:'Hey, didn't you leave \nthe city because the \nKnights were chasing you? <PAGE>What, did you forget something?'
260083:'It'd be best if you \ndidn't come back. \nYou never know. <PAGE>Somebody could tell the \nKnights about you.'

260085,270088:'Don't worry, <STR>(YUR). <PAGE>Turning you in for \na reward wouldn't make \nme very happy.'
260086:'Looks like the false \ncharges got dropped.<PAGE>I always believed in you, <STR>(YUR).<PAGE>Really! I did!'
260087:'Do what's right, even if the \nKnights are chasing you. \nThat's you, <STR>(YUR).'
260088:'The fountain blastia's been fixed!♪ \nIt's all thanks to <STR>(FRE)\ngetting the core back.∀<PAGE><STR>(FRE)'s so popular. \nI hear there's even a \n<STR>(FRE) Defense Force.'
260089:'The <STR>(FRE) Defense \nForce is really just \na fan club. <PAGE>It sounded like fun, \nso I joined too!♪'
260090:'To think the aque blastia \nhad just been repaired! \nThey must've done a shoddy job. <PAGE>I even used money I'd\nsaved for my wedding \nto get it fixed...'
260091,270092:'Well, whining isn't going to stop \nall this water. We have to do \nsomething about the fountain. <PAGE>I'd never forgive \nmyself if I let my \ngirl drown.'
260092,270093:'Well, the water stopped, but \nnow we can't use the fountain. \nSooner or later the water will run out. <PAGE>We better start \nthinking about other \nways to get water.'
260093,270094:'I used the money I got \nback from the shoddy repair to \nfind new sources of water.<PAGE>My wedding? Nah, we just put it \noff for a little. She'll wait for me. \nBut thanks, <STR>(YUR).'
260094,270095:'The lower quarter's the same \nas always. The fountain \nblastia is still broken.<PAGE>There's no point in getting \nworked up about it. \nWe'll fix it in good time.'
260095:'That blastia breaking was bad, \nbut it brought the people of \nthe lower quarter together.<PAGE>Even my girl says \nshe's counting on me... \nHeh heh.'
260096:'Wow, <STR>(FRE)'s amazing! \nYou hear he made captain?<PAGE>It's thanks to him our fountain's \nback in shape, too. He's the \npride of the lower quarter.'
260097,270098:'<STR>(FRE)'s promotion to \ncaptain makes me as \nhappy as if it were myself.'
260098,270099:'What's that thing \nin the sky that looks \nlike an aurora? <PAGE>Ever since it appeared, the \nsky's been so strange...'
260099:'What, now the barrier blastia's \nbroken? At least the monsters \nhaven't invaded yet.<PAGE>We have to protect this \ncity. The lower quarter \nis my only home.'
260100,270101:'This is like the \ndevastation after a \ngiant storm, or something. <PAGE>When things are this bad, \neven getting depressed \nabout it feels stupid.'
260101,270102:'No point in getting all weepy. \nWe've got to work \ntogether and rebuild.<PAGE>If we can get the lower quarter\nback in shape, maybe everyone \nwho left will come back.'
260102,270103:'The refugees started coming \nback after things got back \nto normal in Zaphias.<PAGE>Of course, that was right when \nthe monsters showed up and the \nbarrier broke... What a life!'
260103,270104:'What's become of \nour Zaphias?'
260104,270105:'<STR>(FRE) took everyone \nto a town with a new barrier. <PAGE>What are you going \nto do, <STR>(YUR)?'
260105,270106:'They have a barrier, so it's \nsafer there. But I don't want \nto leave the lower quarter.<PAGE>I'm going to stay in the \nlower quarter to the bitter end.'
260106,270107:'All water for the lower quarter\ncame through that aque blastia... \nNow the pumps in our homes are dry.<PAGE>I don't really understand it, \nbut my husband says the broken \nfountain is the reason.'
260107:'I'm worried about water in the \nlower quarter. We can't cook, \nwash clothes, take baths... <PAGE>I don't want to \nshower with the \ndirty river water.'
260108,270109:'Welcome back, <STR>(YUR). \nLooks like you've caused \na ruckus again.<PAGE>They're watching you, \n<STR>(YUR), so don't do anything \ncrazy, okay?'
260109:'What are you going to do now? \n<STR>(FRE)'s doing his duty as a \nknight, but you...'
260110,270111:'If it isn't <STR>(YUR) and \nthe young lady.<PAGE>So you came back \nto Zaphias.'
260111,270112:'Don't even think \nabout going uptown.<PAGE>The Knights are still looking \nfor you all, <STR>(YUR).'
260112:'They say <STR>(FRE)'s doing a great \njob with the Knights. It's all \nthe lower quarter can talk about.<PAGE>He brought back the fountain's core, \ntoo. They can't praise <STR>(FRE)\nenough, as far as I'm concerned.'
260113:'You never change, do you \n<STR>(YUR)? Always letting \n<STR>(FRE) take the lead.<PAGE>I hope you'll show us what \nyou're really made of one of \nthese days, <STR>(YUR).'
260114,270115:'I sold the comb my late \nhusband gave me to help raise \nmoney to fix the blastia. <PAGE>It was the first gift \nhe ever gave me...'
260115,270116:'Will the house I spent so \nmany years together with \nmy husband in sink...? <PAGE>Why did I \neven bother...?'
260116,270117:'Thank you so much, <STR>(YUR). \nI think I'll be able to buy back \nthe comb my husband gave me. <PAGE>You seem to have some \ntrouble with the Knights... \nIs everything all right?'
260117,270118:'The aque blastia \nnever got fixed, did it?<PAGE>What if the barrier \nblastia broke, too? \nThat's a scary thought.'
260118,270119:'Is it safe for you to come \nback here, <STR>(YUR)? <PAGE>The Knights are all worked \nup looking for you.'
260119,270120:'Stay away from the \ncastle, you hear? \nThe Knights are on alert.'
260120,270121:'These are the \npeople you're \ntraveling with...? <PAGE>Isn't it a little dangerous \ntromping around with \ngirls and children?'
260121,270122:'You be careful now.<PAGE>Leave the dangerous \nthings to the Knights. \nDon't do anything crazy.'
260122,270123:'I knew you'd come! \n<STR>(YUR), it had to be you!<PAGE>What are you gonna do? \nWhat should I do to help?'
260123,270124:'<STR>(FRE) would always be here \nin no time when stuff like \nthis happened. Why not now?<PAGE><STR>(FRE) shouldn't live in \nthe castle when he could just \ncommute from the lower quarter.'
260124,270125:'So, <STR>(YUR), you went and \ngot yourself arrested, huh? Idiot! \nI guess that's like you, though.<PAGE>I went to the royal quarter\nsince you never came back. All \nthe nobles were talking about you.'
260125:'You were in the castle, right? \nDid you see <STR>(FRE)?<PAGE>Tell <STR>(FRE) the \nlower quarter's \nin trouble!'
260126:'Hey, you're back already? \nYou don't have to run \naway any more? <PAGE>What? You're leaving again? \nMake up your mind...'
260127:'It's kind of \nlonely without \nyou around, <STR>(YUR)...<PAGE>Uhh... Nevermind...'
260128:'<STR>(YUR)! I saw \nyour wanted poster.<PAGE>I can't believe there's \na bounty on you! You're \nfamous in the Empire!'
260129,270128:'But, it's <STR>(FRE)'s job to \nhunt down people with \nbounties on their heads, right? <PAGE>I sure don't want \nyou two to fight...'
260130:'<STR>(FRE)'s a captain now! He got \nthe core back for the lower quarter\nand everything! He's amazing!<PAGE>And I know <STR>(FRE) will keep \nworking for the lower quarter, \neven as a captain.'
260131,270130:'Did you hear about the \n<STR>(FRE) Defense Force? <PAGE>They made me tell \nthem everything I know \nabout <STR>(FRE).'
260132,270131:'Ugh... \nI feel awful...'
260133,270132:'Ever since the sky went all \nfunny, something's just...not \nright. This is horrible...'
260134:'It was terrible when I got \nback to the lower quarter!<PAGE>Grass like tree trunks covered \nthe entire lower quarter... \nI couldn't believe it.'
260135:'I wonder if <STR>(FRE) will rebuild \nthings if we ask. I mean, \n<STR>(FRE)'s really important now!<PAGE><STR>(YUR), go and ask \n<STR>(FRE) for us!'
260136,270135:'<STR>(YUR), you're safe!<PAGE>Your friend said things were \nbad, so I was really worried.'
260137,270136:'No way you'd go down \nthat easy, right, <STR>(YUR)?'
260138,270137:'<STR>(FRE) built a new \ntown in Hypionia! \nIsn't that amazing?!<PAGE><STR>(FRE)... He's on \nanother level, seriously.'
260139:'All the members of the \n<STR>(FRE) Defense Force followed \n<STR>(FRE) to his new town.<PAGE>They just don't get it! \n<STR>(FRE) would really remain \nhere in the lower quarter.'
260140,270139:'The aque blastia broke, huh?<PAGE>No surprise there. They only \nlet us have old beat-up blastia \nhere in the lower quarter.'
260141,270140:'If you've got a problem \nwith it, go tell the imperial \nfamily or the Council. <PAGE>They're the ones who \ndecide what we get.'
260142,270141:'You see that, beyond those buildings? \nThat's our barrier blastia, the Sword Stair. \nIt protects Zaphias from monsters.<PAGE>The barrier is incredibly important... \nOur lives and livelihood depend on it.'
260143,270142:'Almost all the towns in the \nEmpire have a barrier blastia, \nnot just here in Zaphias.<PAGE>Places without them have \nto fortify and arm themselves \nto keep the monsters out.'
260144,274961:'The knights will find a reason to \narrest anyone they don't like, \neven if you haven't done anything.<PAGE>It's not a good time to \ncome back here, <STR>(YUR).'
260145,274962:'I don't even \ntrust <STR>(FRE).<PAGE>They keep an eye on the \nlower quarter too. You \nshouldn't stick around.'
260146,270143:'The Empire has a monopoly on \nthe various blastia in Zaphias, \nincluding the barrier blastia.'
260147,270144:'Historically speaking, the \nemperors never had the authority \nto control access to blastia.<PAGE>The imperial family \ndoesn't know their place. \nFools, all of them.'
260148:'After the to-do with Magistrate \nRagou, the Council's reputation \nhas taken a huge hit.<PAGE>Now the balance between the Council \nand the Imperial Knights is wavering... \nWhat will become of our Empire?'
260149,270146:'There's no question the Empire\nis in a state of disarray. <PAGE>The imperial family \nno longer has the \npower to quell this chaos.'
260150,270147:'Hey, <STR>(YUR). \nYou come looking \nfor something? <PAGE>Anything you need for work should \nbe lying around here somewhere. \nTake whatever you need.'
260151:'Onions, carrots, and...\nIs this crate booze bottles? <PAGE>Lucky I noticed, I was just about \nto kick this thing away and \nshatter them all. That was close!'
260152,270149:'So you're back, <STR>(YUR)? \nUp to your old tricks, I hear.'
260153,270150:'So who's the \nyoung lady? <PAGE>The poor thing. \nThis nasty place is \nnowhere to bring a girl.'
260154,270151:'Hey, welcome back! \nNice to see you're \nstill alive.'
260155:'You should visit \nyour old room \nonce in a while, <STR>(YUR). <PAGE>If you don't take care \nof it, the dust in there \nwill start forming strata!'

260225,270213:'Isn't closing off the entire \ncity a little excessive? \nIt's such a bother for us citizens.'
260226:'They still haven't caught the thief. \nThey put up pictures of the guy, \nbut they're terrible.<PAGE>Hey...\nYou kinda look like him...'
260227:'Even a picture as bad as \nthat can capture a person's \nspecial features.'
260228:'The pictures of the thief \nfrom the royal quarter\nwere finally taken down. <PAGE>I guess they finally caught him.'

260234,270218:'Everyone in the city is so kind.<PAGE>I visit the lower quarter sometimes, \ntoo. It's so lively, and the \npeople are so nice. It's great!'
260235,270219:'If there's ever anything \nI can do to help you, \nplease let me know.'
260236:'I think it's good that \nthe Empire manages \nthe blastia.<PAGE>People tend to forget that \nblastia are managed because they're \nsuch a part of everyday life.'
260237:'There must be some reason \nfor blastia to be managed. <PAGE>I don't know what it is, but...'
260238,270222:'Do you know the saying, \n"To lack nobility is \nto lack humanity"?<PAGE>Ah, but of course you wouldn't. \nYou lot have no education, \nafter all. Forgive me.'
260239,270223:'The lower caste continues \nto work fussily about today, \nI see. How miserable.'
260240,270224:'They say some commoners \nbroke into one of the \nnoble mansions. <PAGE>Isn't that just like \nthe poor? They lack \nconscience and dignity!'
260241,270225:'The pauper filth should be \nhappy to polish our boots. <PAGE>Not that I'd let a wretch \nlike you anywhere near \nmy boots, of course.'
260242,270226:'Ever busy, ever \nbare, they say. <PAGE>How fitting.'

260244,270228:'The Empire may appear \npeaceful, but its foundations \nare shaking. <PAGE>We still don't have \na new emperor.'
260245,270229:'It's already been six months \nsince Krunos XIV passed on... <PAGE>There aren't even any hints \nas to who the next emperor \nmight be. It is most unusual.'
260246,270230:'Apparently the \naspirants for emperor \nare quite young. <PAGE>Even if it's too early to ascend \nto the throne, they could at least \nlet us know who the successor is.'
260247,270231:'I'm so worried with no \nsuccessor named yet... <PAGE>Who's going to take \ncommand if there were \na state of emergency?'
260248,270232:'There are rumors the Council \nand Imperial Knights are clashing \nover the new emperor. <PAGE>It seems they both have \nan aspirant they favor to \ntake over the throne.'
260249,270233:'The power balance between the \nCouncil and the Knights could change \ndepending on the next emperor. <PAGE>I just hope whoever ascends \nto the throne truly cares \nfor their subjects...'
260250,270234:'The barrier is...whirling around? \nWait, is that even the barrier? \nI've never seen such a strange sky.'
260251,270235:'Many people have \nleft Zaphias.<PAGE>But I've lived in this city \nso long, I'd never be \nable to just abandon it.'
260252,270236:'Dragons and phoenixes were \nflying over Zaphias... \nWhat were they doing? <PAGE>I was sure they'd come to \nattack us, but it seems \nthe barrier blocked them.'
260253,270237:'It looks like the \nbarrier has stabilized. \nThank heavens.'
260254,270238:'What is that in the sky...?'
260255,270239:'Was the problem with \nthe barrier an omen that the \nsky would become so strange?'
260256,270240:'Thanks to the efforts of \nthe Knights, the capital\nwon't be attacked by monsters.<PAGE>Everyone who ran away \nacted much too rashly.'
260257,270241:'Putting aside the matter of \nthat incident with the Commandant, \nwe need the Knights. <PAGE>That state of Zaphias right \nnow is proof of that.'
260258,270242:'What's wrong, son? Are you lost? \nZaphias is a huge city, after all. \nVisitors get lost all the time.<PAGE>The capital is \ndivided into \nthree areas.'
260259,270243:'This is the citizen quarter. To the \nsouth is the lower quarter, and up the \nstairs to the west is the royal quarter.<PAGE>The castle is north. You can get \nthere from the royal quarter. \nYou'll know it by the huge gate.'
260260:'Hey! You're the thief! <PAGE>I saw you getting chased!'
260261:'Th-there's no way you're \nstealing from me! \nI-I don't have anything...'

260263,270245:'Eeeyaaaah! \nD-don't kill me! \nYou can have all my money...'
260264:'Whoa! \nHey, you're the kidnapper!\nDon't take me!'
260265:'H-how could you be \ni-i-innocent when you \nkidnapped the princess?!'
260266,270246:'As long as we remain in \nZaphias there's nothing \nto fear from the monsters. <PAGE>We've got our barrier, \nand of course the Knights.'
260267,270247:'Zaphias is the safest \ncity in the world.'
260268,270248:'You see \nall the tents \nover there? <PAGE>They're the tents for \nthe morning market.'
260269,270249:'There are all \nkinds of vegetables \nand meats for sale. <PAGE>My mommy and daddy \nsell bread there too!'

260271,270251:'Everyone's says I'm \nlike the poster girl \nfor the market. <PAGE>What's a poster girl?'
260272,270252:'Welcome! \nYummy fresh-baked \nbread for sale!! <PAGE>Oh, sorry, I was just \npracticing. I don't actually \nhave any bread to sell.'
260273,270253:'Mommy and Daddy's \nbread is really tasty. \nCome and try it sometime!'
260274,270254:'I came to Zaphias\nhoping I could help \npeople, but... <PAGE>Now that I'm here, I don't \nreally know what to do.'
260275,270255:'I'm trying to find \nsomething I can help with. <PAGE>I suppose I'll have to \nmeet more people in \nthe capital first.'
260276,275044:'Hey you were running around \nwith some guys in armor earlier! <PAGE>That looked like fun! \nWhat kind of game was it?'
260277,275045:'I wanna play that \nchase game too!'
260278:'Hey! You're that \nwanted guy!<PAGE>I would help keep the \ncapital safe if I caught \na wanted man...<PAGE>For now, I need to \nstart with meeting more \npeople in the capital. <PAGE>Now I know the lower quarter\nand the people who live here.'
260279,275047:'You look kind of like \nthat guy on the wanted \nposters, but...not... <PAGE>It'd be bad if they were \nreally false charges. <PAGE>People talk, you know, \nand it's good information \na lot of the time. <PAGE>It's a good idea to \nlisten to what people \nlike me have to say.'
260280,270258:'Zaphias may be a nice place \nto live, but that means its \ntaxes are that much higher. <PAGE>Prices went up again recently...'

260282,270260:'Something's wrong \nwith the barrier...<PAGE>No, wait. Is this...aer?'
260283,270261:'Why would so much aer suddenly \nbe flowing through Zaphias?<PAGE>It seems to be coming from \nthe castle... Could the source \nbe the barrier blastia...?'
260284,270262:'The city's still in chaos, and now \nof all times the knight guarding the \nramparts has to be that guy...'
260285:'The knight usually guarding \nthe lower quarter is a \ndependable, loyal person. <PAGE>He's in the Schwann Brigade. \nThe useless ones are in the Cumore Brigade. \nThe commanders make the difference.'
260286,270264:'I'm helping the Knights \nfight the monsters. <PAGE>I did the same \njob in Halure, so I'm \nsure I'm some help.'
260287:'I borrowed a bodhi blastia from \na knight. I know the Council didn't \napprove it, but hey...<PAGE>I know it's against the rules and all, \nbut there are way more serious \nthings to worry about now.'
260288,270266:'Apparently the Knights \nprotecting the capital now \nare all pretty diligent guys. <PAGE>The worthless ones all \nran away a long time ago.'
260289,270267:'What kind of leadership did \nthe Knights have, anyway?<PAGE>With Commandant Alexei and all... \nI don't know what to think of \nthe Imperial Knights anymore.'

260294,270270:'Hey! \nI saw your face \non a poster! <PAGE>If I brought you to the \nKnights they'd give me a \nlot of Gald, wouldn't they?'
260295,270271:'I'm gonna haul you \nin and have the \nKnights hire me!'
260296,270272:'Did you hear? The Knights \nhave a new brigade: \nthe <STR>(FRE) Brigade!'
260297:'I met <STR>(FRE) before he \nwas a captain, you know. \nHe's a really nice guy! <PAGE>When I join the Knights \nI'm gonna be in the \n<STR>(FRE) Brigade!'

260300,270276:'Is it true the aque blastia \nin the lower quarter\nbroke? How terrible.'
260301,270277:'If you need water, \nbring some from \nthe citizen quarter.<PAGE>In troubled times we all \nhave to help each other out.'
260302,275062:'Oh my! You're \nthe one the Knights \nwere chasing! <PAGE>Do you really think it's \na good idea to be here?'
260303:'Only nobles and \nroyalty should be \non this level.<PAGE>This isn't a place for \npeople from the \nlower quarter like you.'
260304:'But you know, I was \nactually raised in the \nlower quarter, too.<PAGE>Being up here really \nmakes me miss the warmth \nof the lower quarter...'
260305:'One of the guards over there \ntook a rock to the head \nand got knocked out. <PAGE>How pathetic...'
260306:'You know, this armor is \nactually really thin. <PAGE>I really wish they'd \nsupply us with some \nheavier armor.'
260307:'The royal quarter stretches \nall the way past this gate, \nalong the outside of the castle.<PAGE>They don't really like ordinary, \nworking people over there.'
260308:'Maybe it's the whole thief thing, \nbut people stare at you just for \nbeing from the lower quarter.'
260309,270310:'It's almost overwhelming \nhow large the castle is \nwhen you're this close.'
260310:'Our barrier blastia\n"The Sword Stair" is pretty huge too. \nIt kind of numbs your senses.'
260311,260313,270312,270314:'Ahead is \nZaphias Castle.'

260326:'One should choose their \npets very carefully. <PAGE>You can tell someone's \nstatus by what type of \npet they have, you know.'

260346:'Judging by the direction, \nthe mountain that fell must \nhave been near Aspio.'

260348:'You don't think \nyou can draw \nwater here, do you?<PAGE>You commoners are \nso rude and greedy. Go \nback from where you came.'
260350:'You're not the bandit \nwho broke into the \nmansion, are you? <PAGE>We assume commoners in the \nroyal quarter are thieves. \nIf you don't like it, don't come.'
260352:'Don't walk around here \nin such shabby clothes!<PAGE>You ruin the grace of this city! \nReturn to the lower areas at once!'
260354:'You think you're going \nto wash your dog now?<PAGE>How dare you bring that filthy animal \nhere! What's a commoner like you doing \nwith your own dog, anyway? Such audacity!'
260355:'Have you heard? They say unusual \nnoises are coming from one of \nthe empty mansions lately. <PAGE>I'd like to report it to \nthe Knights, but as it's \nnothing more than a rumor...'
260356:'I imagine one of those \nlowly commoners has broken \nin to steal something. <PAGE>This is no place for low \nfolk to dawdle. Do you \nunderstand what I'm saying?'
260357:'The wretched thief that \nbroke into that manor \nhas been caught!<PAGE>Well, I would like to \nthink I did my part to \nkeep the capital safe.'
260358:'I saw the scoundrel break \ninto the mansion and \nreported it to the Knights. <PAGE>Captain Cumore took \ncare of him.'
260359:'Once I informed the Knights, \nthey were kind enough to \npay me a small reward. <PAGE>Not that I can buy \nmuch of value with \n100,000 Gald.'
260360:'Oh! Someone will inform \nthe Knights if you loiter \nhere much longer.'
260361:'The mansion near the lake? \nEveryone's talking about it. <PAGE>The house is supposed to be \nempty, but people have seen \nlights shining at night.'
260362:'Perhaps someone \nbought it? <PAGE>The mansion is quite spacious... \nAnother of the nobles \nmight be moving in.'

260364:'...But you know \n...You look...<PAGE>No... He must be in the \ncastle dungeons now. \nYou couldn't...'
260365:'That mansion has been \nquiet ever since that \nbusiness with the thief. <PAGE>I wonder what that light \nin the window was...'
260366:'I wonder if a thief has \ntaken up residence there...'
260367:'After the thief was caught \nthose noises stopped \ncoming from the mansion. <PAGE>People have stopped talking \nabout it, too. I suppose it \nreally was empty all along.'
260368:'Even so, they say \nthe thief escaped. \nHow frightening...'
260369,260371,260373,260375:'Oh no... You came \nall the way here? \nOh well...'
260370:'You came for \nwater, right? <PAGE>Now hurry up and \ngo back to wherever \nyou came from.'
260372:'Do you plan to sneak \ninto the mansion like \nthat thief earlier? <PAGE>I swear, turn over any \nrock and out crawls \na filthy thief.'
260374:'You should be happy \nif you could live in that mansion.<PAGE>There's nothing \nin it now though...'
260376:'You want money \nthis badly? \nMoney grubber.'
260377:'I'm soooo in love with \nCaptain Cumore of the \nImperial Knights!∀<PAGE>I wish he was my boyfriend. \nHe looks so hot when he's \ncrushing those commoners!'

260380:'That's my dear \nCumore!<PAGE>He's my first choice \nfor a boyfriend.☆'
260381:'Commandant Alexei of \nthe Imperial Knights \ncame here a while back.<PAGE>He is soooo hot!'
260382:'The Commandant was with a blonde \nkid he called "Your Highness". \nI don't remember much about him. <PAGE>I don't have time for scrawny little \nmama's boys!☆'
260383:'Everyone's going on \nabout the weather, but \nit's not that big a deal.<PAGE>The sky just changed a little. \nI'm much more interested in \nthe new captain, <STR>(FRE).♪'

260385:'I grit my teeth and \njoined the <STR>(FRE)\nDefense Force. <PAGE>The lower girls may not be \nvery refined, but they're nice. \nNot so bad, actually.'
260386:'Everything just went, like, \nso bad after I joined the \nDefense Force.<PAGE>I wonder where \neveryone went?'
260387:'The royal quarter\nhas many blastia.<PAGE>It seems like most \nnobles don't really care \nabout blastia.'
260388:'They seem to think \nthey can just buy \na new one if it breaks.'
260389:'It seems like that \nmansion was being \nused for something. <PAGE>I heard a young man found out \nand snuck in, but then he \nwas captured by the Knights.'
260390:'Maybe I should have followed \nup with the Knights and \ncleared him of the charges...'
260391:'No one really knows \nthe value of blastia.<PAGE>I think we need to let \nmore people know just \nhow important they are.'
260392:'It would be nice \nif we could actually create \nblastia by ourselves again.'
260393:'Blastia provide invaluable \nbenefits to the quality \nof peoples' lives.<PAGE>I intend to help the humans \nso that they may utilize blastia \neven more effectively.'
260394:'Tools exist \nto be used.<PAGE>Don't you feel pity for all the \nblastia buried beneath the \nearth, completely forgotten?'
260395:'There was nothing \nI could do.'
260396:'I came to the capital to atone \nfor the sins of the race that \nbrought blastia unto this world. <PAGE>I was so certain \nthat blastia was \nbeing used safely...'
260397:'The disturbance in \nthe aer seems to \nhave quieted, but...<PAGE>Have we truly \nescaped danger...?'
260398:'If the legends of \nthe Kritya are true...'
260399:'What is that...? \nIt's vile...'
260400:'Part of the monster in the sky \nfell to the ground somewhere. <PAGE>It was huge... If there were \na town under it, it would \nsurely have been crushed.'

260402:'What could that tower be? <PAGE>I've never heard \nof such a thing.'
260403,264745,275368,275372:'You there! \nThis exit is for \nnobles only.<PAGE>Common rabble like you \nshould use the exit \nin the lower quarter.'
260404,275369:'No no no. I don't care if you're \ndesperate. Try again when you \nare of the proper status. <PAGE>You would have no problem \nif you were, say, the Commandant \nof the Knights. Hah hah hah!'
260405,275370:'Were you the commoners \narrested recently for breaking \ninto that empty mansion?<PAGE>I won't let you get away. \nNo no no.'
260406,275371:'This exit is for nobles \nonly. Well, carriages and \nwhatnot as well. <PAGE>I'm sorry, but you \ncommoners cannot pass.'
260407,260411,270412,270416:'It may not be much, \nbut I managed to escape \nwith my products.'

260538:'Ohhh... \nWhy am I so \ndepressed...?'
260539,260677:'Hmm... There must be some \nway to bring the Tree of \nHalure back to life...'
260540,260678:'I don't have the \nknowledge to look \ninto what caused it.'
260541:'It's the season for flower \nviewing, but there aren't \nany flowers to view. <PAGE>And monsters are attacking...\nIt's too much...'
260542:'Flower viewing \nis the least of \nour problems...'
260543,260701,270548,270653:'I can't believe monsters \nattacked... Why isn't the \nbarrier blastia working?!'
260544,260702:'I don't want to be eaten!'

260575,260577:'You there! Travellers! Do you \nhappen to know a good mage who \ncould fix a barrier blastia?'
260578:'The Tree of Halure used \nto protect our town.'
260579:'Is this town finished?'
260580:'Now Halure is safe, too.'
260581:'As the Tree protects us, \nwe shall protect the Tree.'
260582:'What are Imperial Knights \ndoing in Halure...?'
260583:'I fear they might do something \nto damage the Tree.'

260587:'We can decide \nour own destiny.<PAGE>If we can keep the \nTree of Halure safe...'
260588,270588:'The Empire and the Knights \nalways make fun of us. <PAGE>I guess the Knights and \nthe government are not \nfriends of the people.'
260589,270589:'Good Knights, bad Knights... \nCan we trust the \nKnights, can we not...? <PAGE>The only thing \nthat's clear is that \nthe top guy is bad.'
260590,270601:'The current situation may \nnot be favorable... but we \nmust stop lamenting the past.'

260592,270603:'The disaster was unfortunate. \nAs long as we still live, \nhowever, there is hope.'
260593,270604:'I'm going to do my \nbest to bring the \nsurvivors happiness.'
260594:'Sometimes living can \nme more difficult than \nsurrendering to death.'

260609:'This is a tranquil \ntown, famous for our \nbeautiful flowers.'
260610,270613:'This is the City of Blossoms, \nHalure. We have many refugees \nfrom the capital now.'
260611,270614:'This is Halure. \nPlease feel free to relax \nand get some rest. <PAGE>...But I know that's hard \nwith so many people.'
260612:'Nothing blooms forever \nin this world. <PAGE>All that breathes \nwill someday stop.'
260613:'That was just about \nour last moment alive. \nThat was it.'
260614:'A miracle. I don't \nknow who said it, \nbut it's beautiful. <PAGE>But we have to remember \nthat miracles don't \nhappen twice.'
260615:'A miracle that happens \noften isn't a miracle.'
260616,270619:'If beautiful flowers should give \nyou pleasure, show your gratitude \nto the roots that birthed them...'
260617,270620:'It's an old saying \nwe have in Halure.'
260618,270621:'The Tree of Halure\nmay be massive, but even \nit began as a sprout.'
260619,270622:'You could say it was watered by the \nblood, sweat and tears of the people \nthat have always tended to it.'
260620:'I think this will \nbring down the glory \nof the capital... <PAGE>Pride goes before \nthe fall...'
260621:'Even if the capital \nwas destroyed, \nit's people weren't. <PAGE>The youth must be \nstrong and live.'

260634,270624,270627,270630:'Welcome! We finally got \nsome new products! We have \na great selection of armor!'
260637:'The Tree of Halure is \nnot doing well. <PAGE>I have to get a doctor \nto examine the Tree!'
260638:'But are there doctors \nfor trees...?'
260639:'Ho! Listen! The Tree of \nHalure has come \nback to life! <PAGE>Uh... I didn't mean \nto say, "Ho." \n...Hey!'
260640:'I guess a doctor came \nto see the Tree.'
260641:'Some Knights came by. One \nof them kept saying, "I \nsay, I say" over and over.<PAGE>That's so weird...'
260642,270643:'Hey, mister, what do \nyou think they wanted?'
260643:'Fall, snow... come on, snow. <PAGE>This is what snow is like, \nright? What do you mean, \nyou don't know?! Weak...'
260644:'If these flower petals \nfell for 100 years, they would \nbury the houses. '
260645:'I didn't know there was \ntrouble in Dahngrest. \nIt seems pretty bad.'
260646,270645:'Not that it has anything \nto do with us.'
260647:'There were a lot of people \npushing and shoving. \nThey were like waves. '
260648:'Why are those \npepole from the \ncapital so arogant. <PAGE>They just happened to be \nborn there! It's just luck!'
260649:'I always felt so relieved and \nat peace when I looked around \nat this city's flowers. <PAGE>I can't believe this \ncould happen...'
260651,270633:'This world is full \nof suffering... <PAGE>But looking at the flowers \nin this city makes me \nglad that I'm alive. '
260652:'Oh... I'm so glad the \nTree came back to life...'
260653:'I don't like a whole lot of \ncommotion, but I hate not being \nable to just live my life in peace. <PAGE>I wonder if it was good \nor bad that the \nImperial Knights came.'
260654:'It would be nice if this world \nwould continue to be peaceful \nwithout the Imperial Knights. '
260655:'The flowers blossom beautifully. <PAGE>However, withered flower \npetals that bury the city \naren't necessarily beautiful. '
260656:'Even beautiful things may \nnot always be beautiful \nin their last moments. '
260657,270637:'They bloom and wither, bloom and \nwither... The flowers of Halure\nalways repeat this cycle. <PAGE>All of this is \ndue to the direct \nblessings from aer. '
260658:'Ahh, this is really \na magnificent city...'
260659,274748:'I'm worried whether those people \nwho escaped from Zaphias will \npay respect to that Tree. <PAGE>I wonder if we should \nteach everyone just how \nprecious the blossoms are.'
260660,274749:'No... \nMaybe we should just \nmind our own business?'
260661:'Although the life of the \nflower is short, it still \nblooms with all its energy. <PAGE>I really like to \nwatch these flowers. '
260662,274751:'One day I'll die, my body \nwill return to the ground, and \nflowers will bloom above me. <PAGE>I want to continue \nliving forever, giving \nenergy to the flowers.'
260663:'I may also die soon. <PAGE>Why? \nBecause my body \nfeels really weak.'
260664:'I don't have any regrets, \neven if I die tomorrow. <PAGE>Why? \nBecause I can die under \nthose beautiful flowers.'
260665:'I really like looking at the \nflowers... Having drinks while \njust gazing at the flowers...'
260666:'I wonder if those happy \ndays will come again?'
260667:'We'll be able to watch the \nblossoms again... Having drinks \nwhile watching the blossoms...'
260668:'Flower viewing, \nflower viewing!♪'
260669:'I thought the Imperial \nKnights also came to \nwatch the blossoms. <PAGE>Because they were \nloud even though they \nweren't drinking.'
260670:'Do you want to check out the \nblossoms together? We'll \nhave a good time. Trust me.'
260671:'Good drinks and \nbeautiful blossoms... <PAGE>They say, "Food over \nflowers," but you \ngotta have both.'
260672:'I'm so glad that \nI came to this city. <PAGE>My hometown in the middle of \nthe mountains looks bleak. '
260673,270649:'It's nice being able \nto relax and look \nat the flowers. '
260674:'Ohhhh, so relaxed... \nOhhhh, so drunk...'
260675,270651:'It's fun as more people gather. \nAhh... I know that we don't \nhave time to have fun. <PAGE>But I thought it \nwould be okay as it \nwas getting noisier. '
260676,270652:'It would be \nbetter if everyone \nlived here. <PAGE>Why don't you just \nhand over the capital\nto the Commandant?'
260679:'Isn't it great that \nthe Tree of Halure\nwas revived? <PAGE>But... we're worried about \nwhat we should do to ensure \nthe Tree does not die.'
260680:'The more the Tree blooms, \nthe more concerned I am. \nHmmm...'
260681:'Why did the Knights come \nto this city? Are they \nhere to collect taxes? <PAGE>I think we paid last month. \nYeah, we paid... \nWait... Did we?'
260682:'Am I going to get arrested \nif I didn't pay taxes? \nHmmmm....'
260683:'The water here is said \nto spring out from the \ntrunk of the Tree. <PAGE>Even if that was true, do you \nreally think this much water \nwould just keep coming out?'
260684:'Do you think that the \nTree will run out of \nwater and wither again?'
260685:'How did the Tree grow so big...? \nI can't sleep through the night \nwhen I ponder this question. <PAGE>There are so many \nthings to think about \nwith this town...<PAGE>Hmmmm...'
260686:'There are just too \nmany things to think \nabout in life!'
260687:'Why are there \nthis many people? <PAGE>This is a small city! \nWe can only handle so many \npeople... *Grumble*...'
260688:'About 40,000 people per square \nkilometer... Know what that is? The \npopulation density of this city. <PAGE>Normally It's about 30 people... \nSomething is way out of whack!'
260689,270546,270676:'I traveled all the way \nhere to see the flowers... \nBut the Tree has withered.'
260690,270547,270677:'This is no time for \nflower viewing, it would seem...'
260691,270678:'I traveled all the way here \nto see the flowers...\nI'm glad it wasn't a waste.'
260692,270679:'I wonder when the best \ntime for flower viewing is?'
260693,270680:'What do the Knights \nwant in Halure?'
260694,270681:'I doubt they came \nfor flower viewing!'
260695:'Why don't I get tired of \nwatching the flowers all day?'
260696:'Even if I was watching a \nbeautiful woman, I'd get \ntired of her in a single night...'
260697,270682:'The flowers bloom, then fall... \nYear after year, the same cycle.'
260698:'I suppose our lives are \nmuch the same thing...'
260699:'I want people from the capital who \nhave faced horrendous times to \nlook at the flowers and be healed. <PAGE>And then I want them \nto tell the world just \nhow good Halure is. '
260700:'No matter what's going on, looking \nat such beautiful trees makes you \nfeel like everything will be okay.'
260703,270655:'Now we'll be safe even \nif the monsters attack.'
260704:'I really, really don't \nwant to be eaten...'
260705:'Will the Knights \nprotect this town?'
260706:'If they did, our defense \ncertainly would be tough.'
260707,270659:'I can no longer see the \nmonster that used to wander \nclose to the city until recently.'
260708:'It probably gave up due \nto the blastia in this city. '
260709:'Being young and beautiful is \nnothing special, but to be old and \nbeautiful... That is true beauty.'
260710:'I wonder how old the \nTree of Halure is.'
260711:'How should we welcome \nthe refugees? <PAGE>Should we console \nthem, or just not talk \nabout the situation...?'
260712:'We don't know how to \ndeal with so many people \nfleeing at once. '
260713,270694:'The Tree of Halure may seem static, \nbut in fact it grew little by little \ninto the towering giant it is.'
260714,270695:'We are the same. \nLittle by little, day by \nday, we grow as well.'
260715:'We need a blastia engineer \nto repair the blastia... <PAGE>But there's no one \nlike that in this city.'
260716,270697:'At this rate, the town will \nbe overrun by monsters...'
260717,270667:'The blastia started working \nagain when the flowers of \nHalure returned... <PAGE>What kind of place is this...? \nThis place is really interesting.'
260718:'This is a good chance \nfor me to study blastia... '
260719:'There seems to be \na town of mages to the \neast of this town. <PAGE>I'd like to go there \nand study the blastia. '
260720:'I'd like to go to Aspio but\nstepping out of the barrier\nis dangerous. <PAGE>It's just my luck. '
260721:'I'd like to study blastia and feel \nsecure enough to repair the barrier \nblastia if it ever falls apart. <PAGE>And this feeling grows \nstronger by the day. '
260722:'I can't stop worrying \nabout when we will lose \nthe blastia again.'
260723,274760:'I've organized all the \nissues with the blastia \nin my head but... <PAGE>Argh... \nI can't think straight with \neverything going on...!'
260724,274761:'I want to escape so I \ncan think quietly again.'
260725:'Hey mister! \nStop by the historic old \nDenebola if you're tired! '
260726:'We're helping our dad. '
260727:'Come on by the \nhistoric old Denebola \ninn if you're tired.'
260728:'We get one piece of candy \nwhen we help our dad.'
260729:'The historic old \nDenebola inn is right \nabove the stairs. <PAGE>Stop by if you're tired. '
260730:'We get 100 Gald when \nwe help our dad.'
260731:'Are you tired? \nThen try the historic \nold Denebola inn. <PAGE>We'll take good \ncare of you. '
260732:'Oh... I'm tired... \nCan you all help me \nbring in some customers?'
260733:'Stop by the historic \nold Denebola inn! <PAGE>Thanks for coming. \nYou all aren't gonna \nstay at the inn today?'
260734:'The Denebola is free \nto anyone right now. '
260736,270713:'Why did it have to die...?'
260737:'If you follow the \nhill up, you'll come to \nthe Tree of Halure. <PAGE>It has been restored \nto beautiful life!'
260738,270715:'Thank you for reviving the Tree.'
260739:'If you follow the \nhill up, you'll come to \nthe Tree of Halure. <PAGE>Three types of flowers \nbloom on it...oh, do you \nalready know about them?'
260740:'How can three \ndifferent flowers bloom \non one tree...?'
260741:'The Tree of Halure is \nnot immortal. The Tree may \none day wither and die. '
260742:'We're all the same... \nIt seems a little sad \nwhen I put it that way. '
260743,274768:'I heard that Zaphias\nis in real trouble, \nbut is Halure okay? <PAGE>Did the Commandant of the Knights \ndo something? I didn't think \nhe was...evil...I guess?'
260744,274769:'I don't think that the \nCommandant of the Knights will \ninvade Zaphias... will he?'
260745:'These people escaped \nfrom Aspio after that \ntower destroyed it. <PAGE>There's a strange \nfeeling in the air...'
260746:'The people of this \ntown are all tired for \nno apparent reason. <PAGE>I don't know if I caught \ntheir bug, but I've felt \nreally tired recently...'
260747,270722:'We have lost everything...<PAGE>But we still live.'
260748,270723:'As long as we live, \nthere is hope.'
260749,270724:'Our losses are great, \nbut we will not despair.'
260750,270725:'Making new discoveries is \nour greatest happiness...'
260752:'Halure shall remain at \npeace as long as the \nflowers continue to bloom.'
260753:'Some unknown illness has hit \na lot of people recently.<PAGE>There are no visible \nsymptoms, but it seems to \nmake people tire faster... '
260754:'Sometimes, I feel \nsick to my stomach. <PAGE>At least I can still get \noutside and walk around. '
260755,274775:'This is the Krityan \ncity of Myorzo. I'm the \nguard at this gate. <PAGE>Nice to meet you.'
260756:'It's been a while since \nhumans have come to Myorzo. \nCome in, come in.'

260758,274778:'Why am I living in a place like \nthis? Well... I guess because that's \nwhat my ancestors decided...?'
260759,274779:'It's great you've come, welcome. \nCome in, come in. <PAGE>Sure I'm guarding the gate, \nbut without guests, \nI'm just bored, bored...'
260760,274780:'I'm a gatekeeper here. <PAGE>But I really don't know \nwhat I'm specifically supposed \nto do as a guard. '
260761:'I remember seeing a flying \nmonster at the elder's \nhome a long time ago. <PAGE>'

260766:'We can take them \non together. \nCharge! ♪'
260767:'Welcome to Myorzo. \nYou can't even kill time \ncoming to a place like this. '
260768:'You must be so bored to \ncome to a city like this.'
260769:'There was a large \nnoise by the entrance. <PAGE>I was so surprised. '
260770:'Oh, I was so surprised... \nDon't I look surprised? <PAGE>That's weird...'
260771:'The elder told me \nto help search for \nyour friends... <PAGE>But they're not here.'

260779,270778:'Hmm? Oh, you're the people \nthat came from outside? \nHow boring. You're so...normal.'
260780,270779:'*Sigh* \nI can't believe you people \nstill use blastia...'
260781:'That was so loud. \nJust what was \nthat noise...?'
260782:'I don't want to go \nlook, though. It's \ntoo much of a hassle. '
260783:'I heard that your friends \nstarted to disappear. <PAGE>We've been looking \nbut they don't appear \nto be in the city.'

261312,271309:'Look, it's not \nlike I'm a Barbos\nfan or anything...'
261313,271310:'S-seriously, I'm not!'
261314,271311:'With Barbos dead,\nthe Blood Alliance\nis finished...'
261315,271312:'Jobs are gonna get \nscarce without the Blood \nAlliance around anymore...'
261316,271313:'We're supposed to be friendly\nwith the Empire now? No way!'
261317:'What, are we supposed to all \nhold hands with the Knights and \nplay pattycake? What a joke!'
261320,271317:'Just being in this town makes \nme feel like I'm going to get \nwrapped up in something bad.'
261321,271318:'It might be smart to wait \nfor the right time and just \nget away from this town.'
261322:'This is bad... I was just \nhanging out, and I got \ncaught up in this mess.<PAGE>What's up with guilds\nfighting each other?!'
261323:'This is no time to \njust wander around...<PAGE>Ugh...I hate how \nlazy I am...'
261324,271319:'First Barbos, \nnow the Don?'
261325,271320:'Just think about it... \nThe heads of two of the five \nmaster guilds are dead.'
261326,271321:'What's going\nto happen now?'
261327:'What should I do?'
261328:'I don't know what to do!'
261329,265597,271324,271326,274573:'Someone do something!'
261330:'The air around this town is \nunstable, refracting the sunlight \nand turning the sky red.<PAGE>But no one knows \nwhy the air has \nbeen so unstable.'
261331:'So now this town is in \na perpetual sunset.<PAGE>It's kind of sad \nand depressing...'
261332,261333,271333,271334:'The monsters' numbers count \nfor nothing! We shall rout \nthem and drive them back!!'
261334,271335:'Those monsters... They looked \nlike the ones I fought in Keiv \nMoc... I wonder why...'
261335,271336:'......The forest ofKeiv Moc?\nIt's southwest from this town.'
261336,261337,271337,271338:'First monsters... Now \nthe Empire... \nHow pathetic...'
261338,271339:'I have no interest \nin peoples' squabbles.'
261339,271340:'The chief would say \nthe same thing. \nNo interest at all.'
261340,271341:'Ragou? \nHmph, I could care \nless about him.<PAGE>So what if a guy like \nthat falls from power? \nI don't feel a thing.'
261341,271342:'Isn't there a monster out there \nthat can move the heart \nmore than a human?'
261342:'So... What monsters should \nI go hunting next?'
261343,271344:'Hmm... Maybe I \nshould rejoin the \nchief and his men.'
261344,271345:'I gotta hurry and \ntell the chief about \nthat monster.'
261345,271346:'Monsters are evil.\nThe Hunting Blades\nexist to hunt them.'
261346,271347:'I hear the chief and \nhis men did quite a \njob in Nordopolica.'
261347,271348:'Apparently they took out \nall the monsters there.'
261348:'Whoa, whoa, whoa! The \nDon dies because of some \nwork the bosses did?<PAGE>Isn't that a little \nover-the-top?'
261349:'You could roast him, burn him, \nfry him up for breakfast... \nThe Don won't die!'
261350,271349:'I may have no interest in \npeoples' squabbles, but the \ndeath of the Don is heavy...'
261351,271350:'Maybe I'll go out hunt to \ntake my mind off things.'
261352,271351:'They say something \nhappened in Zaphias, but it \nhas nothing to do with me.'
261353,271352:'I guess I'll go fulfill the duty \nof the Hunting Blades.'
261354,271353:'The monsters are restless. \nI wonder if it's because of \nthe monster in the sky?'
261355,271354:'Sky, land, whatever. \nI'll take on all the \nvicious monsters.'
261356,271357:'I'm glad the Don can keep this \nplace lively, but I wish we'd just \ngo take out the Empire already.'
261357,271358:'Surely Barbos will \nstand against them...'
261358,271359:'What a great chance \nto show the world \nwhat a guild can do!'
261359,271360:'If we take care of this before the \nDon gets his chance to show off, \neveryone will know our strength!'
261360,271361:'Damn the Don\nand his antics!'
261361:'At this rate we could even \ntake on the Empire...'
261362,261363,271363,271364:'Now we can finally take on those \nidiots from the Empire. We'll \nshow them a thing or two.'
261364,271365:'Damn it! What do guildsmen\nthink they're doing fighting \nagainst each other?!'
261365,271366:'The Empire is the enemy!'
261366,271367:'Heh, so the mighty Don\npasses away... I won't get \nmy share of excitement.'
261367,271368:'The Don's weak. \nNow Dahngrest's \ngonna get boring.'
261368,271369:'Who the hell would \nsupport a treaty \nwith the Empire?'
261369,271370:'The Don is weak.'
261370:'If Barbos were still alive, \nhe'd take that thing down \nbefore you could blink.'
261371,271372:'What the hell does the \nDon think he's doing?'
261372,271373:'I hear Palestralle has \nmade their move.'
261373,271374:'Heh...things are going \nto get interesting.'
261374:'All right, now things \nget interesting.<PAGE>How's the Don\ngonna finish this?'
261375:'I haven't been this \nexcited in a while! \nI'm gonna enjoy this!'
261376,271375:'I hate the way the \nDon does things. \nThis ain't right.'
261377,271376:'Damn it! \nWhy are all the \nstrong men dying?'
261378,271377:'If the Empire tries to muscle in,\nthere's no way the Union as it \nis now can stand up to them.'
261379,261381,271378,271406:'I wonder how long \nDahngrest will hold...'
261380,271405:'It's times like this I wish \nthe Don and Barbos\nwere still with us...'
261382,261386,261392,261404,271379,271383,271389,271399:'Hey! Whaddaya think you're \ndoin' just wanderin' around?'
261383,261385,261387,261389,261393,261405,271380,271382,271384,271386,271390,271400:'Well?! You got a \nproblem, buddy?!'
261384,271381:'Th-the barrier broke?! \nThat's impossible!! \nIs the Empire behind this?!'
261388,271385:'Yo, buddy! \nYou sure you ain't an \nEmpire spy? Huh?!'
261390,271387:'The Blood Alliance\nshould just take over \nthe Union already.'
261391:'And then beat the living \ncrap out of the Empire!'
261394,271391:'A treaty of friendship? \nAre you crazy?'
261395:'Ain't nobody getting \nfriendly with the Empire.'
261396,271393:'I'm tough, but that \nthing scares even me.'
261397:'Not that it would\nbeat me in a fight,\nmind you.'
261398:'Is it true Belius died?<PAGE>Not that I care \nmuch either way.'
261399:'Hey, I've got my \nhands full taking \ncare of myself!'
261400:'All this commotion... \nWhat a pain...<PAGE>What, can he go and do \nanything he wants, just \n'cause he is Don?'
261401:'Prepared to die? Hah! \nThat's ridiculous. Like \nanyone could do that...'
261402,271397:'The Don is dead. \nHah hah... I get it. \nI'm dreaming...'
261403,271398:'I just don't know...'
261406,271401,271403:'Come on, give me a break... \nThis is just crazy.'
261407,271402,271404:'If nothing else, we gotta \nprotect Dahngrest.'
261408,271409:'Be careful. \nThe brighter the light, \nthe darker the shadows.'
261409,271410:'Don't go walking into any alleys. \nDon't whine if you get yourself \nkilled... That's Dahngrest.'
261410,271411:'Well, well. \nIt's nice the guild\nfolks all fired up.'
261411,271412:'Monsters aren't my style. \nPeople are.'
261412,271413:'We take the barriers for granted, \nbut when you think about it \nthey're pretty incredible.'
261413,271414:'They're so much a part of \nour lives that nobody thinks \ntoo hard about them, but...'
261414,261415,271415,271416:'Human marks. \nThat's where we come in.'
261416,271417:'The Don, or Barbos. \nWonder who I should \nwork for...?'
261417,271418:'It doesn't really matter, \nas long as I get paid.'
261418,271419:'If only I could kill Ragou\nwith my own hands.'
261419,271420:'You'd be surprised how many folks \nthere are that some people wouldn't \nmind seeing disappear...'
261420,271421:'You say that Ragou's \nas good as free?<PAGE>I swear, everyone and \neverything is rotten. \n...I bet you are too.'
261421,271422:'Right now, the only people \ninnocent enough to face the \nheavens are small children.'
261422,271423:'Those monsters are divine \npunishment to humans \nfor the reckless behavior.<PAGE>It's too late to \nregret it now.'
261423,271424:'Now, for good people \nlike me, it's time to \nget out of here.'
261424,271425:'I heard Ragou\nturned up dead.<PAGE>The Union put a bounty \non him, but I guess \nsomeone got to him first.'
261425,271426:'Karma makes the world \ngo 'round, I guess.'
261426,271427:'Things are bad...<PAGE>But this is my chance \nto make some money...'
261427,271428:'But I have no obligations \nto the Union.<PAGE>Mercenaries will fight for \nwhoever pays us best.'
261428,271429:'Hey, what's going on? \nWhat's everyone doing here?<PAGE>A battle with \nPalestralle could start \nany minute, you know.'
261429,271430:'If you keep just hanging \naround, their people are \ngonna take the town!'
261430,271457:'In the end, the Don was \njust another person.<PAGE>He was not superhuman. \nHe was not immortal.'
261431,271458:'There was no \none who could kill \nthat old man after all.<PAGE>The only one who \ncould kill the Don was \nthe Don himself.'
261432,271459:'I wonder who ended \nup killing Ragou?<PAGE>He was mine. I should \nkill whoever it was \nthat took my prize.'
261433,271460:'Ragou only got what \nwas coming to him\nsooner or later.'
261434,271461:'I have no idea what \ncan be done to defeat \nthe evil in this world.'
261435,271462:'There's no clear \nline between what's \ngood and what's evil.'
261436,271463:'I don't know what \nthe line is between \ngood and evil.<PAGE>But destroying the world \ncrosses way over that line.'
261437,271464:'Are you ready \nto take a stand \nagainst evil?'
261438,271431:'I came here with my \nhusband, but I had no idea \nthis was such a large town.'
261439,271432:'This place really \nhas a different energy \nthan Zaphias.'
261440,271433:'Wh-what are the Knights doing? \nTh-they told us to run, but \nwhere are we supposed to go?'
261441,271434:'Grrr! \nWhere has my idiot of a \nhusband run off to?'
261442,271435:'That really was something! \nWhat a city! The citizens \ndefend it all by themselves.'
261443,271436:'And that man, the one \nthey call "the Don"... \nWow...'
261444:'Wh-what do we do? We'll \nbe in danger if they \nfind out we're nobles!'
261445:'A-are we going to be okay? \nThey'll beat us up if they \nfind out we're nobles!'
261446:'I'm so glad the \nmisunderstanding \nhas been cleared up...<PAGE>Now they won't \nbeat us up.'
261447:'I thought I would \nbe worth more dead \nthan alive.'
261448,261450,271441,271443:'Things have finally quieted \ndown here... Unlike Zaphias, this \nis quite a down-and-dirty town.'
261449,261451,271442,271444:'It can be tiring staying \nin an unfamilar place.'
261452,261453,271445,271446:'What is that?! What's \ngoing on in this city?!'
261454:'The people here \nare nervous. \nWhat is it now?<PAGE>There's just no end to \nthe chaos in this town.'
261455:'At least Zaphias\nis calm and quiet.'
261456:'A lot of people are gathered \nin the town's main street...<PAGE>Isn't that the Don\nsitting in the middle?'
261457:'Why is the Don sitting in \nthe middle of the street...?<PAGE>Something's about \nto go down...'
261458,271449:'Now everyone's \nstrangely quiet... \nI wonder what happened...'
261459,271448,271450:'It's just one thing after \nanother in this town.'
261460,271451,271453,271455:'Oh my... Are things all \nright back in Zaphias?'
261461,271452,271454,271456:'My son and his wife \nare still there...'
261462:'My son and his wife are still in \nthe capital... I said I wanted to \ngo home, but my husband said no. <PAGE>I know it's dangerous, \nbut still...'
261463:'What's become of \nour Zaphias...?'
261464:'A huge tower appeared \ntoward Zaphias, and Aspio\ngot crushed, right?<PAGE>I wonder if Zaphias is \nall right. Scary, scary...'
261465:'Oh, this is so irritating...! I want \nto go home! I want to go home!\nI want to get back to Zaphias...'
261466,271465:'I live in this city \nand help out with \nvarious guild jobs.'
261467,271466:'I love being able to \ninteract with so many \ndifferent people.'
261468,271467:'I-I have lived in this town \nfor many a year, but I have \nnever seen the barrier fail!!'
261469,271468:'B-but this town is my \ntown! I-I shall strive to \nprotect it with my life!'
261470,261471,271469,271470:'I am so pleased the \nbarrier is back in operation! \nNow we can rest easy.'
261472,261473,271471,271472:'Of course they're angry here. \nThis town was built by people \nwronged by the Empire.'
261474,271473:'Fights even happen between \nthe guilds themselves.'
261475,271474:'Why do people fight...?'
261476,271475:'Things here in Dahngrest\nare finally back to normal.'
261477,271476:'I love this city.'
261478,271477:'I love it when this \ncity's filled with people's \nlaughter and voices.<PAGE>The fighting has \nstopped and things \nhave calmed down.'
261479,271478:'I'm so glad that \npeace has returned...'
261480,271479:'A lot of things have \nhappened in this city.<PAGE>It just goes to show \nthat life's not all \nfun and games.'
261481,271480:'Life's not always fun. \nThat is the biggest \ndilemma with living.'
261482,271481:'Everyone's worried \nthat people will start \nfighting each other again.'
261483,271482:'Whose blood will flow...? \nHow much this time...?'
261484,271483:'I knew of no other \nman like the Don.\nIt's such a great loss.'
261485,271484:'It's such a great loss.\nDon... Rest in peace...'
261486,271485:'I believe the blastia brought \nabout the catastrophe \nZaphias is facing.'
261487,271486:'Is the aer going \nout of control? \nWhat's going on?'
261488,271487:'Wait... That monster \nin the sky... Is that \nthing made of...aer...?'
261489,271488:'How could that...?'
261490,271489:'A monster made of aer... \nI feel like I've heard that story \nlong ago someplace...'
261491,271490:'I never could have \nimagined something so big \nit could cover the sky...'
261492,261496:'You want to see the Don?<PAGE>There's no way \nthe Don would meet \nwith kids like you.'
261493,261497:'Even if he did, he'd \nkill you in an instant.'
261494:'Ain't no Knights here. \nWe--the guilds--protect \nthis town!'
261495,271494:'You all gotta be \nready for the worst!'
261498:'I was thinking of \ngoing to the Union jail \nfor a little bit.<PAGE>I want to go laugh \nat the Knight they caught.'
261499,271498:'That Knight dragged people into \njail, and now he's in jail himself...\nBet he's not laughing now.'
261500,271499:'They went and let \nthat Knight out of jail.'
261501,271500:'What are they doing, \nslacking at the jail \nat a time like this?'
261502,271501:'It'd be nice if something \nhappened around here.'
261503,271502:'I can't stand days \nwith no excitement.'
261504,271503:'There's no point in \nsigning a treaty! We should \ngo crush the Empire.'
261505,271504:'To hell with the \nEmpire. We should go \nwipe them off the map.'
261506,271505:'What the...?! \nWhat is that thing?!'
261507,271506:'Whoa...! \nOne screw up \nand we're dead.'
261508,271507:'...Now things are starting \nto get interesting...<PAGE>This is the way \nthe world should be... \nHah hah hah hah...'
261509,271508:'Palestralle is furious about \nthe Duce getting killed.<PAGE>I wonder what'll \nhappen now...'
261510,271509:'The Don's time is done. \nWhose time is it now?'
261511,271510:'Now the Union's gonna fall apart.'
261512,271511:'The Empire's in \nbad shape, too.'
261513,271512:'Serves them right.'
261514,271513:'W-we're safe as long as we stay\ninside the barrier, right?'
261515,271514:'Hey, I can laugh \nbecause it's not me.'
261516,271515:'What the hell is happening?'
261517,271516:'This is a dream...\nThis is all a dream, \nI'm telling you...'
261518,261522:'Union headquarters \nare up ahead. Did you \nwant to see the Don?<PAGE>The guy's scary. Don't \nsay I didn't warn you \nif you pee in your pants.'
261519,261523:'There are some people who \nget so nervous they can't \nspeak in front of the Don.'
261520,271519:'Hunting the monsters is our job. \nIt ain't funny if other guilds\ntry to muscle in on our territory!'
261521,271520:'We Hunting Blades\nwill lose face if the \nmonsters defeat us!'
261524,271523:'I don't kill \npeople willingly.<PAGE>It's not about morals \nor taking lives. \nIt's just my policy.'
261525,271524:'Whatever. I gotta pay \nthe Empire back. I'm \ngonna have some fun.'
261526,271525:'A guild feud, huh?\nThat's not so bad \nevery now and then.'
261527,271526:'A guild struggle, huh? \nThat has nothing to do \nwith us Hunting Blades.'
261528,261530,271527,271529:'Looks like the \nsummons from the \nchief isn't happening yet.'
261529,261531,271528,271530:'I wonder what kind of monster \nthe chief is going to hunt next.'
261532,271531:'Damn, that damn monster... \nWe can't do anything when \nwe're here on the ground!'
261533,271532:'Flying through the sky... \nStupid monsters... Cowards, \nget down here and fight!<PAGE>Of course they're cowards. \nThey're monsters.'
261534:'I hear the chief \nwent a little wild\nin Nordopolica.<PAGE>I wonder what \nthe target was.'
261535:'I wonder if Nan and Tison\nare doing all right.<PAGE>I haven't caught \nmuch lately.'
261536,271561:'Everyone dies. \nBut the Don did \nit with style.'
261537,271562:'I never thought I'd see the \nDon's final moments \nwith my own eyes.'
261538,271563:'I hope the Hunting \nBlades are all right.'
261539,271564:'Tison and I started together. \nWe haven't worked together \nfor a while though...'
261540,271565:'Monsters are evil. \nBig monsters \nare big evils.<PAGE>We should get rid \nof the big evils \nbefore the little ones.'
261541,271566:'But that'd be tough, \neven with the strength \nof the Hunting Blades.'
261542:'...For a monster, that \nthing's just a little \ntoo big to feel real.<PAGE>Oh well. \nWe gotta take it down \nlike any other monster...!'
261543,271568:'But it's too big... \nI'm just not feeling this...'
261544,261548:'You can't rely on anybody \nfrom the Empire.'
261545,261549,271540:'They don't give a damn \nabout common people. \nStuck up, little...'
261546:'What?! What's going on?! \nWhy would the barrier fail?'
261547:'Whoa, whoa, what the \nhell is this? What \nthe hell's going on?'
261550,271541,271542:'We'll stick with the Don to the \nend! And we'll "don" our finest \narmor to do it! Hah hah hah!!'
261551:'You guys wanna join us?'
261552,271543,271544:'So that piece of crap \nBarbos finally showed \nhis true colors...'
261553:'Well, everyone already \nknew about that Barbos.'
261554,271545,271546:'So, I guess peace once \nagain comes to Dahngrest.'
261555:'The value of peace \ncan only be understood \nby those who know war.'
261556,271547:'I support the treaty \nof friendship.'
261557,271548:'We're better off without \nwar, you know?'
261558,271549,271550:'Whoa, whoa, trouble again? \nWhat the hell's going on?'
261559:'There's just no end to \nproblems in this world.'
261560:'You'd have to be \ncrazy to pick a fight \nwith Palestralle.<PAGE>It's dangerous\nto get on their\nbad side...'
261561:'I don't think just taking \nresponsibility is gonna \nstop things anymore...'
261562,271553,271555:'You can't move forward \nif you're bound by sadness.'
261563,271554,271556:'We have to keep everything \nthe Don taught us in our \nhearts, and press on.'
261564:'We can't grieve one \nman's death forever.<PAGE>Time goes on, and memories fade. \nThat's just the way it is.'
261565:'All that matters is that we \nkeep feeling the presence \nof the Don in this city.'
261566,261570:'There's a monster in \nthe sky... I wonder what \nthe Don would do...'
261567,261571:'If the Don were here... \nNo, the Don isn't \nhere anymore.<PAGE>We have to decide \nfor ourselves.'
261568:'How embarrassing \nfor Harry. I mean, \nhe's an adult.<PAGE>He was crying \njust now, right?'
261569:'I thought that \ncry-baby Harry\nhad grown up.<PAGE>But ever since Nordopolica, \nI don't feel that at all.'
261572:'We have to decide \nfor ourselves...<PAGE>But when it comes \ndown to it, it's so \nmuch pressure...'
261573:'...It's times like \nthese, I know just how \ngreat a man the Don was.'
261574,261575,262522,262524,262668,262670,272527,272529,272671,273458,273460,273462,273464,273466,273489,275220:'......'
261576,271571:'W-we'll be fine.\nThe Don will do \nsomething about this.'
261577,271572:'Th-this town has always \nbeen that way. There's \nnothing to worry about.'
261578,271573:'See? I was right. \nThe Don took care \nof things.'
261579,271574:'Th-this town has always \nbeen that way. See? \nNothing to worry about.'
261580,271575:'The Empire, the Knights... \nNobody in this town \ntrusts them at all.'
261581,271576:'The Imperial Council and the Knights \nwouldn't stand a chance if the guilds\nbanded together to take them on.'
261582,271577:'Curse that Barbos! \nHe's disgraced the guilds!'
261583,271578:'This isn't any time \nfor the guilds to \nbe fighting!'
261584,271579:'Guess things got \nwrapped up nicely.'
261585,271580:'That Ragou guy \ngot away, though...'
261586,271581:'I respect the Don, but \nI'm not big on the idea \nof a friendship treaty.'
261587,271582:'I can't believe the \nDon would sign a treaty \nwith the Empire...<PAGE>Wait, this is the Don. \nCould it be to throw \nthe Empire off guard?'
261588,271583:'What the hell is that?!'
261589,271584:'I never seen anything \nlike that, much less \neaten anything like it!'
261590:'The fun never \nends in this town.<PAGE>But I guess Dahngrest\nwouldn't be Dahngrest\nif it were quiet.'
261591:'Of course, that's exactly \nwhy I like Dahngrest.<PAGE>It'd be missing something \nif it were just some \nquiet, sleepy town.'
261592,275202:'I get the feeling the old \nera is ending, and a new \none is about to begin.'
261593,275203:'It's so exciting to \nlive in times of change.'
261594,275204:'What's going to \nhappen now?'
261595,275205:'My uneasiness is \nlike a dark cloud \nmoving into my heart.'
261596,275206:'We have to protect this \ntown ourselves. We don't \nhave anyone else to rely on.'
261597,275207:'This is the time for all guilds\nto pull their strength together.'
261598,275208:'Is it imprudent of me \nto think that this state \nof the world is...fun?'
261599,275209:'People are coming together \nnow. Even if the world came \nto an end now, I'd die happy.'
261600,271587:'My mommy's a guild\nbigshot! Really! \nI even met the Don!'
261601,271588:'The Don's an even \nbigger bigshot! Not just \nanybody can meet him.'
261602,261614,264992,271589,271601,271609,271611:'Waaah, waaah...'
261603,261615,264993,271590,271602,271610,271612:'Mommy! Mommy! \nWhere are you?!'
261604,271591,271592:'My mommy fought, too! I'm \ngonna be a guild when \nI grow up, just like her!'
261605:'When I grow up, I'm \ngonna be a guild!\n...Be a...guild?'
261606,271593,271594:'Even if the Empire attacks, \nthe Don'll beat them up good!'
261607:'Even if the Empire attacks, \nI'm going to help the Don\nfight them!'
261608,271595:'Mommy says someone called \nBarbos is the bad guy.'
261609,271596:'Don't you wish \nbad guys would all \njust go away?'
261610,271597:'We're back at peace! \nThat's what my mommy said.'
261611:'Even the neighbors \nwere saying that \npeace is best.'
261612,271599:'Now we're gonna be \nfriends with the Empire?'
261613,271600:'I guess being \nfriends is nice.'
261616,271603,271604:'Mommy says something's \ngonna happen.'
261617:'They say something's gonna \nhappen, but what? A party?'
261618,261620,271623,271625:'It sure is crazy out there. \nFancy a drink before you go?'
261619,261621,271624,271626:'I wanna go see what's \ngoing on out there, but \nI got customers to serve.'
261622,271627:'We got anything you want.\nFancy a drink before you go?'
261623:'Zaphias Brew, Ehmead Snow, Dese \nDraft... They're good drinks \nthat do down like water.'
261624,271629:'We'll hold a banquet \nhere when the friendship \ntreaty is signed.'
261625:'I'll bring out the really good \nbooze when that happens!'
261626:'What was that noise? Another \nmonster? If you need another \nhand, I have one to lend.'
261627,271632:'Even if it means I have to use \nan empty bottle as a weapon, \nI'll do it to protect this town.'
261628:'The customers have a lot \nto complain about lately.<PAGE>I know what that's like.'
261629:'But it's part of \nmy job to listen,\nso I can't join in.'
261630,271635:'Careful not to drown your \ncares in too much drink. You'll \njust make yourself sick.'
261631,271636:'The Don was quite \na drinker, you know.\nHe came by often.'
261632,271637:'Fancy a drink before you go?'
261633:'What do you like? \nCocktails? Wine? Whiskey?<PAGE>Or maybe rain water is good \nenough for you? We also have hot \nmiso soup, if that's your fancy.'
261634,271639:'Many customers come here\nas an escape from reality.<PAGE>Personal relationships\nin the guilds can be\npretty stressful.'
261635,271640:'Even I work here\nto escape from reality.'
261636,271641:'Have any troubles \nyou want to unload?\nI'll listen to anything.<PAGE>I am the bartender \nhere, after all.'
261637,271642:'I'm the bartender, \nnot the bar or a bender. \nThe bartender!'
261638,271643:'Hmph... I can't even drink in \npeace and quiet in this town.'
261639,271644:'Seriously, what is all \nthe commotion about?'
261640,271645:'Barbos... That's the chief \nof the Blood Alliance, right?'
261641,271646:'I hear that guy\nhas some skill.'
261642:'So Barbos is gone, huh?'
261643,271647:'People dying... \nThat's exactly how \ntimes change.'
261644,271648,271649:'Someone long ago once told me\nthat work is what you make of it.<PAGE>If I have to make it,\nthen I'd rather not bother.'
261645,271650:'...Isn't there any work?'
261646:'What? A monster \nconvered in flames?\nYou drunk?'
261647:'Yeah, I'm drunk, \nbut I ain't about to say \nanything stupid like you.'
261648:'I'm just a mercenary. \nWhat was I thinking, helping \nto repair that bridge?<PAGE>Well, I guess it would \nbe pretty inconvenient \nwithout a bridge.'
261649:'Now that the bridge is fixed, \nthey're having me figure out \nthe costs of the repairs.<PAGE>I'm telling you, this \nis not part of my job.'
261650:'The Don was \nthe Don, right \nto the end.'
261651,271656:'I've never met any other man\nlike the Don in my whole life.'
261652,271657:'There's trouble in the Empire? \n Well, that news makes my day.'
261653,271658:'There's trouble in the Empire? \nWell, that's nothing new.'
261654,271659:'Things are so bad lately \nI can't even get by \nwithout a drink.'
261655:'Ooooh... *Hic!*'
261656:'Nothing is solved by \ndrinking. I know that.<PAGE>But I can't get by \nwithout my alcohol.'
261657,271662:'*Hic!* I can't believe I'm \ndrunk after 10 iced teas...'
261658,261660,261662,261664,261666,261668,261670,261672,261674,271663,271665,271667,271669,271671,271673,271675,271677,271679:'I ain't drunk!'

261676,271681:'The world's in crisis! \nNow I'm gonna save it!'
261677,271682:'Huh? No, I'm not drunk.'
261678,271683:'This is a fine drink. \nFortune's Market sure knows \nhow to pick the right stuff.'
261679,271684:'When business is good,\ndrinking is that much more fun.'
261680,271685:'I make my own way no matter how \ncrazy things get. That's how you do \nthings when you're part of a guild.'
261681,271686:'It's a disgrace for a guildsman\nto get caught up in every new \ntrend that comes along.'
261682,271687:'I come here every day...\nI wonder if I'm living a decent life...'
261683,271688:'I know my tab \nis getting up there...<PAGE>What's even scarier is no one's \npressuring me to pay...'
261684,271689:'I haven't done \nany real work lately.'
261685,271690:'Guess it doesn't matter.'
261686:'Monsters, you say? \nWhere are your manners? \nCan't you see I'm drinking?<PAGE>Ask someone else \nwho has the time.'
261687:'These guys drink all day. \nIf you need a favor, ask around \nfor someone with nothing to do.'
261688:'I hear someone let slip \nthat Leviathan's Claw\nis making a move.<PAGE>I guess it's tough\neverywhere you go.'
261689:'Nothing good ever \ncomes when Leviathan's \nClaw makes a move.'
261690,271695,271697:'There are times when \nyou just want to drink and \nforget about everything.'
261691,271696,271698:'Sometimes you just can't get \nanything done. I'm just biding \nmy time until I can do something.'
261692:'Drinks can fool even \nterminal illnesses.'
261693:'Alcohol is the cure for everything.\nBut don't go drinking too much.'
261694:'I want to do something \nbefore I really regret it.'
261695,271700:'But I just can't pry \nmy hands off this bottle...'
261696,271701:'I heard there's a sword style \ncalled Drunken Sword. It lets \nyou fight even while drinking.<PAGE>I want to learn it.'
261697,271702:'If I could master Drunken Sword, \nI could work while I drink...'
261698,271703:'This is where we mercenaries \nscout for work.'
261699,271704:'Don't bother me.'
261700,271705:'Thanks to Barbos, attitudes \ntowards us mercenaries\nhave gotten pretty cold.'
261701,271706:'I'm may be a mercenary, \nbut I'm not part of the \nBlood Alliance...'
261702,261704,271707,271709:'I'm scrambling every day\nto regain the trust of\nthe tarnished mercenaries.<PAGE>Damn it, it's all \nBarbos's fault.'
261703,261705,271708,271710:'How hard do I have to work\nto regain that trust...?'
261706:'Hey, I saw it, that bird monster! \nMan, we're in trouble!<PAGE>I know we mercenaries are supposed \nto regain the trust of the people, \nbut fighting that thing...?'
261707:'If you want that thing dead,\ntry barking up another guild.'
261708,271713:'More resistance among \nthe guilds? It better not be \nanother mercenary guild.'
261709,271714:'Any more bad reflections \non the mercenaries, and \nwe'll seriously be out of work.'
261710,271715:'The more chaos befalls the \nworld, the more the mercenary \nbusiness flourishes.<PAGE>Even so, it is forbidden for us \nto create conflicts ourselves.'
261711,271716:'Trust is number one in the guild business.\nIf you're caught cheating the system,\nyou'll be banished from the industry.'
261712,271717:'I bet I could find plenty of jobs\nin Zaphias right now.'
261713,271718:'Of course, that's only \nif I could make it there.'
261714,271719:'My sword is no match for that \nnasty monster in the sky.<PAGE>I don't think there's \nany other sword who can \ntake it down either...'
261715,271720:'No mercenary could \ntake that thing down.<PAGE>There's nothing we can do...'
261716,271721:'Confusion is spreading \nthroughout the world... \nThis is our moment to shine.<PAGE>This is a chance for \nus to make some \ndough before we die!'
261717,271722:'I can protect a town, \ntravelers, you name it.<PAGE>What do you guys say, \nyou want to hire me?'
261718:'Don't talk to me \nor you'll get hurt.'
261719:'Don't talk to me \nor I'll bite.'

261737:'Don't talk to me \nor I'll talk.'
261738,271743:'I might join for the \nchance to go up \nagainst the Empire.'
261739,271744:'I can hardly wait to \nget in the action again. \nIt's been a while.'
261740:'First knights, now mercenaries.'
261741,271746:'I don't know how I feel \nabout killing colleagues.'
261742,271747:'I can't believe the Blood \nAlliance--the largest mercenary \nguild--could be defeated so easily.'
261743,271748:'Wonder who stuck it \nto Barbos, anyway.'
261744,271749:'I don't think it's \ngoing to be too easy \ngetting the treaty signed.'
261745,271750:'There's not chance the guilds\nand the Empire can get along.'

262097,272105:'I'll help out when \nI'm done eating. \nJust wait a sec.'
262098,272106:'What?! They took care of the \nproblem with the Knights? Then \nI didn't have to eat so fast...'
262100:'This might be the only chance \nfor me to take my time.'
262101:'I'm going to eat while I can. \nBartender! Food! Bring me food!'
262102,262106,272109,272113:'It looks like I can \neat in peace today.'
262103,262107,272108,272110,272114:'Bartender! \nFood! \nBring me food!'
262104,272111:'What? Monsters again?!\nJust let me eat in peace!'
262108,272115:'The Don will never eat\na meal again, will he...?'
262109,262111,262113,262115,272116,272118,272120,272122:'No matter how much I eat, \nI just don't feel satisfied.'
262110,272117:'Do the people in Zaphias\nhave food to eat?'
262112,262114,272119,272121:'At this point I might \nas well chow down on \neverything in sight!'
262118:'The barrier disappeared. \nHow should I respond \nto this situation?'
262119:'There's no way \nthe monsters could \nbring it down, right?'
262120:'They say someone tampered \nwith the barrier blastia.'
262121:'We'll have to put the barrier \nblastia under much heavier \nguard from now on.'
262122:'Even our mighty barrier \nwon't protect us against \nthe Imperial Knights.'
262123:'If only we had a barrier \nthat worked against people.'
262124:'Was the barrier failure \nBarbos's work, too?'
262125,272132:'Seems like there's a \ngood chance for that.'
262126,262128:'The barrier is stable for another day. \nAs long as we have the barrier, \nthe town is at peace.'
262127,262129:'The barrier is a symbol \nof this town's peace.'
262130:'The monsters penetrated \nthe barrier so easily. \nAre we even safe?'
262131,272138:'Is the barrier that \nvulnerable, or are these \nnot normal monsters...?'
262132:'The barrier failure, the monsters \nattacking... So much for the \nfairytale about barrier safety.<PAGE>Sure, we're safer with it, \nbut it's no guarantee.'
262133,272140:'Even the peace we have right now\nis only a temporary thing.'
262134:'Barriers protect us from monsters, \nbut they can't protect us from \nthe evil of other humans.<PAGE>The Don protected \nus from that.'
262135,272142:'What you can protect, and \nhow you protect it... It \nchanges with the situation.'
262136:'The barrier in Zaphias\nis acting up.<PAGE>If you put all your trust in the barrier, \nit could hurt you in the end.'
262137,272144:'The people of Zaphias\nmust be very worried...'
262138,272145:'It seems that the \nbarrier is of no use against \nthe flying monster. <PAGE>The days where the barrier \nreigned supreme are now over.'
262139,272146:'There was a time when people \nthought they could live in peace \nas long as there was a barrier...'
262140:'The time may have come \nwhere we need to find a way \nto live without the barrier.'
262141,272148:'The times are starting \nto change.'
262144,272149,272151:'Young people nowadays! \nStriding into bars in \nthe middle of the day.'
262145,272150,272152:'Me? I can come in \nwhenever I like.\nI'm an old man.'
262146,272153:'Such a fuss over one or \ntwo barriers going bad.'
262147,272154:'I just don't understand \nkids these days.'
262148,272155:'No matter how much the \nEmpire may struggle, they're \nno match for the Don.'
262149,272156:'He's the strongest man I \nknow. Next to me, of course.'
262150,272157:'Barbos doesn't know \nhis place.'
262151,272158:'What he needs is a lesson. \nAnd I'll smack some \nlearning into his head!'
262152,262154,272159,272161:'People from the Empire\nhave begun to show \ntheir faces around here.'
262153,262155,272160,272162:'I despise the Empire.'
262156,272163:'What in the world is \nthat creature in the sky? \nI got a bad feeling...'
262157,272164:'My bad feelings always \nturn out to be right.'
262158:'The Knights helped \nus repair our bridge.<PAGE>I guess there are some \ndecent Knights, after all.'
262159:'It's the same with the guilds. \nYou got some decent guys, \nand some not-so-decent.'
262160,272167:'All of Dahngrest\nis in mourning.'
262161,272168:'But it won't last long. \nThat's not what the Don\nwould have wanted.'
262162,272169:'The young are still \nin despair over the \nDon's death.<PAGE>It just goes to show\nwhat a huge influence\nthat old man had.'
262163,272170:'The young people \nmust truly stand firm now \nthat the Don has passed on.'
262164,272171:'If only I were twenty \nyears younger... I'd take \nthat monster out quick.'
262165,262167,272172,272174:'Ohh, my back...'
262166,272173:'I will not be \noutdone by kids!'
262170,272175,272177:'I'm just here for a visit, \nand the barrier disappears! \nTalk about bad luck...'
262171,272176,272178:'I'm just really unlucky. \nYeah, really unlucky.'
262172,272179:'The barrier was fixed... \nNow I can breathe a \nsigh of relief.'
262173,272180:'I can have a good \ndrink here. Maybe my \nluck has turned a little.'
262174,272181:'Sometimes the solidarity \nof the guilds\ncan \nbe a painful thing.'
262175,272182:'People with conviction \nwho get bound up by rules \ncan often do crazy things.'
262176,272183:'Barbos is only doing \nwhat he thinks is right.'
262177,272184:'Don't like it? \nYour only choice is to resist \nwith a show of force.'
262178,262180,272185,272187:'It's so nice to enjoy a \ngood meal while listening \nto this beautiful music.'
262179,262181,272186,272188:'Hey, why don't you take \nit easy and enjoy a nice \nmeal once in a while?'
262182,272189:'That monster in \nflames seems like it's \nlooking for something.'
262183,272190:'Do you think it has some \nkind of intelligence?\nNo, that's impossible.'
262184,272191:'There's going to be a lot \nof casualties if it comes to \nfacing Palestralle head-on.'
262185,272192:'Belius, from Palestralle, \nis just as important to \nthe guilds as the Don is.'
262186,272193:'Belius and the Don... \nEveryone knew and respected them,\nand now, one after the other...'
262187,272194:'They say Leviathan's Claw\nis pulling the strings.'
262188,272195:'The kindling that started \nin the Empire looks like it \nwill spread to the world.<PAGE>It's times like these that try \nthe unity of the guilds.'
262189,272196:'We all have to work \ntogether to prepare for \nunforseen situations.'
262190,272197:'The Imperial Knights and \nthe Council are weak, \nand there's no Emperor.<PAGE>Now's the time for the guilds\nto take over the Empire.'
262191,272198:'This is the perfect time \nto overthrow the Empire. \nBut no one's standing up.<PAGE>If only the Don\nwere here...'
262192,272199:'If the Union would band \ntogether, there'd be \nnothing to be afraid of.<PAGE>Let's kill monster in \nthe sky already.'
262193,272200:'Our true enemy \nis the Empire, \nnot that rabble!'
262196,272201,272203:'To fight or not to fight. \nThat is the question.<PAGE>...But thinking about it \ndoesn't bring any answers...'
262197,272202,272204:'What would be best is if \nthe monsters went away while \nI'm thinking about it.'
262198,272205:'The monsters went away \nwhile I was still wondering \nwhether to fight or not.<PAGE>I guess that's what I was \nasking for, but...I'm \na little disappointed.'
262199,272206:'I'm a little disappointed I didn't \nget to show what I can do.'
262200,272207:'To join the fight with \nthe Imperial Knights or not. \nThat is the question.<PAGE>...I really don't \nwant to go.'
262201,272208:'What would be best is \nif it all ended while \nI'm thinking about it.'
262202,272209:'Barbos should be left \nto the Imperial Knights.<PAGE>There's no reason to \nfight pointless battles.'
262203,272210:'I'll just drink and \nsleep well tonight.'
262204,272211:'I hear the Knights \ndefeated Barbos.<PAGE>I'm a little disappointed \nI didn't get a chance to \nshow my true strength.'
262205,272212:'I always end up regretting \nall the wrong choices \nI keep making.'

262207,272214:'It's just easier to go with \nwhichever side wins out...'
262208,272215:'There's a huge monster \nnear the bridge?<PAGE>No way. \nThere's nothing \nthat I can do.'
262209,272216:'Is that huge monster \nstill out there?'
262210,272217:'So the Imperial Knights used \ntheir hoplon blastia to chase \nthat huge monster away.<PAGE>I'm disappointed that I \ncouldn't use my strength \nto chase it away myself.'
262211:'I failed to seize \nthe opportunity to show \nmy true strength.<PAGE>What? Palestralle? \nTh-that's out of \nmy league...'
262212,272219:'The Don died while I was \njust sitting around worrying.'
262213,272220:'I'm such a failure...'
262214,272221:'...I've been reborn. \nI will protect this town.<PAGE>No matter what happens, \nI will not waver. \nI will not run away.'
262215,272222:'I know I said I \nwouldn't run away...<PAGE>...But I'm still a \nlittle scared...'

262217,272224:'I-I have no choice. I'll see \nhow things go from here for a \nlittle while, then I'll join in.'

262632,272627:'I just stopped in here at \nMantaic on my vacation, but it \nreally is a lovely town, isn't it?'
262633,272628:'I heard some horror stories \nabout the Knights here, but they \ndon't seem to be a problem now. '
262634,272629:'Apparently a large number of \ntroops came here a while ago, \nand then left quickly.<PAGE>Whatever could have happened?'
262635,272630:'Not that the comings and goings \nof soldiers has any bearing \non my vacation, of course.'
262636,272631:'Wh-what is that nasty \nthing in the sky? '
262637,272632:'I once had a meal prepared by a \nyoung lady from the family of my \nacquaintances, the Kimlascas.<PAGE>Compared to that meal, \nthe thing in the sky \nisn't very vile at all.'

262669:'Get out of here... \nYou're annoying... '

262677:'The Trino Liner Service is a sailing \nGuild. Neither wind nor rain can \nstop our ship, the Stratos...<PAGE>...But it isn't too much \nof a match for storms.'
262678:'Welcome... How I wish I could \nsay that. The Liner Service \nis out of operation.'
262679:'The Stratos, flagship of the Trino \nLiner Service sailing Guild, is \ncurrently being overhauled!<PAGE>You'll have to wait a bit longer before \nservice resumes, I'm afraid.'
262680:'Welcome... But then that would be \na lie, wouldn't it? The Liner \nService is suspended right now.'
262681:'They say Don Whitehorse \npassed on.<PAGE>We can't confirm what the \nsituation's like in Capua Torim, \nso we can't set sail.'
262682:'Welcome... Sorry, I'm just kidding. \n*Sigh*... Liner Service \nis suspended right now.'
262683:'Our sailing Guild, Trino Liner Service, is currently \nlending out the Stratos to the Knights. \nThey need it to get evacuees to safety.<PAGE>I'm afraid we aren't running regular \nservice right now. Please understand.'
262684:'Welcome... Oh, how I want to be \nable to say that. Liner Service \nisn't in operation right now.'
262685:'Some strange structure \nsprang out of the sea!<PAGE>People say it even sucks ships \nin. It's way too dangerous, so \nthe Liner Service is suspended.'
262686:'Welcome... Oh, why do I even \nkeep saying it. Liner Services \nare completely suspended.'
262687:'The Trino Liner Services \nhasn't set sail \nin months.<PAGE>The Guild is strapped for cash, all thanks to \nour ship being strapped down...oh, I don't \neven know what I'm talking about anymore.'
262688,272693:'What is that tower? <PAGE>I hope it doesn't interfere \nwith the operation \nof the ship...'
262689:'That has nothing to do with the sea \nbecause that happened on the mountain! \nBut that's something I can't say. '
262690:'Welcome! Welcome \nto Trino Freight!<PAGE>The Liner Service? It wasn't \nbringing in any money, so we \nchanged our business model.'
262691:'It's been a string of \ncataclysmic catastrophes \nlately, on sky, land and sea!<PAGE>With things being as they \nare, freight service is \nbringing in big money.'
262692:'Welcome, have a look \nat our wares!'

262719:'Can you sense it? The very \nwill of the stones...<PAGE>...Yes, the stony will \nof the stones...\n...Sorry. A little joke.'
262722:'The stones are omniscient. They \nknow the height of the sky...the \ndepth of the seas.<PAGE>But do they know where my wife's \nsecret nest-egg is hidden...? \nThat's the real question...'
262725:'Anything is possible as long \nas you have the stones... \nI used to believe that.'
262728:'You want to test the stones? \nVery well... Wait. That young \nlady's not with you.<PAGE>I just can't get \ninto it if that lady's \nnot here...'
262729,262730:'I only challenge those in \nwhom I take interest.<PAGE>I can't use the stones \nconstantly. That would \nbe rude to them!'
262731:'I have 10,000 stones in \nmy collection. Quite \nimpressive, I'd say.'
262734:'If you're tired, why not sit \ndown to play Stone-Taking with \nme? It's quite refreshing.'
262737:'Stones are the perfect refreshment. \nRolling them over and over... This \nis the true path to enlightenment.'
262740:'Any troubles this world may face would pass \nby so easily, if only people would discuss \nthem in tranquility with the stones.'
262743:'One must put unfortunate goings-on \nout of one's mind, come to perfect \ncalm, and merge with the stones...<PAGE>Nnngh...! I cannot \nsee anything...'
262746:'Mmmgh...! See there, the \nstones are shaking, \ncrying out in dismay!<PAGE>What...? It's just \nan earthquake...?'
262749:'Stone-Taking is not an escape from reality! \nNay. It is a technique by which one may \nwitness the very beginning of the world.'
262752:'The stones are as crystals which \npreserve all the world's memory. \nJust look at them...<PAGE>...This one reminds \nme of my wife's face.'
262755:'We're not in business right now \nbecause the magistrate gets a \npercentage by way of taxes.<PAGE>I'm really sorry.'
262756:'This is such a good spot, \nso I'm staying here...<PAGE>I'll set up shop \nhere one day...'
262757:'With Ragou gone, there's going \nto be a new magistrate coming.<PAGE>I just hope the taxes he \nsets are reasonable...'
262758:'Just a few more months... One day \nI'll have a wonderful spread of \nproducts for sale. I'm sure of it...'
262759:'The new magistrate \narrived, but taxes haven't \ngotten any cheaper...<PAGE>I suppose any tariffs the \nEmpire's petty bureaucrats \nset aren't easily lowered.'
262760:'When am I going to be able \nto get back in business...?'
262761:'Things are in chaos over in the \nEmpire...things are in chaos in \nTolbyccia because the Don died.<PAGE>I can't even imagine when I'm going \nto be able to open shop back up...'
262762:'How am I going \nto make a living \nnow...?'
262763:'*Sigh*...paying the rental fee \nfor this spot day in and day out \nis eating away my savings...<PAGE>Why do I stay here? I can't \nlet a location as good as \nthis slip out of my hands.'
262764:'My priorities may be skewed, but \nthere's no way I could convince \nmyself to give this space up.'
262765:'I swear, my luck is even \nworse now than it was when \nRagou was in charge.<PAGE>Do you think it's because I'm \nso obsessed with this spot?'
262766:'Maybe I should give this location up, \nand open up shop in some other town. \nMaybe that would bring me luck...'
262767:'My heart is still racing... <PAGE>I've never seen something \nso unbelievable. '
262768:'I'm still in shock... <PAGE>I'm really a coward.'
262769:'I've made up my mind! \nI'm making a suicide \npact with this spot!<PAGE>I don't care what anyone \nthinks about me. This is \nwhere I'm doing business.'
262770:'If I survive, and if I'm ever able \nto freely stock merchandise, \ncome back and buy something.<PAGE>I'll be waiting for you.'
262771:'There was someone dressed \nall in black wandering around. \nHe was really suspicious. <PAGE>And to think, he's the executioner \nhired by the magistrate... I really \ndon't like the era that we live in...'
262772:'A wise man never courts \ndanger! I'd like to start \nmy business here. <PAGE>But in this world, you can be \nmurdered without doing anything \nwrong... It's unbelievable...'
262773:'I heard a metallic sound behind\nthe alley. I couldn't see anything\nbecause it was dark.<PAGE>I thought someone was being\nmurdered... I guess something\nlike that is not rare in this city.'
262774:'You.... you... came out\nfrom the alley?<PAGE>I never thought you would\nbe stealing because you\ncouldn't pay taxes.'
262775:'I'm always out of stock when \nsupplies don't arrive due to \nharsh ocean conditions. <PAGE>I've never experienced \nanything like this. Why are \nthe ocean conditions like this?'
262776:'Unless there is inventory \nto sell, there's nothing \nto eat tomorrow... <PAGE>It's been like this \never since the \nmagistrate arrived.'
262777:'Woo. It finally \ncleared. <PAGE>At least, clear skies \nbring a little \npiece of mind. '
262778:'Only if the magistrate would \ncome clean as a good person \nunder these blue skies... <PAGE>Like that'll ever happen...'
262779:'Shipping routes for cargo \nare still so unstable...<PAGE>Aaaah! It's all because Fortune's \nMarket monopolizes them!'
262780:'Maybe I should just find out if Fortune's \nMarket will let me join them...'
262781:'Apparently Fortune's Market \nhas their own, exclusive \nshipping routes for cargo...<PAGE>One of them passes across the ice \nfloes to the north. That's impossible \nfor normal folk to compete with!'
262782:'I hear they have to bring their \ncargo over extremely thin ice. \nThey're risking their lives!'
262783:'The port's full of warships and \nthere's some kind of strange \nbuilding out on the sea.<PAGE>Where in the world is \nFortune's Market getting \ntheir merchandise from?'
262784:'Even at a time like this, the \nshop across the way is doing \ngangbuster business.<PAGE>I...I think I want to join \nFortune's Market...'
262785:'The world's gone all to hell lately, \nso I finally made up my mind \nto join Fortune's Market...<PAGE>...But when I applied, they wanted \nme to pay a huge contract deposit! \nI can't afford that!'
262786:'I suppose locals really do \nhave to join hands and work \ntogether, after all...'
262787:'What's the deal, here \nand there... I'm tired \nof this...! <PAGE>I'm sorry, I just got \na little distracted...'
262788:'I wonder if it's over for this \nworld... Is it okay that I'm \ndoing something like this?'
262789:'Earthquakes, the northern mountains \ncrumbling...to be perfectly honest, I \njust want to run away...<PAGE>...But I can't abandon the place \nI was born, much less go beyond \nthe barrier...can I?'
262790:'The people at the shop next door \nseem to be doing their best. \nI suppose I should, too.'
262791:'Are you travelers? Watch \nout. The magistrates in \nthis city are evil. <PAGE>Not only do they take taxes \nfrom their citizens, they \nalso make travelers pay.'
262792:'Our magistrates are evil. They \ndon't have second thoughts \nwhen murdering people. <PAGE>You shouldn't stick around if you \nthink it's going to be dangerous. '
262793:'Ahh, the skies are finally clearing \nup. My sheets can be dried... <PAGE>What? My bed smells \nof mold?! That's just \nthe way it goes.'
262794:'How many days has it been since \nwe've had these blue skies? <PAGE>Ahh... \nIt's warm...'
262795:'This inn is full of history. His \nMajesty the Emperor himself has \nstayed here! Please have a stay.'
262796:'There are so many comings \nand goings in town lately, we \noften have no vacancies.<PAGE>I wonder if this has anything \nto do with some man they \ncall the Don dying in Dahngrest?'
262797:'Right this way, travelers. \nWe still have vacancies. \nPlease have a stay.'
262798:'The refugees from Zaphias only managed to \nescape with the clothes on their backs, so \nthey don't have enough money to stay here.<PAGE>It's a shame. I was hoping the refugees \nwould drum up some business...'
262799:'Ah, hello, traveler. How about spending \na night with us? Both land and sea routes \nare very dangerous right now, you know.'
262800:'I thought we'd always be safe \ninside our barriers...<PAGE>...But when you hear about how the \nbarrier in Zaphias failed...'
262801:'Hello, traveler. I don't know where \nyou're headed, but I do know a night \nspent here would do you some good.'
262802:'Nothing but trouble, from one \nend of the world to the other!<PAGE>A number of people evacuated to \nHypionia by boat, but I imagine \nthings are the same everywhere.'
262803:'Where are you off to? There's \nno need to be so hasty. Why \nnot have a nice rest here?'
262804:'This is it...I'm \nprepared.<PAGE>The world's going to end no matter what we \ndo. Everyone's going to die together. That \nmeans there's nothing left to be afraid of.'
262805:'Oh, Rhybgaros? They \nlike dark places. <PAGE>That's why they only come \nout on rainy days. '
262806:'Gathering under trees for shade...? \nYeah, you could probably find \nRhybgaros doing that.'
262807:'A yellow Rhybgaro! The horns \nof those with yellow skin \nare more expensive! <PAGE>I think the yellow \nones that I saw are \nmore expensive. '
262808:'I'm scared. They're \nyellow monsters. I'm \nscare of Rhybgaros.'
262809:'Welcome to the Port of Capua. \nCapua is divided into Nor to \nthe south and Torim to the north. <PAGE>This is the south side, \nCapua Nor. '
262810:'Nor and Torim are \nboth very spirited \ntowns... <PAGE>However, due to \nthe magistrate...'
262811,262813:'My friend never comes to see me \nany more...ever since she went \nto work at Lord Ragou's manor.<PAGE>Something must have \nhappened...something \nshe can't tell me about.'
262812,262814:'I was told to go work at Lord \nRagou's manor, too, but...<PAGE>...I don't want to go. It frightens me...'
262815:'My friend who worked at Lord \nRagou's manor finally told \nme what she saw there... <PAGE>They blindfolded people who couldn't pay \ntheir taxes, put them in cages, and...*ulp*! \nI-I really don't want to talk about it...'
262816:'Ragou...he was absolute \nscum...I'm so glad \nhe disappeared...<PAGE>I'll never call him \n"Lord Ragou" again.'
262817:'Ragou made all our \nlives difficult.<PAGE>The people living such sumptuous lifestyles \nin Zaphias...I think they should have \nto get a taste of what we went through.'
262818:'Does that make me a horrible \nperson? No...I can think \nwhatever I want.<PAGE>Ah...were you listening \nto me...?'
262819:'They say the barrier in Zaphias \nwas fixed, and some of the \ncitizens have come back.<PAGE>I wish it had just \nstayed broken...'
262820:'I thought it would serve the \npeople in Zaphias right to \ngo through a little pain...'
262821:'This scary change in my personality is \nall Ragou's fault. All I can think about \nlately are terrible, terrible things.<PAGE>It's not just me. Everyone in town is \nthe same. We're all carrying around \na blackness in our hearts nowadays...'
262822:'It's all Ragou's fault...<PAGE>...But no. The worst thing \nyou can do is try to pin \nblame on someone else...'
262823:'The strange thing in \nthe sky, and that giant \ntower are nothing.<PAGE>At least, nothing compared \nto Ragou's tyranny.'
262824:'Ragou's oppression was \nabsolutely monstrous.<PAGE>Now all anyone can talk about \nis monsters. Have they forgotten \nwhat happened here?'
262825:'That was an enormous thud. \nBut I'm not surprised by \nsomething like this. <PAGE>Nothing gets done \nby being worried. '
262826:'I'd like to thank Ragou for \nproviding me the courage \nto withstand anything. <PAGE>Luckily, he isn't \naround to accept \nmy gratitude. '
262827,272829:'Rhybgaro horns are a vital \nsource of ki...ki...uh, a \nreally important medicine.<PAGE>...That's what the woman doctor \nin glasses with the white wolf \npuppy was saying, anyway.'
262828,272828:'You know the Rhybgaro that \nold official guy was talking \nabout? I know where it is.<PAGE>It's in the forest to the \nsouth. I'm not lying!'
262829:'What, Rhybgaro? You're \nlooking for ways to get \nout of paying taxes, too? <PAGE>I have no idea... \nThat's your problem.'
262830:'You're really relentless. \nGo to the uplands \nsouth of the city. <PAGE>It may be fun being \nkilled by the monsters. '
262831,262835:'No matter how good distribution is and \nhow many products are on the market, \nthere's nothing better than gels.<PAGE>You're tired? Have a gel. \nHungry? Have a gel. These \nthings are the bee's knees!'
262832,262836:'I do wish they made flavors like tofu \nand cod roe, though. How much more \nfulfilling my gel life would be then!'
262833:'There was a lot of commotion \nfrom the alley. I wonder \nwhat was going on. <PAGE>Oh! Forget it! It's nothing really. \nI was just a little curious. '
262834:'I'm just happy with gels. <PAGE>I don't care if a cat is crying \nin the alley or if an assassin \nis carrying out his secret plot♪'
262837:'When we were struggling under \nRagou's yoke and didn't have anything \nto eat, gels saved my life...<PAGE>Thank you, gels! I \nlove you, gels! We'll \nbe friends forever.'
262838:'That was the reason I became such \na big gel aficionado, you know.'
262839:'First Belius from Nordopolica...now \nthe Don from Dahngrest...?<PAGE>What's going to happen to our world? \nMore importantly, what's going to \nhappen to our world's gels?'
262840:'Gels really are like \nan oasis in my heart...no, \nin my body!'
262841:'Hey, this is serious! I heard \nZaphias is in shambles!<PAGE>Zaphias manufactures \nmost of the gels!'
262842:'Does this mean I won't \nbe able to keep on eating \nmy gels...?'
262843:'The shops are still stocked with gels, \nbut who knows when supplies are going to run \nout? It really keeps me up at night...<PAGE>I just can't think about \nanything else right now.'
262844:'Maybe I should buy up all the \ngels left before someone else \ngets their hands on them...'
262845:'People are saying that thing \nin the sky is going to destroy \nthe entire world.<PAGE>That's ridiculous! Let's \ncut it up and eat it!'
262846:'Doesn't the texture of that thing \nin the sky seem so...gel-like?'
262847,272904:'What is that tower? <PAGE>I'm scared, really scared...'
262848:'This may not be the \ntime to be calmly \neating gel. '
262849:'My husband got mad at me, saying \nthis was no time for gels and \nI was too old for them anyway.<PAGE>The shopkeepers won't sell \nthem to me anymore, either.'
262850:'Hmph! I don't really care. \nBottles are the new \nbig thing, anyway.<PAGE>Aren't holy bottles \njust the best?♪'
262851:'Someone went into \nthe alley over there \njust right now. <PAGE>It's dangerous entering a dark \nplace on a rainy day like this. '
262852:'I can't say public safety \nis good here. <PAGE>I don't think you should go into \nany back alleys in this city. '
262853:'What were you doing \nin the back alley? <PAGE>Are you some \ncommon criminal?'
262854:'You... you don't look \nlike someone who \ndoes bad things.'
262855:'When the sky clears \nup like this, my heart \nbecomes heavy. <PAGE>Even without the weather, the \natmosphere has changed and \nit's harder to live in this city...'
262856:'...\n......\n.........<PAGE>What about photosynthesis...? \nI don't know when it's going \nto clear up next.'
262857:'When I was a younger \nman, we didn't have \na magistrate here.<PAGE>I'm trying to remember when \nit was that the Empire's \nadministration got so strict...'
262858:'I don't care how nice the new \nmagistrate is. We're not \nas free as we used to be.'
262859:'I heard Don \nWhitehorse \npassed on.<PAGE>Did you know I took care of him \nonce, when he was just a little \nwhippersnapper? It's true.'

262862:'All the old friends I had here are \nalready dead. I wouldn't have \nany regrets leaving this town.<PAGE>Actually...I don't think I have \nany regrets left at all...'
262863:'There was a town called Duo that sank \ninto the sea before I was even born. \nIt was between Torim and Nor.<PAGE>I certainly never thought I'd get \nto see it rise up out of the ocean. \nLive and learn, they say...'
262864:'What now? You say the thing that rose \nup from the sea isn't Duo at all?<PAGE>What is it, then?'
262865:'The sky has split...so \nmany curious things \nhappening lately.<PAGE>Live and learn.'
262866:'*Sigh*... "Live and learn", indeed...'
262867:'How shocking! A gigantic tower \nsuddenly shooting up from \nout of the mountains?<PAGE>This is the true definition \nof "live and learn"!'
262868:'I wonder what will \nhappen next?<PAGE>Whatever it is, I'm looking forward to it.♪'

262870:'I look out over the dull \nocean from the window \nof the inn every day. <PAGE>I've been traveling under \nsuch discouraging skies \nfor the past half month. '
262871:'The magistrate named Ragou? Absolutely \ndisgraceful. He's brought nothing \nbut shame to the Empire.'
262872:'There aren't many peas in the pod as rotten \nas Ragou was. I'm certain the next \nmagistrate will be much more agreeable.'
262873:'The death of the Don \nwill mean the weakening \nof the Guild Union.<PAGE>Now the Empire, and this town, \nwill be in peace and security.'
262874:'I think this is the ideal \ntime to retake Capua \nTorim by force.<PAGE>However, neither the Council nor the \nKnights seem to have much interest.'

262877:'That young knight named <STR>(FRE) can \ncertainly handle himself, can't he?<PAGE>He may not be of high birth, but it's \nhard to find any other fault with him.'
262878:'Of course, <STR>(FRE) can't hold \na candle to Captain Cumore.<PAGE>I am quite sure he's the \nstrongest knight of all.'
262879:'Whenever will the new \nEmperor be appointed?<PAGE>If only a successor could \nbe decided, it would surely \nhelp to quell this chaos.'
262880:'I would be quite happy with His Royal \nHighness Ioder, or even someone else. \nWe need a new Emperor soon...'
262881:'I was surprised with that \ntower, but it's okay. <PAGE>That's because we \nhave a barrier. '
262882:'As long as we have \nthe Empire and barriers, \nthis world is secure. <PAGE>I feel sorry for lower \nclass citizens who do not \nbelieve in the Empire. '
262883:'Things seem to be quite clamorous \noutside town, but within the barrier, \nit's rather peaceful.<PAGE>Of course, the low-born folk are \npanicking, as is their wont.'

262915:'Finally, the port's been reopened! \nNow we can set sail. First stop, \nCapua Torim.'
262916:'"The ocean is the domain \nof lusty men... Seaways \nthe roads we travel..."'
262917:'The atmosphere here is nice \nenough, but the town itself \nis sort of irritating.<PAGE>This must be the influence \nof that magistrate's rule.'

262925:'I don't know what I could have \ndone, but compared to how scary \nthe ocean is, this is nothing. <PAGE>It's not as if the boat \nis going to overturn. '
262926:'Oh, I'm a man of the sea... I'm \nnot scared of landslides, but \ntidal waves are scary... <PAGE>I stirring up my heart \nby singing...!'
262927:'Have you seen the notice board? \nThere's a new wanted man!<PAGE>It says he has long black \nhair, kind of like you!'
262928:'When I finally thought it would \nclear up, it's now this. <PAGE>This is scary, real scary. There's a lot of \nthings in this world that frighten me. '
262929:'Hmm? There's a reward \nposted for Lord Ragou... <PAGE>"Ex-magistrate Ragou, \nWhereabouts Unknown! Reward For \nInformation: 2000 Gald", it says.'
262930:'Ohh, how frightening. \nDo you think he \nwas kidnapped?'
262931:'This one says, "Don Whitehorse Dead! \nWho Will Be His Successor?"<PAGE>If the relationship between the guilds \nand the Empire gets worse, this town \nwill be the first to feel the effects.'
262932:'Ohh, how frightening. There'll be \na war of succession. It's almost \ntoo frightening to think about!'
262933:'"Giant Insect Blastia \nRampages From East To West!", \nsays this one. <PAGE>I wonder if that \nwas what I saw out \non the sea...?'
262934:'Ohh, how frightening. Just think about how \nutterly squashed you'd be if something \nlike that stepped on you. How terrible!'
262935:'There were people shouting, \n"Martial Law in Zaphias! \nCitizens Flee to Capua." <PAGE>I have no idea what \nthey're talking about.'
262936:'Ohh, how frightening. Just think about \nhow many scary people there are \nout there. It's simply horrible!'
262937:'"Ancient Relic Of The Past?! \nA Giant Palace Appears In The \nInland Sea!", this one reads.<PAGE>Do you think the ancients \nlived beneath the sea...?'
262938:'Ohh, how frightening. I hope they don't \ndiscover a bunch of dead bodies there. \nNothing could be scarier than that!'
262939:'What was that sound? \nI'm worried. <PAGE>I wish they would post news on \nthe bulletin board quicker...'
262940:'I'm always here \nwaiting for the \nlatest news. <PAGE>I'm all a-twitter...'
262941:'"The Monster In The \nSky: Angel Or Demon?!", \nit says.<PAGE>How could that thing possibly \nlook like an angel to anybody?!'
262942:'Ohh, how frightening. I'm starting \nto think there isn't anything in \nthis world that ISN'T scary!'
262943:'Clear skies are \nthe best♪ <PAGE>A bright sun and blue ocean \nare a match for this city!'
262944:'Welcome, welcome! City of the \nsurf and sun. City of the blue \nocean and ship's horn. <PAGE>This is Capua \nNor.'
262945,272802:'Originally, this was one city \nmade up of Nor, Torim, and \nDuo, built on the ocean.<PAGE>I suppose it's been more than \na hundred years since Duo \nsank to the bottom of the sea...'
262946,272803:'You can probably see \nit from the piers.<PAGE>See what? The bridge that once \nconnected Capua, Torim and Duo.'
262947,272804:'This town owes its prosperity to the \nregular liners and trading ships.<PAGE>Of course, Ragou's control was \nmore than enough to strip this \ntown of all its vitality.'
262948,272805:'Once a town loses its vitality, I'd wager it's \nan almost impossible task to get it back.'
262949:'The capital's in an \nuproar and people are \nleaving in droves.<PAGE>Some are crossing over Ehmead \nHill and coming here.'
262950:'First, the chaos in the \ncapital, now an explosion \non Ehmead Hill. <PAGE>I heard some people were \ncaught in that explosion.'
262951:'I heard they somehow repaired the barrier \nback in Zaphias, but I'm sure they're \nnot taking any chances. <PAGE>We can't, either. We have \nto prepare our town for anything \nthat might happen...'
262952:'It seems researchers come from \nAspio now and again to perform \nmaintenance on our blastia. <PAGE>Even so, it's pure foolish \nto have blind faith that \neverything will be all right.'
262953:'There have been a lot of small temblors \nlately. It's strange... The land \nhere is historically very stable.'
262954:'We can't ignore these earthquakes any \nlonger. Might they have something to \ndo with the monster in the sky...?'
262955:'Aspio was right beneath where that \ntower sprang up. If I had to guess, \nI'd say it was razed to the ground.<PAGE>Who's going to do our \nblastia maintenance now...?'
262956:'At any rate, it certainly was huge. \nI wouldn't be surprised if the entire \ncontinent of Ilyccia sank...'
262957:'Hey. You didn't find \nany Rhybgaros? <PAGE>Wait, you did? Then \nwhere are they?'
262958:'Don't lie. You \ndidn't find any. '
262959:'Have you seen the new magistrate \nyet? He's a young man with fair \nskin, and he seems really kind.<PAGE>Of course, I thought the old magistrate \nseemed like a nice old man \nwhen I first saw him, too.'
262960:'Absolute power \ncorrupts absolutely.<PAGE>...That's what the knight with \nbristly green hair wearing \na mask was saying, anyway.'
262961,262965:'There are more Rhybgaros \nlike the one brought over \nby the previous magistrate.'
262962,262966:'"If you mix foreign animals \nin an area, this disrupts \nthe local ecosystem."<PAGE>...At least, that's what the \ntied blue-hair, cool, bad-mouthed \nstudent said... '
262963:'I wonder if "aer" has anything \nto do with the freezing \nof the Northern Sea. <PAGE>Do you know whether the \ndrift ice of frozen \nsea water is salty?'
262964:'Our very lives depend on \nthe existence of "aer". \nWe should be thankful.<PAGE>...That's what the pink-haired, \nKritya-looking girl carrying \na broom said, anyway.'
262967,272838:'Everyone's talking about the end \nof the world lately, but...<PAGE>...Just look at how big the \nworld is! Do you think it's \nreally going to end so fast?'
262968:'Even if the world should be coming\nto an end, we can still fight as long\nas we never lose hope.<PAGE>That's what the guy with spiky\nblonde hair who was calling himself\na hero was saying, anyway.'
262969:'I'm surprised!\nI didn't think that a tower\nwould come out from there.<PAGE>I wonder who made that.'
262970:'How could I be scared? It's an \nancient mystery and something \nthat looks like a daffodil. <PAGE>That's what the silver-haired, \nloud-mouthed, female \nteacher said. '
262971:'Have you gone and climbed the tower that \ncame out of the northern mountains yet?<PAGE>It looks like it's made from \na whole bunch of other buildings \nstanding together.'
262972:'I think the ancient city only looks like \na tower from a distance because of how \nthe buildings stand close together.<PAGE>...That's what the cool swordsman \nwearing a bone on his head \nwas saying, anyway.'
262973:'I hate rain. However, \nI hate clear skies \neven more. <PAGE>It's so pretty and smells \nof lies that it makes \nme want to vomit. '
262974:'Although there are people who complain \nto the magistrate, it's their \nfault for not having any money.'
262975:'Barbos from the mercenary \nguild and Ragou from the \nEmpire were the same. <PAGE>People with power do whatever they \nwant, and then they die. Trying to \nlive an honest life is pointless.'
262976:'Course, I'll never become like \neither of those guys no matter \nhow much I might struggle.'
262977:'I tell you... This is one mean world... \nHeh, I guess that's not much of \na welcome. Anyway, wanna stay?<PAGE>It's 300 Gald a night.'

263003:'A golden light moving at high \nspeed in the south forest must \nbe someone's delusion. '

263012:'I think the magistrate, Ragou, \nmet with great misfortune.<PAGE>He was only collecting monsters to practice \nthose elegant hobbies of his.<PAGE>They may have been eccentric hobbies, but \nhe was only exercising his special privileges. \nDon't you think that's charmingly grandiose?'

263355,273304:'I thought it had \ninformation on the Euma......<PAGE>What? There's nothing? \n......What a crock!'
263356,265469,273305:'There are definitely Eumas \nroaming this world!<PAGE>I will find one, and \nthen we'll see who'll \nhave the last laugh!'
263357:'Euma is one of them!'
263358,263360:'That's it! Verily, \nthe legendary Euma!'
263359,263361,265472:'Did you see it?! \nAll you fools that \nlaughed at me!'
263362,263364:'Aaaargh! My granddaughter, that little \nhellion! She took my boat out \non the ocean without asking...<PAGE>...and now the engine's \nbusted! She's going to get \na piece of my mind...'
263363,263365:'How could I possibly have \nraised a girl who loves \nthe sea so much?!'
263366:'Aifread brought the Don \nand Belius together. That's \nhow they became friends.<PAGE>They really respected \nhim for that......'
263367:'Now there's no Don, \nno Belius, no Aifread... ...<PAGE>Ahhh... the grim reaper \nwill be coming for these \nold bones soon enough...'
263368,263370,265481,265483:'My granddaughter never understands how \ndangerous the sea can be, no matter \nhow many times I explain it to her.'
263369,263371,265482,265484:'I have a feeling she won't \nget it until the sea \neventually kills her.'
263372:'My fool granddaughter's out on \nthe sea again, even though that \nfearsome thing's in the sky.'
263373:'I can't believe how stubborn she is! She certainly \ndoesn't take after anyone in our family.'
263374,265487:'I wash my hands of her... \nAn old man can't overcome \nthe passion of youth.<PAGE>She can do whatever she wants...'
263375,265486:'I can't believe how stubborn \nshe is! She certainly doesn't \ntake after anyone in our family.'
263376,263378:'My senile old gramps forgot \nthe promise he made to \nlet me have his boat!<PAGE>Look, he gave it to me. \nI can do whatever I \nwant with it, right?!'
263377:'I mean, he's the reason \nI love the ocean \nso much anyway...'
263379:'I mean, it's his fault \nI love the ocean \nso much anyway...'
263380,265493:'The Don in the north, Belius in \nthe south, and the Pirate King, \nAifread, on the seas.<PAGE>Now all of them \nare gone...'
263381,263383,263385,265496:'I don't care how dangerous \nit is. I have to do \nwhat I have to do.'
263382:'"The sea is dangerous", yeah, \nyeah, I know that much!'
263384:'My gramps went to \nsea years ago.<PAGE>Why can't I have \nthe same freedom...?'
263386:'Why do I go out on the ocean \neven though gramps doesn't  \napprove? To achieve his dreams. <PAGE>I'm going to achieve the \ndreams he had when \nhe was a sailor.'
263387,263389:'I'm going to achieve \nthe dreams he had when \nhe was a sailor.'
263388:'No matter how great the danger \nin the sky, I will get out on the sea! <PAGE>I will face up to the danger \njust like a true king of the pirates!'
263390,263392:'My father and my daughter \nare so quick to argue.<PAGE>I wish they'd just get along...they're \nso alike, those two.'
263391,263393,265504,265506:'It's not as if they \nreally dislike each \nother, you know.'
263394,263398,265509,265511:'If only they would talk to each \nother... But they're both so stubborn. \nThey're always fighting.'
263395:'My daughter and father\nhasn't themselves lately.<PAGE>I wonder if it has anything\nto do with the death of\nthe Don and Belius?'
263396:'Honestly, I don't care much\nfor the Don nor Belius.'
263397,263399:'They're just too embarassed to sit \ndown and have a face-to-face.'
263400,263402,265513,265515:'With things as they are, \nI'm worried about my daughter \nsailing as well...'
263401,263403:'Not that she's the kind of girl who'd \never listen to what I had to say.'
263404:'Well well, hello again. We met \nat Deidon Hold, didn't we?<PAGE>Have you finally decided \nto work for us?'
263405,265518:'After we met, the Hold was reopened \nand I was able to get back to town.<PAGE>If it had been even a little later, \nI wouldn't have been able to cross \nthe sea because of the storms.'

263408:'You never realize how important \nsomeone is until they're \ngone, do you?'
263409,265522,274872:'Now I understand just how hard it'll be \nto fill the hole the Don left behind.'
263410,265523:'Well, then...it's time for Fortune's \nMarket to act like Fortune's \nMarket, and earn big!'
263411,265524:'You can't move forward \nif you keep thinking about \npeople lost forever.'
263412:'The Empire's in a panic right now. \nIf we trade smart during the \naftermath, it'll mean huge profit.'
263413:'The Knights or His Royal Highness...\nWhich is the more valuable property? \nI'm considering what to invest in...'
263414:'With so many strange goings on, it's not \nexactly easy doing business lately.'
263415,263417,265528:'We've sent relief supplies here and \nthere, so we've taken a huge loss.<PAGE>We're going to work together \nto make that money \nback. All right?'
263416:'When did we \nbecome a charity \nguild? <PAGE>We've taken huge losses \nsending relief supplies \nfor free...'
263418,263420:'This is Fortune's Market \nheadquarters.<PAGE>The President is very \nbusy. Don't bother her.'
263419,263421:'This is Fortune's Market \nheadquarters.<PAGE>Stay away from the President. \nYou'll only be a bother.'
263422:'The Don's death has had \nquite an effect on Fortune's \nMarket, too.'
263423,263424:'The president is even busier \nthan usual. Don't bother her.'
263425:'The president is hard at work \nagain today. Don't bother her.'
263426,265539:'Weapons are power, but so are distribution \nand finance. Fortune's Market has \nthe power to change the world.'
263427:'The president is in a good mood today. But \nthat doesn't mean you can go bother her.'
263428,263430:'She may be the president, but \nshe helps people out. That's \nwhat makes her so wonderful.'
263429,263431:'She isn't the kind of person that \nwould demand payback once the \ndust had settled, either.'
263432,263434:'...This town is so \nnice to live in...<PAGE>The people are kind, the weather not \ntoo hot, not too cold...and best \nof all...the President is here...'
263433,263435:'...This will be our little secret, but...<PAGE>...The president \nsmells so nice...'
263436,263438,263440,263442:'I stand at the President's side again today. \nThere could be not greater happiness.'
263437,265550:'...This will be our little secret, but...<PAGE>...The President's clothes make \nher look slimmer than she is.'
263439:'...This will be our little secret, but...<PAGE>...The President really, really \nhates being called "ma'am".'
263441:'...This will be our little secret, but...<PAGE>...The President loves money.'
263443,265556:'...This will be our little secret, but...<PAGE>...The President has no \nintention of every marrying.'
263444,265557:'President and Chief are \njust different titles. \nThey're both bosses.<PAGE>We're proud of the title.'
263445,265558:'...This will be our little secret, but...<PAGE>...The President never \ntakes off her glasses.'
263446,263448,263450,263452,263454:'This facility is under direct control \nof the Empire. If you don't have \nbusiness here, please move along.'

263456,263458,263460,263462,263464:'This is Aspio, the closed \ncity of learning.<PAGE>Please produce your passport.'
263457:'It's unusual for outsiders \nto come to Aspio.<PAGE>All anyone here cares \nabout is research.<PAGE>Everyone here is such a loony, \njust standing guard makes me \nthink I might lose it myself.'
263459:'Everyone here is still such a loony, just \nstanding guard makes me think I might lose \nit myself. You folk be careful, too.'
263461:'My colleague beside me here is so devoted \nto his duties, but sometimes you \njust want to take a breather.'
263463:'The skies over in the direction \nof Zaphias look so strange.<PAGE>I wonder if everything's all right?'
263465:'We haven't received any \norders from Zaphias... What's \nhappened to the Knights?'
263467,263469:'Ooh, leave me be! How am I supposed \nto conduct my research with all \nof you loitering about? Go away!'
263471:'Ooh, can't you leave me alone?! \nJust a little bit more...just...don't \ntalk to me! I can't think!'
263473:'Ooh, can't you just leave me alone?! \nWhat do you need now?! This \nis the most important step!!'
263475:'I've got it! I've got the \nformula! I did it!! ...Wha, \nwho are you people?<PAGE>...What? Why is \nit so dark? Did \nsomething happen?'
263476:'Who the hell are you?! \nYou try and swipe any \nblastia, I'll know!'
263477:'How? Well, we're the blastia administration \ndepartment. Administering all the \nexcavated blastia is our job.'
263478:'Hey, you people...you just let yourselves \ninto the ruins, didn't you? We can't have \nthat. Laypeople aren't allowed in there.'
263479:'You know, the rights to those ruins \nused to be ours...damn it all! Always \ngetting beat out by Mordio...'
263480:'The blastia thief was caught, right? \nAnd Mordio's gone...now it's all down \nto the research results...heh heh!♪'
263481:'Now we just have to get the results \ntogether and announce them...'
263482,263483:'The sky's looking strange?<PAGE>You can't even see the \nsky here. Who cares?'
263484,263485:'It's dangerous? What \nare you saying?<PAGE>The blastia we're excavating are even \nmore energized than usual. This \nis our chance at experimentation!'
263486:'They say we're going to have some Guild \nhelp out with excavation at the ruins...?'
263487:'"Ruins' Gate", or something...they'll \njust get in \nthe way...'
263488,263489:'Did something happen \non Ehmead Hill?<PAGE>One of my colleagues went there \nwith several other people...'
263490,263494:'Now the Knights have \ncome and taken several \nresearchers with them.<PAGE>They took blastia, too, saying \nit was for the development \nof...Hera...? Hera-something.'
263491,263495:'The Knights just do whatever they want. \nOur research is going to be delayed...and \nwithout <STR>(RIT) here, now's our chance!'
263492:'The sky above Zaphias is looking \nunusual, they say?<PAGE>Maybe something happened with \ntheir barrier blastia...'
263493:'If you want to talk to Tort, \nyou have to bring a Krityan. <PAGE>Oh, you have one in your group, \ndon't you? Why don't you have them \ncome up here and talk to him?'
263496:'Who are you? \nI haven't seen you anywhere. <PAGE>Well, it doesn't matter though...'
263497:'You're not wearing blastia \nclothes... You must be an \nofficer of the empire. <PAGE>You don't look like an officer at all.... \nWell, it doesn't matter though....'
263498:'It's pretty unusual for Mordio \nto work with other people.'
263500,263501:'The Tree of Halure withering and \nblooming again is simply \nnatural providence.'
263502,263503:'The operating rate of our blastia has been \nvery high lately. Aer control is going well, \nand research is proceeding smoothly.'
263504,263505:'The abnormal environment in Zaphias \nright now...might it have something \nto do with an aer abnormality?'
263506:'Damn it all...thanks to all the \nearthquakes lately, our excavation \nsite has been closed down.'
263507:'I know there's something just beyond... \nBut there's nothing I can do about it now. \nI suppose I'll straighten out all the data....'
263508:'Hmm...? The stock list \nand number of blastia \ndoesn't match...'
263509:'Just my mistake? \nI've been so forgetful \nlately...'
263510:'You people have \nMordio with you? \nHow unusual.'
263511:'Going off blastia-hunting again, eh?'
263512:'Without Mordio around, our research \nis going to fall behind.'
263513:'How soon will her business \nwith you people end?<PAGE>I'd really like to have her \nhelp with research here...'
263514:'You, guys have something \nnice. It's a S P E C I A L Flag! <PAGE>Something special will \nhappen if you use it.'
263515:'When I say special, \nI mean special. <PAGE>It is miracle. <PAGE>Well, you'll understand after reading \nthe explanation and actually using it.'
263516:'Would you like a rest for 100 Gald? \nIt's just a bookshelf, of course.'
263517,264507,273444,273447,273450,273453,273456:'Will you stay?'
263518,263521,263524,263527,263530:'Would you like a rest for 200 Gald? \nIt's just a bookshelf, of course.'
263520,263523,263526,263529,263532:'We're all used to sleeping on bookcases, \nbut it might be a little rough for \nfirst-timers. Do come again.'
263533:'The blastia excavated here \nwere all made by the Kritya \nlong, long ago.'
263534:'I'd love to be able to discuss \nblastia architecture with a \nKritya engineer some day...'
263535:'Halure? Oh, the town with the barrier \nthat serves as the best representative \nexample of blastia with organic properties?<PAGE>What about it?'
263536:'I really never leave the town, \nso I'm not very well-informed.<PAGE>Not that I particularly want to be.'
263537:'You know, all the blastia we \nexcavate here were physically \nburied by Kritya hands.<PAGE>What do you think it means?'
263538:'Please don't bother me right \nnow. I'm thinking very \nhard about blastia.'
263539:'Why would they bury \nso many blastia...? \nHmm... Hmmmm...<PAGE>...Because they couldn't \nbe used anymore...?\n...No, certainly not...'
263540:'They purposely stopped using such \nconvenient things...things that \nmake life so easy, right?'
263541:'Why? My calculations makes \nno sense! The recent \ndata is so bizarre!!<PAGE>This data is important. \nIt means something!!'
263542:'Incredible! These results completely \nexplode the commonly accepted theories! \nAbsolutely incredible!!'
263543:'Ruins... \nMust investigate ruins...<PAGE>Whoa! I dozed off there...'
263544:'I hear looters broke into \nthe ruins to the southeast.<PAGE>They've already been \nthoroughly explored...I \ndoubt there's anything left.'
263545:'If Halure's blastia evolves \nby adopting organic traits...<PAGE>Would it be possible to force evolution \nin humans through the use of blastia...?'
263546:'Would you mind not bothering me right \nnow? I'm trying to think about the \nhuman bodies and organic traits.'
263547:'Your bodhi blastia has \nan interesting color. <PAGE>You must use your bodhi \nblastia quite a bit since \nit has grown so much.'
263548:'You guys...\nYou're the blastiaaaah.....<PAGE>...*Snore*...\nWhoa! I fell asleep.... My night \nand day are all mixed up.'
263549:'Ahhh, ..... I am sleepy..... \nOhhh, ..... I was asleep..... <PAGE>Is it still daytime? \nI can't tell if it's day or night \nsince it is so dark outside...'
263550:'I've heard the skies over Zaphias are rather \nunusual. I'd like to go investigate...perhaps \nwhen my research comes to a stopping point.'
263551:'I think the recent earthquake \nexposed the blastia \non the mountain. <PAGE>That earthquake is clearly \nthe reason I can't sleep.'
263552:'No, wait. If you look at it a different \nway...maybe it's the blastia causing \nthe earthquakes? That can't be...'
263553,263556,263559,263562,263565:'Many thanks! Fortune's Market, always \nbringing you what you need...when you \nneed it...at the price that's right!'
263555:'...Or so I'd like to say, but \nthe Empire's closed us down \nand there's no way in.<PAGE>*Sniff*'
263558:'...Or so I'd like to say, but with business \nruined we aren't really able to stock \na very wide variety of products...<PAGE>*Sniff*'
263561,263564:'Our business is still in \na shambles, you know...<PAGE>*Sniff*'
263567:'There have been so many earthquakes \nlately...do you think they're a precursor \nto something worse?'
263568:'At Ruins' Gate we specialize \nin excavation of ruins.<PAGE>It may seem humble, but we \ntake pride in our work.'
263569:'Through excavation, we seek \nout our world's past.'
263570:'Yesterday digging, today more digging... \nIt may not look it, but fooling \naround in the dirt is fun.<PAGE>Nothing in the world beats the \nfeeling you get when you unearth \nan impressive artifact.'
263571:'We don't cry even if \nwe run into worms!'
263572:'Have you gone there? To the \nsouth side slope on the hill \nin front of this town? <PAGE>It was blocked by a boulder \nand we moved it. '
263573:'Our job actually isn't \njust excavating ruins. <PAGE>The recovery of the south side slope on \nthe hill was a real desire of the mages who \ntravel between the capital and Aspio. '
263574:'The mountain collapsed from the \nimpact on the capital and blocked \nthe road to Shaikos. <PAGE>Then, it was \nour turn! '
263575:'Anyway, I wonder what \nthat shock wave was? <PAGE>Well, that's OK. \nI am happy just \nswinging a pickax. '
263576:'There's something like a giant \nshadow on the sky itself...it \nseems so sinister.<PAGE>We're merely travelers moving \nfrom ruin to ruin, but it must \nbe hard on the mages here.'
263577:'In any case...maybe we'll go excavating \nat the world's end. No, I don't \nmean we're running away!'
263578:'Our chief is very warm, \nand even treats underlings \nlike us with kindness.<PAGE>He really is the model of \na perfect Guild chief.'
263579:'The only flaw you might mention is the \nfact that he's somewhat cowardly...'
263580:'Our chief is named Regaey. He's \na very mature individual.<PAGE>The reason we're considered one \nof the Five Master Guilds is \nall due to his achievements.'
263581:'If only he could be just \na bit more brave...'
263582:'How many years has it been since Regaey \nassumed leadership of Ruins' Gate...?<PAGE>He may not look it, but he's very shrewd... \nHe's so good at finding blastia, they used \nto say he worked with the hands of a god.'
263583:'Our chief doesn't actually like to \nmake trips to ruins. He must not be \nvery fond of all the monsters...'
263584:'I can't believe Lord Regaey was actually \nYeager from Leviathan's Claw...<PAGE>No, I won't believe it! Yeager \nmust have just been masquerading \nas Lord Regaey!'
263585:'But would that mean...we were just \nunderlings for Leviathan's Claw...?'
263586:'Greetings. Is this your \nfirst time in Nordopolica, \ncity of the coliseum?<PAGE>The coliseum is just up the \nstairs, to your north.∀'
263587:'If you'd like to leave \ntown, just continue \non to your left.<PAGE>I can't imagine anyone \nactually wanting to \nleave, of course.'
263588:'Good day, and welcome \nto Nordopolica!<PAGE>Are you here to participate in a tournament? \nJust spectators? The shopping here is \nreally quite wonderful, you know!♪'
263589:'If you follow the road to the west, \nyou'll arrive at a giant mountain. \nThere's no way across it.<PAGE>Really, there's no point \nin leaving town at all.'
263590:'Good day. This \nis Nordopolica.<PAGE>Things seem to be unpleasant lately, \nbut you can relax and make \nyourself feel at home here.'

263621,273668:'They say the stones of the duelling grounds have \nbeen wet with blood since the day they were set \ndown. Isn't that a lurid way of putting it?'
263622,273669:'Apparently, this city is governed by \nthe descendants of an ancient clan.<PAGE>Only the top-ranking members \nof Palestralle, who rule the \ncity, can ever meet them.'
263623,273670:'I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't \nlike to meet them...but they're just \npeople like you and me, right?'
263624,273671:'I hear very important Empire \nfolk come to watch the \ntournaments sometimes.<PAGE>Of course, this town isn't even \nacknowledged by the Empire, so \nthey must be coming in secret.'
263625,273672:'You never know...the person you're \nsitting next to in the coliseum \nmight actually be a princess.'
263626,273673:'The Empire couldn't destroy this \ntown even if they wanted to.<PAGE>Why not? It's simple. The big names \nfrom the Empire come here to \nhave fun like everyone else.'
263627,273674:'In fact, I bet they'd like to snatch \nthis city away from Palestralle \nand run it under their auspices.'
263628:'You can see some giant shadow \nof a monster in the sky, but we're \nprotected by the barrier.<PAGE>You know those huge pillars \nsurrounding the city? Those are \nNordopolica's barrier blastia.'
263629,273676:'Apparently, most of the citizens \ndon't even know that those \nare their barrier blastia.'
263630:'Entrance by sea \nis the only way \ninto this city.<PAGE>I'm sure there will be ships full \nof refugees from Ilyccia sailing \ninto port any day now.'
263631:'This town's going to get \na whole lot livelier.<PAGE>Maybe it's time \nfor me to be moving \non myself...'
263632:'Yo! You kids come \nto see some hard-core \naction?<PAGE>The spectator tickets \nare platinum! Good \nluck getting some.'
263633:'Huh? Don't tell me you're \nhere to compete.<PAGE>Look at your willowy little body! You \nwouldn't even last a single round.'
263634:'Fighting again? \nDon’t they ever get tired of it?<PAGE>Fighting is just a \npart of daily life.'
263635:'In this town, \nfighting is just \nlike saying “Hi!”.<PAGE>Tourists just \ncan’t understand it!'
263636:'They say the crowd went wild when \nthe reigning champion went head-to-head \nwith some upstart challenger!<PAGE>Man alive, how \nI regret not going \nto see that!'
263637:'What? YOU were the challenger? \nThat's a pretty poor \nattempt at a joke.'
263638:'*Grumble-grumble*...don't \ntalk to me...<PAGE>The coliseum is closed and I'm \ndealing with a lot of stress right \nnow...*grumble-grumble*...'
263639:'Blast it all. Monsters escaped \nand it was a big to-do...*grumble-grumble*...'
263640,273683:'The Duce was killed? No way \nPalestralle is going to \nstay quiet on this one.<PAGE>It's going to be all-out war. \nWhat a sight that'll be...'
263641:'So, who's the killer, anyway? \nI wonder who the all-out \nwar will be with.'
263642:'Hmph. The Knights are \nso stern and gloomy.<PAGE>They'd do well to take a load off \nand watch some fights, you know?'
263643:'Aaargh, the Knights are so annoying! \nCan you tell me why they're \nso damned annoying?'
263644:'The monster in the \nsky? No big deal!<PAGE>You get all the Nordopolican \ntoughs together, there isn't \nanything they can't beat.'
263645:'You hear me, monster?! \nGet down here and let's \nhave us a fight!!'
263646:'First it was a flying monster, \nnow it's some strange tower? \nOver in Aspio, was it?<PAGE>I hear that tower's almost \nlike a monster itself.'
263647:'Why's it always cheap tricks like \nthis, huh? You want a fight, come \nout and fight like a man!'
263648:'Come, come! Don't you want to \nhear the unerring predictions \nof Itoken, master tipster?<PAGE>You pay attention to my tips, \nyou win big! No doubt about it!'
263649:'Coliseum mascot Itoken won't \nlet you down! Just pay \nattention, you hear?<PAGE>In the next bout, Thea's \nthe one to watch.'
263650:'Hey, you! Sonny! You've got \nnothing to lose lending an \near to Itoken the tipster!<PAGE>If Itoken's supernatural prognostication \nskills fail, you get back \nyour every last Gald!'
263651:'You bend your knee to the brilliant Itoken, \nyou're going to win. I guarantee it!<PAGE>Come on now, place your \nbets! Place your bets!'
263652:'It's the fabulous Itoken, he of \nthe endless stream of victories!<PAGE>I haven't lost a bet since the \nday I was born! Come on and listen \nto what Itoken has to say!'
263653:'Inspiration's there for Itoken in a \nflash! He always has the answer! Come \non, what have you got to lose?'
263654:'Itoken's brushed aside every adversity you \ncan imagine! Itoken, fountain of luck, master \ntipster! You've got nothing to lose!<PAGE>Come on, have a listen, \nhave a listen!'
263655:'Want to win? Listen to me! Lost already? \nSeriously consider listening to me!<PAGE>Show a little courage and listen \nto what Itoken has to say!'
263656:'Itoken may not be a great \nfighter, but his luck \nis second to none!<PAGE>Master tipster Itoken, in perfect \nform today, tomorrow, forever!'
263657:'Knights! Guildsmen! \nListen to Itoken, he \nwon't let you down!'
263658:'Itoken's there for you, rain \nor shine! It's always high \ntide on the Itoken Sea!<PAGE>Trust in Itoken's brilliance \nand bet with confidence! \nCome on, come on!'
263659:'No matter what happens, \nyou'll never lose! Believe \nin Itoken's genius!'
263660:'The world may come to an end \nbut somebody's gonna survive!<PAGE>Come on and listen to what luckmaster \nItoken has to say!'
263661:'Itoken has no intention of losing \nyet! Come on and bet your life \nsavings on Master Itoken!'
263662:'Seeing this older gentleman listening so \nintently makes me wonder...maybe this tipster's \ninformation really does pay off?<PAGE>I've never paid much attention \nto tipsters before. Should I \ntry buying some information?'
263663:'When you think about it, \nwhy do tipsters even solicit \ntheir predictions?<PAGE>If they're so confident in their \ninformation, why not keep it a secret \nand place bets themselves?'
263664:'Suddenly a fight broke out! \nI was so surprised.<PAGE>I'm sure it was over something stupid...\n“I like grilled meat!” \n“Well I like fried meat! Take that!” bah...'
263665:'They fight for any little reason...\nThey shouldn’t fight \nover such stupid things.'
263666:'Hmm...hmm. I see. I thought this tipster \nmight have just been spouting his mouth \noff, but he's definitely talking sense.<PAGE>This could work...maybe \nI'll buy a tip \nafter all.'
263667:'My first impression of this fellow was \nthat he was a muscle-bound dolt, but \nhe's actually quite the intellectual.<PAGE>You really cannot judge \npeople by their looks.'
263668:'Listen! I followed this tipster's \ninformation and won two \nhundred thousand Gald!<PAGE>Itoken, I'm so glad \nI trusted you!'
263669:'Next I'm going to bet five hundred \nthousand on a real dark horse!<PAGE>Go, go!!'
263670:'It's so uncomfortable with the \nKnights around. I always feel \nlike I'm being watched.<PAGE>Is it even safe \nto be placing \nbets here?'
263671:'We won't be...caught, \nwill we?'
263672:'Ohh...woe is me...what? You're asking if \nI'm sad because of the Duce's death?<PAGE>No! I'm sad because I'm \nout fifty thousand Gald!'
263673:'Ohh...woe \nis me...'
263674:'Ooh...I'm going to dig out the two million \nGald I have in my purse and bet it \nall! I'm winning my money back!<PAGE>Itoken! Let me hear \nyour predictions!'
263675:'The sky? I don't have any time to think \nabout it! My life is on the line, here!'
263676:'I lost...I lost...what's \nwrong with this \ntipster?<PAGE>I...I haven't been \ncheated, have I?'
263677:'I suppose I should be thankful \nI still have my life...'
263678:'This tipster here, Itoken...he once \npicked a dark horse that won against \nhundred thousand-to-one odds.<PAGE>I reckoned I didn't have anything to \nlose, so I followed his tip. I never \nimagined it would pay out so well.'
263679:'That bet netted me an almost \nunthinkable amount of Gald. \nIt was like paradise...<PAGE>Yet ever since then, neither Itoken \nnor I have picked any winners. Now all \nI have left to my name is debt...'
263680:'Itoken has quite the silver tongue. He \nmanages to convince himself his predictions \nare sound even when they fail.<PAGE>I must be a generous man...I \nfall for his smart talk \nagain and again.'
263681:'This noble lady beside me is \nplacing quite a large bet...perhaps \nI will as well.<PAGE>How lucky I'd be if this paid off \nand I was able to get out of debt.'
263682:'Itoken fingered a dark horse worth \nfive hundred thousand...!<PAGE>What an old fool I am! Why \nnow, of all times, did I decide \nto get cold feet...'
263683:'The noble lady beside \nme won big...<PAGE>Surely she could spare \na few Gald now...'
263684:'Itoken's tips never \npan out, do they?<PAGE>It's incredible he's able to stay \nin business with nothing but talk.'
263685:'Why do I even keep \non buying Itoken's \ntips...?'
263686:'What a dupe...this noble lady \njust bet her entire fortune \non one of Itoken's tips.<PAGE>I suppose that's just the pot \ncalling the kettle black...'
263687:'Poor Belius has died...this \nis no time to \nbe gambling...<PAGE>But I can't stop. \nIt's an addiction.'
263688:'He's never right...this so-called tipster \nis nothing but a clump of bad luck.<PAGE>Even so, his business is booming. \nHow nice it must be to be ignorant.'
263689:'Hey...when you think about it, he's \nnot losing a single Gald, is he?<PAGE>His tips aren't worth a whit and he \nkeeps on squeezing money out of us!'
263690:'I don't know how much longer I have left \nto live. If I can just win one more \nbet, have one final good memory...<PAGE>But still, I lose. Does \nthis cruel tipster even \ncare about my feelings?'
263691:'The end is nigh...if we're all going \nto be destroyed anyway, perhaps \nbankruptcy isn't so bad...'
263692:'This is my first time at the coliseum. \nEverything was so shocking, and \nI got a bit too excited...<PAGE>Now I'm just taking in a little \nsea breeze to calm myself down.'
263693:'Whew...my heart is still \npounding. Here, touch \nmy chest and see.<PAGE>Hey, I'm just kidding, \nyou know.♪'
263694:'That's the Coliseum City \nfor you! I can see \nfights every day! <PAGE>It's wonderful! \nJust wonderful!'
263695,273736:'Can I see a bit \nmore blood...?<PAGE>I lied, \nI’m just kidding!'
263696,273737:'What’s happened!? \nAn old man wearing explorer’s \nclothes ran out of the town.<PAGE>What’s that!? Trouble you say? \nAh, I’m so excited! '
263697,273738:'Great, that’s what I love about this town!<PAGE>There’s cheating everyday...<PAGE>Ahhh, I mean...Picking?...\nnot learning...\nhiking...?'
263698:'The crowd was going crazy a \nlittle while ago. You could \neven hear screams of pain.<PAGE>I wish I had been there to see \nit. The louder the screams, \nthe more exciting it is...'
263699:'Bloody flesh...blackened bones...shredded \nskin...scattered entrails...it's \nall so thrilling.<PAGE>Hey, I'm just kidding! I sure \nhave a sick mind, huh?♪'
263700:'All the matches are so boring \nlately. It's always the \nsame old fighters.<PAGE>You're already here in \nNordopolica. How about \nyou step in the ring?'
263701:'Of course, you'll just lose \nand die a dog's death.<PAGE>Tee-hee, I'm just kidding! \nWhat a big mouth I have.♪'
263702:'If they're going to have such big, \nexciting matches, why don't they \nadvertise them beforehand?<PAGE>They just held an event with people against \ngiant monsters. And it was a walk-in!'
263703:'Look, we came all the way here. \nThat's the kind of ridiculous \nthing we want to see, right?'
263704,273759:'Ooh, I just had a great idea. \nWhy not pit knights against \nguildsmen in the coliseum?<PAGE>Now, wouldn't that be exciting?∀'
263705:'Howls of anguish! Brother against brother! \nShowers of blood! The mad roar of \nthe crowd... Oh, how wonderful!<PAGE>I'm kidding! \nI'm kidding!♪'
263706:'Say, that monster in \nthe sky...what is it?<PAGE>It's so new and exciting...even if it \nis the kind of monster that attacks \npeople, I'd love to see it up close...'
263707:'It’s first victim will be little...old...me!∀ \nAh, the martyrdom of a tragic heroine.<PAGE>I'm just kidding. That \nwould be awful!♪'
263708:'The coliseum is a cornucopia \nof thrills and excitement.<PAGE>But, for some reason...it's \njust not enough anymore.'
263709:'The matches in the coliseum just \ndon't satisfy me anymore.<PAGE>Why? What does \nit mean?'
263710:'I'm completely addicted \nto the coliseum's \ncharms.<PAGE>That's why I made up my mind to \nlive here permanently. Now I just \nhave to save up some Gald...'
263711:'I left a husband behind, but \nit doesn't really bother me.<PAGE>The coliseum is more important \nthan a husband.'
263712:'My. oh my...\nWhy do they fight \nhere of all places?<PAGE>If you want to fight, \nget to the coliseum!'
263713:'If they want to fight, \nthey should try beating \nsomeone in the coliseum.<PAGE>Honestly, these bloody-minded \nmen are really a pain!'
263714:'A bearded man \nwith a pale face ran \naway from here.<PAGE>There was a dog chasing him... \nNo, it was more like a monster... \nIs there a monster inside the barrier...?'
263715:'The guy running away, \nand even the dog, \nboth looked terrible!'
263716:'I'm originally \nfrom Zaphias, but \nI moved here.<PAGE>The seaside view and the smell of the \nsea are wonderful, but most importantly \nthis is where the coliseum is.'
263717:'I may have left my husband behind in Zaphias, \nbut he always had more time for his hobbies \nthan he did me. Now we're even.'
263718:'I left my husband in Zaphias to \nbe near the coliseum, but sometimes \nI get a little worried...<PAGE>Is he eating right? Is he \ncleaning up after himself?'
263719:'Of course, I forget all \nabout my husband when \nthe matches begin.'
263720:'Just look at this town. Full \nof warships and knights.<PAGE>I thought this place was so \nunlike Zaphias, but now it isn't \nvery different at all.'
263721:'Even so, it's worth \nit as long as the coliseum \nkeeps running.'
263722:'I was just another immigrant when I first \nmoved here, but now I've really gotten used \nto the place and made a lot of friends.<PAGE>...Just a little joke. No, \nall I care about are the \nmatches in the coliseum.'
263723:'All my cares are washed \naway when the matches \nbegin...'
263724:'What's wrong with the sky? That \nmust be over in Ilyccia.<PAGE>Is Zaphias safe? \nMy husband...'
263725:'I'm not exactly sure why, but I'm worried \nabout my husband in Zaphias...'
263726:'I've decided to return to Zaphias \nfor a little while, and bring \nmy husband back here with me.<PAGE>It's much better \nliving in Nordopolica \nnow, anyway.'
263727:'I love watching the matches alone, \nbut maybe they'll be even more exciting \nwith my husband beside me.'
263728,263730,263736,263737,263738,263739,263740,263741:'These are the docks. If you \nwish to travel by sea, you \nmay depart from here.'
263729,263731:'If you own your own ship, you can \ncome and go whenever you like.♪'
263732,263734:'These are the docks. Passage \non sea routes is currently \nunder regulation.'
263733,263735:'I wouldn't recommend setting \nsail right now.'
263742,263744,263746,263748,263750,263752,263754:'Don't talk to me...'
263743,263745,263747,263749,263751,263753,263755:'Look, you can't just \ncome in here...'
263756:'...\nHo, boy. Would you \nlisten to the ramblings \nof an old woman?<PAGE>Nobody believes me, but \nI saw it...I saw it clearly \nwith my own two eyes.'
263757:'What did I see, you ask? \nA monster. A monster!<PAGE>I mistakenly stepped into the pathway, \nand saw the very moment it changed shape \nfrom human to beast...*shiver*...'
263758,273795:'Did the coliseum \nmonster escape...?<PAGE>It’s gone?! \nThe monster that looks \nlike a big fox...'
263759,273796:'I’ve seen that monster before... \nMan, if that thing goes off on one, \nit’s gonna get real serious real quick.'
263760:'That monster I saw awhile ago at the back \nof the coliseum...what could it have been?<PAGE>It was certainly fearsome, but there \nwas something almost celestial about \nit that gave me goosebumps...'
263761:'Perhaps it was a guardian \ndeity that protects \nour city...?'
263762:'There's something disquieting \nin the air recently...<PAGE>I suppose you'd call it sixth sense. \nI just have a feeling something \nawful is going to happen...'
263763:'O guardian deity, please \nprotect your city \nand its citizens...'
263764:'Our guardian deity...the \nmonster...it was killed.<PAGE>Guildsmen from the \nUnion did it. What \nbarbarians...'
263765:'If that really was \nour guardian, this \ncity is finished.'
263766,273817:'They say it was the \nguardian deity that \nkilled Duce Belius. <PAGE>I suppose it wasn't our \nguardian at all...just \na common monster.'
263767:'How pitiful to be without a guardian \ndeity, without Duce Belius...and \nprotected by the Knights.'
263768:'Lord Natz is \nworking hard as \ninterim Duce.<PAGE>Unlike Duce Belius, we're \nable to see him frequently...one \nfeels very close to him.'
263769:'It's true he doesn't have the charisma \nDuce Belius had, even though she \nalways kept herself hidden away.'
263770:'Lord Natz is doing his very \nbest to protect this city.<PAGE>Now all the citizens have to make a \nconcerted effort to unite behind him.'
263771:'I don't care what's happening in \nany of the other cities. If Nordopolica \nis peaceful, I'm happy.'
263772,263776:'You lot came to fight, didn't \nyou? I can tell by your eyes. \nWhat a bunch of eager beavers!<PAGE>How I love to see people \nlike you get the stuffing \nkicked out of them.'
263773,263777:'Hey, no offense. This may \nbe a spectator arena, but \nthe monsters are monsters.<PAGE>It's not unusual for some pretty \ntough customers to leave the \ncoliseum bruised and broken.'
263774:'Hey you, what are you \ndoing wandering about?<PAGE>Aer krene? Phaeroh? \nWhat are you \ntalking about?'
263775:'What are you doing \nhere just wandering around?<PAGE>There’s no great information \nin this town, \nwe’re out in the sticks you know!'
263778:'A bearded old man ran \nout of the coliseum \nand out of town.<PAGE>There are many like him that just \nrun away after losing a tournament.'
263779:'The old man that ran away \nwas different to the normal \nsorts you get at the coliseum...<PAGE>Well, I guess there \nare some like him \nthere...sometimes. '
263780:'You're travelers, right? I'll \ntell it to you straight. There's \nnothing on this continent.<PAGE>There's a road, but it's a dead end. The \ncaves are all full of monsters, and beyond \nthem is desert and desolate mountains.'
263781:'There's a town out there \nthey call an oasis, but it's \njust another sand pit.<PAGE>Look, I won't say any more. \nYou best get back on your ship \nand go home to mama, huh?'
263782:'Oh, man...what do they think \nthey're doing, just letting \nthe Knights in like that?<PAGE>A lot of people here \nhate the Empire. There \nmight be trouble.'
263783:'Not that I'd mind. Maybe \nwe'll have us a little \nbit of sightseeing.'
263784:'What? Belius is dead? Now things \nare really getting interesting.<PAGE>The only reason this town lasted \nis because Belius was around.'
263785:'Seems like more Knights are coming in \nto Nordopolica every day. I wonder what \nPalestralle's going to do about it?<PAGE>Heh-heh...This is going \nto be fun. A real show!'
263786:'How boring...the Knights are \nactually pretty well-behaved.<PAGE>You might even say it's thanks to them \nthings have quieted down around here.'
263787:'Hmph. I'm surprised at how spineless \nthe people here really are.<PAGE>Not to mention, Belius turned out to \nbe a lot less popular than I thought.'
263788:'Ha ha ha ha! What the hell's that \nthing in the sky? Some kind of monster? \nLooking good, looking good!<PAGE>What's this then, the end of the \nworld? Ha ha ha! Bring it on!'
263789:'I don't care. I don't care if this \ntown, this continent, the entire \nworld goes up in flames. Hmph.'
263790:'Now it's Ilyccia \nin a panic!<PAGE>The seas and the skies going mad! \nHow festive! It's a party, a \nbig old party! Ha ha ha ha!'
263791:'...I don't know. Now I'm feeling empty. \nWhat the hell am I carrying on about?<PAGE>If I don't act like this...if I \nstart to see what's really going \non...it'll be so frightening...'
263792:'I came to Desier to search \nfor the origin of we \nKritya in the west.<PAGE>But the mountain path has \ncollapsed, and I've had \nto forsake that goal...'
263793:'If only I could get beyond the mountain \npath...the land beyond is flat and \nwould be comparatively easy going.<PAGE>At least, that's how it \nlooks on the maps.\n'
263794:'It seems I have much more hard \ntravel to endure if I'm to discover \nthe origin of the Kritya.<PAGE>Even if I somehow get through the \nmountains, they say the lands beyond \nare vast and brutal desert.'
263795:'The only people I can imagine going \nout into that desert would be pioneers, \nthrillseekers, or madmen.'
263796,273827:'I'm considering postponing my quest \nfor the origins of the Kritya \nand staying here for a while.<PAGE>Belius, the Duce of Nordopolica, \nhas expressed a desire \nin meeting me.'
263797:'If things go well, \nshe may offer me \nemployment...'
263798:'I can't believe Duce Belius \nis dead...we were supposed to meet \nand have all manner of discussions.<PAGE>What an unfortunate twist of fate. \nIt was such a promising chance...'
263799:'This must be a message from the \nheavens: "Go and discover the \norigin of the Kritya"...'
263800:'I've had Lord Natz arrange \nfor me to work at the \ncoliseum's library.<PAGE>It's quite befitting a city of such history. \nThere are enough books there to satisfy \nany Kritya's thirst for knowledge.'
263801:'I may even be able to discover \nour origins without ever having \nto go beyond those mountains.'
263802:'I once saw an image that looked \nvery much like that ominous \nshadow in the sky.<PAGE>It must have been in one of \nthe books in my parents' room, \nwhen I was very young...'
263803:'I get the feeling we Kritya somehow \nhave a very deep connection \nto that beast in the sky...'
263804:'Long ago, the clans of old and the human \nruling class stood in partnership, \nunited through Kritya mediation.<PAGE>This may finally be \nour time to stand up.'
263805:'Yes, I remember now. It \nwas in a passage in one \nof my parents' books.<PAGE>Be it lies or truth, I \nbelieve this is a duty \nassigned to our people.'
263806:'*Huff*...*huff*...*huff*...<PAGE>What...*pant*...am \nI...*pant*...doing?'
263807:'Whew...I'm thinking about \ntaking part in a tournament, \nthat's what.<PAGE>I'm in training, you see. \nGot to build stamina.'
263808:'*Huff*...*huff*...*huff*...*huff*...\n*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...\nI'm starting to get bored with...<PAGE>*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...\n...Swinging this sword...'
263809:'Whew...Maybe go for a jog \noutside town? No...the monsters \nare too dangerous...'
263810:'*Huff*...*huff*...*huff*...*huff*...\n*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...\nThe Knights are such a pain...<PAGE>*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...\n...I wish they wouldn't...look at me...\n...It's so...embarrassing...'
263811:'...What do we even need \nwith the Knights when \nwe're around...?'

263813:'Whew...Cados is closed, sea \nroutes are closed, and the mountain \npath is impassable.<PAGE>Nordopolica's completely \nindependent now...'
263814:'Don! Don! Doooooon!! Aaaaaah...!! \nThe Don...how could the \nDon have died...?!<PAGE>This shock...how am I supposed...to \nexpress it?!'
263815:'If only I had been in Dahngrest! \nDon! Doooon! I wouldn't \nhave let you die!<PAGE>Don! Don! Doooooon!!'
263816:'*Huff*...*huff*... This is no \ntime...to mourn... *Pant*...*pant*... \n...the Don's death...<PAGE>*Huff*...*huff*... Now I have \nto train... *Pant*...*pant*... \n...to kill that monster...!'
263817:'Whew...I wonder how much training \nI'll have to do to be able \nto kill that thing...?'
263818:'*Huff* *huff*... I'll keep swinging \nthis sword... *Pant*...*pant*... \nfor tomorrow...!'
263819:'Whew...the road to victory \nis a long, rugged, and vicious\none...'
263820:'This city is governed by the Guild \nknown as Palestralle, and their \nchief is a woman named Belius.<PAGE>Here in the city, they \ncall her the "Duce" \nout of respect.'
263821:'This world may be a wide one, \nbut the only Guild governing an \nentire city is Palestralle.<PAGE>Dahngrest is different...in \nactuality, it's ruled by \nthe Don and his Union.'
263822:'Nordopolica exists \ncompletely independent \nfrom the Empire.<PAGE>So even if a riot breaks out, \nthe Knight's are not \nallowed to intervene.'
263823:'If the knights did intervene, \nthis would be a big deal!'
263824:'The coliseum is divided into three areas: \nThe market district, the residential \ndistrict, and the coliseum itself.<PAGE>Outsiders are strictly forbidden from \nentering the residential district in \nthe interest of keeping the peace.'
263825:'I'm told you can enter the residential \ndistrict if you become a citizen.<PAGE>I can't imagine there'd \nbe much of interest \nthere, though.'
263826:'The monsters in the coliseum are \nsupposed to get much fiercer \nwhen the new moon approaches.<PAGE>That's why they post especially tough \nmembers of Palestralle to keep watch \non the night of the new moon.'
263827:'I just happened to be inside the \ncoliseum when the reverse barrier \nholding in the monsters failed.<PAGE>It was very frightening, but I'm glad \nit happened during the full moon, when \nthe monsters are relatively docile.'
263828,273849:'The coliseum city is \ncompletely independent \nfrom the Empire.<PAGE>That's partly thanks to it being located \nso far from Ilyccia, where Zaphias is.'
263829:'I'm sure letting Knights in \nlike this goes against the citizenry's \nbetter judgment.'
263830:'They say the person who was actually \nin charge of managing Palestralle \nwas the interim Duce, Natz.<PAGE>Belius's death doesn't seem to \nhave been attributed to any failing \nof his management, either.'
263831:'With that said, the loss of a \nspiritual leader like Belius \nis a great one for this city.'
263832:'I hear the Knights have lost their \ncaptains, and the influence they wield \nis splitting up here and there.<PAGE>It might not be long before \nNordopolica is in the hands \nof Palestralle again.'
263833:'I just wish they would \ndo something about that \nmonster in the sky.'
263834:'You see that headless statue? That's \nthe warriors' protector-goddess, \nthe "Virgin of Benevolence".<PAGE>It's supposed to be almost eight \nhundred years old, the head \nwashed away by a huge wave.'
263835:'Maybe it's time for us to pray \nto her, too. For our own safety, \nand for peace in the world...'
263836:'Hey, mister. Why \ndoesn't that statue \nhave a head?<PAGE>Did someone play a \nprank and steal it?'
263837:'Is it supposed to be a lady? She must \nhave been really pretty, if people \nwanted to make a statue out of her.<PAGE>How nice...I hope they \nmake a statue of \nme some day, too.'
263838:'There's a cave called Cados to \nthe west of town, you know.<PAGE>I've been told I mustn't \ngo near it because \nit's so dangerous.'
263839:'They say it makes a squeaking \nnoise like a flute or something \nwhen the wind blows.<PAGE>That's why it has another name, \nyou know: "The Weasand of Cados".'
263840:'Some monsters got out of the coliseum. The \nreverse barrier must not be very strong!<PAGE>I wonder if they'll come \nand eat me when I'm \nsleeping at night...?'
263841:'By the way, it's called a reverse barrier because \nit's supposed to keep monsters in...the opposite \nof the barriers that keep monsters out.'
263842:'Are the Imperial Knights \nour enemies? Or are \nthey our friends?<PAGE>They killed the monsters for \nus, but the grownups don't seem \nto like them very much.'
263843:'I hope they're \nour friends.<PAGE>It would be awful \nhaving so many \nenemies around!'
263844:'The grownups say Belius died, \nbut I don't really understand. \nI never even saw her.<PAGE>Now the Knights are here, \nand it's peaceful...right?'
263845:'That reminds me, someone \ncalled Don died, too.<PAGE>I've never seen \nhim either. Where \nwas he from?'
263846,273867:'What's that thing in the \nsky? It's moving, isn't \nit? Is it alive?<PAGE>Is that our...enemy?'
263847,273868:'At least we have \nthe Knights here.<PAGE>They'll protect \nus, right?'
263848:'The grownups say the whole \nworld's in chaos.<PAGE>But I'm not scared! We're \nall going to protect \nthis town together.'
263849:'The sky is so high up...that thing \ndoesn't even seem very scary.<PAGE>Is it really even \ndangerous?'
263850:'An accident has occurred within the \ncoliseum, and we have been dispatched \nto deal with the situation.<PAGE>Our duty as Imperial Knights is to \nprotect each and every settlement \nwithin the Empire's territory.'
263851:'We will ensure this \ncity's safety.'
263852,263858,263861,263864,263867,263870:'Welcome to Nordopolica's \nlodging facilities. <PAGE>It's 500 Gald per night... \nWill that be all right?'

263855:'Some suspicious characters stayed\nat the inn a few days ago.<PAGE>We later found out they were \nImperial Knights. They came \naround in armor just now.'
263856:'Why have they come \nto this town?<PAGE>They were standing around town \nwearing normal clothing. \nThey tricked us, the swine!'
263857:'If we knew there were knights\nstaying at the inn, we would have\nshowed them their welcome.'
263873,263876,263879,263882,263885,263888,263891:'Welcome to Fortune's Market's \noutlet store!<PAGE>Going traveling? Jumping into \nthe coliseum? Get everything \nyou need right here!'

263895:'Of course right now, \nthe hottest topic is the coliseum!<PAGE>Those clashing swords \nreally get the spectator’s \nhearts pounding!'
263896:'I'm an informer with all the \nlatest information! The \nSands of Kogorh you say?<PAGE>Well, normally there is a regular \nservice, but right now it's blocked \nup and the road is closed.'
263897:'They say it’ll take \nabout a fortnight to \nrestart regular service.<PAGE>Perhaps around the time \nof the next new moon...'
263898:'I'm an informer who can always deliver \nthe latest information! Right now the hottest \ntopic is the undefeated champion!<PAGE>Clad in some real high-class armor, \nand with awesome swordsmanship!'
263899:'I can't see this champion \nbeing knocked off \nhis pedestal!<PAGE>And I tell you what, this is \ngonna put the tipster out \nof business for a while too!'
263900:'Always the latest information! \nThe coliseum is always hot, but you \nshould steer clear for the time being.<PAGE>...Unless of course you \nwant to be eaten \nby a monster!'
263901:'I can’t rely on help from the Imperial Knights, \nbut if we have Palestralle's support, \nwe could easily take out the monster!'
263902:'Always the latest information! \nToday I’ll tell you about \nBelius’s private face! <PAGE>Duce Belius's beauty is peerless, no \none in the world comes even close...\nBut her age is forever a secret... '
263903:'You want to know \nBelius’s age?<PAGE>Didn't your mother \nteach you it's' rude to ask \na lady her age?'
263904:'I'm an informer who delivers the town's \nlatest information! Every month, something \nhappens on the new moon!<PAGE>No one knows what's \ngoing to happen \nuntil it happens!'
263905:'There could be a storm coming, \nor it might be a rainbow...<PAGE>Good or bad does it all \ndepend on how we behave!?'
263906:'The latest information \nfrom Nordopolica... \nBelius is dead...<PAGE>This is the end, \nfor this job...\nfor Palestralle...'
263907:'This informer is under direct \ncontrol from Palestralle.<PAGE>If there’s no Belius, then doing this \nhas neither meaning \nnor worth.'
263908:'Belius is dead, \nbut at least we have a brand new, \nrevamped tournament!<PAGE>Belius wouldn’t \nwant us moping \naround forever!'
263909:'They are currently \naccepting entries.<PAGE>For now, I would recommend entering \na guy who can take out at \nleast thirty people.'
263910:'Outside there is panic because of the monster\nin the sky. What better way to increase your skills\nto defeat the monster than in the tournament?<PAGE>Taking on the best warriors in \nthe world will be pretty \ngood training for you!'
263911:'The content of the tournament \nhas been reviewed, and the number \nof new entries increased.<PAGE>You should try it out!'
263912:'Always with the town’s latest information! \nToday, allow me to introduce interim Duce\nLord Natz who dispatched the monster!<PAGE>He is 43 years old, divorced once,\nno children. With bulging biceps!\nHe’s on the look out for a girlfriend now!'
263913,263914:'I have just heard that Lord \nNatz has been promoted \nfrom interim to full Duce!<PAGE>Wonderful news!'
263915,263923:'At last, I have \na shop here also!<PAGE>My second shop in Nordopolica, \nopening next month!'
263916,263924:'Everybody says changing shops in \nthis town can be pretty intense!<PAGE>So, I’d better \nget charged up!'
263917:'I went over the \nCados mountain range on \nfoot when I was peddler...<PAGE>But it’s really steep, \nseriously, it’s no laughing \nmatter I can tell you.'
263918:'It’s hard to go over the Cados mountains, \nbut it’s just as hard going through \nthe caves on the mountain's face...<PAGE>There’s nothing even there, so \nwhy even bother... It's nuts!'
263919:'Finally, I have the full \nset of tools available.<PAGE>Next thing’s to open my shop early \nif the goods have arrived...'
263920:'Don’t rush! Don’t rush! \nTake a break \nuntil opening time...'
263921:'Hmmm...\nWhat could that be...\n...uproar in the coliseum...<PAGE>Has the champion won? \nHas the challenger won? \nI knew I should have gone...'
263922:'I can’t get into the \ncoliseum because they \nsay it’s sold out!<PAGE>If only I’d decided \nearlier I could \nhave got in...'
263925:'Just two more weeks \nuntil my shop opens...<PAGE>Ah...I’m nervous \nalready...'
263926:'...Whoops!... I still haven't \nchosen a name for the shop... \nWhat's a good name...?'
263927:'I heard the Duce's dead. I wonder \nif things are gonna be alright?<PAGE>The guilds and the Knights are like \noil and water, if they come there’s \nbound to be more trouble.'
263928:'If the Knights and the guilds start \ntrouble, and if someone dies near \nmy shop, what am I gonna do?!'
263929:'I’m opening soon \nso I’m really \nbusy right now.<PAGE>I’ll take a wee break for now...'
263930:'The ship still hasn’t \narrived with my stock...<PAGE>Kaufman...\nWhat are you doing...'
263931:'Immediate Help Wanted! \nHow does that sound? \n250 Gald an hour.<PAGE>Instant pay rise \nfor hard workers!'
263932:'Help us to \ndouble our sales!<PAGE>Looking for a cool guy \nand a cute young girl!'
263933:'Even if the world is in confusion, \nI have no intention of postponing the \ngrand opening of my shop!<PAGE>You can’t trust a \nbusinessman who is too \nquick to change his plans!'
263934,263935:'The range of goods is perfect! \nPlease come again the next \ntime you’re planning a trip!'
263936,273983:'This town is a treasure trove of \ninformation. We have its long and \nstoried history to thank for that.<PAGE>The more I study, the more \nthe machinations of this \nworld grow clear to me.'
263937:'The Empire's history goes back roughly\neight hundred years. This city is even older...\nsome twelve hundred years old, in fact.<PAGE>It begins at a time when this was just \na primitive stone dueling ground.'
263938:'About twenty or thirty kilometers \nwest is a tall mountain range \ncalled the Mother Cados mountains. <PAGE>It's quite a meaningful name, \nbut it's only used by \nfolks in this town.'
263939:'Over the Mother Cados mountains lie \nthe Sands of Kogorh. But getting \nover those mountains isn't easy!'
263940:'This city is a treasure chest full of knowledge, \nas befitting a place of such history.<PAGE>The more I learn about this city's history, the more \nI feel I understand how the world really works.'
263941:'The Empire's history goes back some eight \nhundred years. This city is even older...some \ntwelve hundred years old, in fact.<PAGE>It begins at a time when this was just \na primitive stone duelling grounds.'
263942:'It seems the Knights went \ndeep inside the coliseum...<PAGE>Something terrible \nmust be happening.'
263943:'This city is truly fascinating...as much for its \nhistorical value as it is for being the gathering \nplace of so many rough-and-tumble types.<PAGE>It seems like such a dichotomy, but \nthe two unite here in Nordopolica.'
263944,273989:'Duce Belius? I haven't yet had the \nhonor of meeting her, but it seems as \nif she has some interest in Kritya.<PAGE>I don't know \nwhy, however.'
263945,273990:'This descendant of an ancient \nclan, the woman who governs \na city of such contrasts...<PAGE>Yes, the woman called \nBelius interests \nme greatly.'
263946:'It's a good thing there \nare Knights here to protect \nthe city's security.<PAGE>One does have to wonder what the \nwarships are for, however.'
263947,273992:'One small misstep, and \nthose warships could destroy \nthis entire town.<PAGE>What a terrible blow to \nhistory the loss of this \nripe old city would be.'
263948:'Duce Belius has passed away...I must \noffer my heartfelt condolences.<PAGE>Death means a great loss, but \nat the same time a rite of passage \nfor those who still live.'
263949:'One cannot feign ignorance and \npretend to be dispassionate on the \noccasion of someone's death.<PAGE>This city will surely be \nfacing a time of trial.'
263950:'The tale of the legendary disaster \nis written of in this city's \nvast library as well.<PAGE>I never imagined \nit would be so \nrepugnant...'
263951:'Should that disaster truly try \nto attack the city, the barrier \nwill be meaningless.<PAGE>Is this how humanity \nwill end...?'
263952:'I'm feverishly researching \nhow we might stand a chance \nof fighting the disaster.<PAGE>But I have yet to come to \nan acceptable conclusion...what \nshould I do...?'
263953:'If there is no answer to be found \nin the records of the past, we must \nseek out the future on our own.<PAGE>In a situation like this, the intuition \nof the living is more valuable \nthan any ancient record.'
263954:'I came here to visit my friend, \nafter he moved into the \nresidential district.<PAGE>But they won't let \nme inside...'
263955,263959,273998:'After coming all this way I was \ndead set on seeing the \ntournament, but it's sold out...<PAGE>Sheesh, way to kick a guy when he's \ndown. What the heck am I gonna do if \nmy luck gets any worse than this?'
263956:'A flying monster that can speak? \nNo...No, I don’t know.<PAGE>You’re looking for \nsomething pretty weird!'
263957:'First of all, \na talking monster? \nThat’s unbelievably scary!<PAGE>I’m scared enough if \nthey don’t speak!'
263958:'I came here to visit \nmy friend, after he moved \ninto the residential district.<PAGE>But they won't \nlet me inside...'
263960:'Is it always \nso noisy here?<PAGE>I was sleeping at \nthe inn, but I was \nwoken by the noise.'
263961:'Has something happened? \nOr is it always \nlike this here?'
263962:'I thought I'd finally be able to see my friend \nwho moved into the residential district, \nbut they only let residents inside.<PAGE>Am I really going to have to stay \nat the inn again today...?'
263963:'I'm not a rich man. I'm not \neven sure how I'm going to \npay for the trip back home.'
263964:'The Knights are surprisingly cheap. All I \ndid was ask them to lend me a little money, \nbut they aren't giving me a single Gald.<PAGE>Aren't the Knights supposed \nto help good, decent \ncitizens in need?'
263965:'Surely it wouldn't \nhurt to lend me enough \nto buy supper...'
263966:'Hey, those warships are going back \nto Zaphias eventually, right?<PAGE>Where's the harm \nin letting me catch \na ride onboard?'
263967:'The Knights are surprisingly \ncheap...actually, perhaps \nit isn't so surprising.'
263968:'Belius died here, and the \nDon died in Dahngrest.<PAGE>Who's next, \nthe captain \nin Zaphias?'
263969:'But...if all three of them died, \nthere'd be nobody left to pull \nthe world back together.<PAGE>What a crisis we'd \nhave then...'
263970:'That monster in the sky, \nit's over Ilyccia?<PAGE>Ohh, thank the heavens. I'm so glad I came \nhere. I'm so happy I didn't go back home!'
263971:'But it's not like I can stay here \nforever...even my friend's been \ncold to me lately...*sigh*...'
263972:'We were relieved because \nwe thought the monster was \naway to Ilyccia...<PAGE>But then we were attacked by\nsomething weird. Disasters occur\nwhen you least expect them!'
263973:'Well, we're O.K. because \nwe’re inside the barrier...\nBut...weren’t they eating the barrier?'
263974:'What? First that spooky thing in the sky, and \nnow a giant tower appears out of nowhere?<PAGE>What the hell's going on? \nIs our world falling apart?'
263975:'My head's like a mad woman's breakfast! \nI can't make sense of anything!'
263976,263980:'This is the one and only coliseum \nin the entire world. People come \nfrom far and wide just to see it.<PAGE>You folk aren't from around here either, \nare you? Anyone could tell looking \nat your mismatched outfits.'
263977:'The coliseum is massive enough to not \nonly hold a crowd of spectators, but an \nentire residential district as well.<PAGE>As you can see, we have a market, \nan inn...the coliseum is really one\ngiant city.'
263978:'On the way to the Sands of Kogorh,\n there is a shortcut through \nthe Cados mountain range.<PAGE>But it's just sand. \nWhat on earth do you \nwant to go there for?'
263979:'That reminds me, the Cados mountain\npass was closed off by fallen rocks\nsome years ago. I think...'
263981,274012,274016:'The coliseum is massive enough to not \nonly hold a crowd of spectators, but an \nentire residential district as well.<PAGE>As you can see, we have a market, \nan inn...the coliseum is \nreally one giant city.'
263982,274017:'Why are there Knights \nin this town?<PAGE>If we leave it as it is, the discipline \nwe worked hard to build in \nthe coliseum will collapse!'
263983,274014,274018:'We protect this \ntown ourselves, \nno matter what!<PAGE>We’ve managed \nalright so far without \nthe Empire’s help.'
263984,274019:'This city is built upon the idea \nof its citizens having equal \nstatus with Palestralle.<PAGE>We don't submit to absolute \nrule of the Empire's \nkind here.'
263985,274020:'That fact is the pride of every man, \nwoman and child in Nordopolica.<PAGE>Of course, outsiders seem to have \na hard time understanding it.'
263986,274021:'I'm astounded they let Imperial Knights in. Not \nto worry, though...Palestralle and the warriors \nfrom the coliseum are all tough cookies.<PAGE>They'll have the Knights \nthrown out in no time.'
263987,274022:'Duce Belius would never \npermit Imperial Knights entry \nin the first place...'

263990:'The Knights, those sneaky bastards. They \nthink they can take over this town \nby smartly pretending to defend it?<PAGE>If only Duce Belius were still alive...she \nnever would have permitted such tyranny...'
263991:'But she's gone...Duce \nBelius is gone...'
263992:'This is all the Knights' fault! \nThey're the reason that horrible \nthing is in the sky.<PAGE>It's true, isn't it? I know it is!'
263993:'This is all the Knights' fault! It's their \nfault ships are wrecked at sea. And it's \ntheir fault there are storms in port!'
263994:'This is all the Knights' \nfault! They're the reason \nthat tower appeared.<PAGE>It's true, isn't it? I know it is!'
263995:'This is all the Knights' fault! It's their \nfault Duce Belius died. And it's \ntheir fault that tomatoes are red!'
263996:'I'm a member of Palestralle, the \nguild that governs this city.<PAGE>I'm on patrol today, \nas usual.'
263997:'You start any needless trouble, \nI'll be there to slap you \nwith a sanction in a flash!'
263998:'What’s that? \nSome Knights are heading \nto the coliseum?<PAGE>They must have \nbeen in hiding here \nall along!'
263999:'What’s going on? \nWhat are the Knights doing there...!?'
264000:'The tournament champion was \na captain in the Knights?<PAGE>We never would have let \nthe Knights in if we'd \nfound out sooner.'
264001:'We've always made quick \nwork of any monster, because \nwe work as a team.'
264002,275250:'I got a report that the Knights \nhave closed down Cados.<PAGE>Sounds like there's some big stink \nhappening up top. Who the hell \ndo the Knights think they are?'
264003,275251:'We may have had a bit of trouble \nhere lately, but now they're \nway out of bounds.<PAGE>I want to raise some serious protest, \nbut it's out of my league...'
264004,275252:'The Union's really \ndone it now...<PAGE>I always knew the Don \nwas after the Duce's \ngood stuff!'
264005,275253:'The only faction that can stand \ntoe-to-toe with the Union and \nthe Empire is Palestralle.<PAGE>The Don in the north and Belius to the \nsouth...they weren't playing around.'
264006,275254:'The interim Duce's doing a pretty good \njob of keeping Palestralle together.<PAGE>Our only problem now is the \nKnights making such a nuisance \nof themselves in town...'
264007,275255:'The whole deal with the Union was just \na misunderstanding. Why do we still \nhave to have the Knights watch us?'
264008,275256:'That's some weird stuff going \non in the sky, there.<PAGE>What do you suppose it is? Some \nnasty work of the Empire's?'
264009,275257:'Nah...no human hand could have \nbrought that thing to life...'

264011:'Is that monster \nsome how connected to \nthe one in the sky?<PAGE>It’s nasty looking!!'
264012:'Even if the whole rest of the world goes \nto hell, Nordopolica will be safe.<PAGE>It's only the Empire that's \ngoing down. Palestralle will \ndefend this city to the end!'

264014:'I get to live in this \ntown, you know.<PAGE>Not bad, huh? Pretty nice, huh?\nYou jealous?'
264015:'I'm gonna get big and strong \nlike Kratos and be a coliseum \nhero myself some day.<PAGE>You guys wouldn't even have a \nchance against him. He's the \nstrongest man in the world.'

264315:'Isn't there anything we can do to improve \nthe working environment here?<PAGE>I want to be able to do \nsomething for this town.'
264316:'Men work, and women watch the house...who \nmade that rule up, anyway?<PAGE>In my opinion, women should get out of \nthe house more, and be able to work.'
264317:'Ooh, I hate male chauvinism!'
264318:'They say men want two \nthings: danger and play. \nIs that true? <PAGE>My mom tells me that \nkids shouldn't worry \nabout those things...'
264319:'Then let me ask you this. The \nreason men want women...<PAGE>...is because we're the most dangerous \nplaything! Is that right?'
264320:'Just looking at the weathervane \nisn't going to make you rich.<PAGE>You have to predict from what direction \nthe wind will spin it next!'
264321:'Of course, the best way to make \nyour predictions reality is to \nforce the wind to blow yourself.<PAGE>Yes...I'm going to have \nto set a trend!'
264322:'My family moved \nfrom the port town a \nlittle while back.<PAGE>My friends and I were writing letters \nback and forth, but I haven't gotten \nany letters from them in a while.'
264323:'I'm a little worried...'
264324:'My mommy and daddy really \nlike each other...<PAGE>They kiss each other good morning, \nthey kiss each other good night...they're \nalways kissing!'
264325:'Mommy scolded me when \nI said that before...<PAGE>Why? Why do you think, \nmister? Why would \nmommy get so mad?'
264326:'Mommy always tells me \nto be a good girl...<PAGE>What do you think it means \nto be a good girl?'
264327:'If I'm not a good girl...does \nthat make me a bad girl...?'
264328:'Mommy always says \nto be quiet in town...<PAGE>But she's talking \nall the time...'
264329:'Why do I have to be quiet?'
264330,264331:'Ever since that fine young knight, \nSir <STR>(FRE), came, we've \nbeen receiving a salary...<PAGE>I'm so thankful...'
264332:'I bought my daughter some shoes.<PAGE>I felt so sorry for her always walking around \nbarefoot. It's dangerous, you know.'
264333:'Today was our payday. \nTonight, real meat!<PAGE>It's the one thing I splurge on each month.'
264334:'Everyone has a big \nmouth, but...<PAGE>...the mouths of children really \nare bottomless pits, aren't they?'
264335:'I get so worried about what \nmy daughter might be saying \noutside I can't leave him alone.'
264336:'It may be fun to gossip about \nother people, but...<PAGE>...it's not very pleasant when \npeople gossip about you, is it?'
264337:'I suppose it can't be helped.<PAGE>That's just what \nsmall talk is.'
264338:'My grandson died on the job the other day...<PAGE>He always said working here would \nmake him a noble some day...'
264339:'My grandson's death left an \nunoccupied position, so I've \nhad to take over his job...<PAGE>At this age, heavy work from sunup \nto sundown isn't easy...'
264340:'Isn't there anything an old \nwoman can do for this town?<PAGE>There must be something...'
264341:'I want to find something I can do, however \nsmall, to aid the excavations here.<PAGE>They say old age only begins when \nyou lose your drive, you know.'
264342:'I've been allowed to start looking after \nthe children at the orphanage.<PAGE>There was something this old \nwoman could do, after all.'
264343:'Watching after the children isn't \neasy, but it's a job worth doing.<PAGE>Sometimes, I feel like I'm raising \nmy own grandson again...'
264344:'The first step in raising a child right \nis to make them follow the rules.<PAGE>If they don't follow the basic \nrules, how will they make friends, \nand find partners some day?'
264345:'There are certain rules one \nmust learn and abide by \nto function in society.<PAGE>Our job as adults is \nto ensure children \nlearn these rules.'
264346:'Children are like mirrors that \nreflect the adults around them.<PAGE>Rather than bemoan our children's \nmanners, it is essential that \nwe set the right example.'
264347:'Even we grew up following \nour elders' examples...<PAGE>Children today are \nno different.'
264348:'I'm a very good cook.<PAGE>I'm going to do my best to provide the \nworkers here with good, hot meals!'
264349:'Hmm...good, hot meals. Curry! \nThat's the thing.'
264350:'What shall I prepare today?<PAGE>I may not have the finest ingredients \nat my disposal, but I look at it as a \nchance to show what I'm really made of.'
264351:'Good ingredients don't \nmake good meals.<PAGE>It takes a good \ncook to do that.'
264352:'I like to think that cookery is something \nbest done for people you love.'
264353:'Eating is what sustains \nour lives, right?<PAGE>That's why I believe that cooking \nfor someone you love is also the \nact of protecting their life.'
264354:'The invention of a new \ndish is more useful than \nthat of a new weapon.<PAGE>It doesn't take a genius to figure \nout that filling stomachs is more \nuseful than killing people.'
264355:'How is that, you ask?<PAGE>Just think about it. If a wife cooks well, \nher husband doesn't cheat on her.'
264356,274403:'I used to work upstairs,\nbut I was forced to\ncome down here...<PAGE>Cooking for the laborers,\nmorning and night...\nThere's no time to rest.'
264357:'I came from nearby village \nbecause I heard there \nwere good jobs here.<PAGE>Now I regret having \nbeen so naive...'
264358:'I was supposed to be working as \na maid in a noble's manor...<PAGE>Who could have imagined that noble \nwould suddenly be brought to ruin...?'
264359:'Wait, I've got it!<PAGE>What if I start a cafe where all the \nwaitresses dress like maids...?'
264360:'Do you like maid cafes?'
264361:'My customers tell me, \n"maids are so moe!".<PAGE>What does "moe" mean?'
264362:'It looks like my maid cafe \nwas a giant success.<PAGE>Maybe I should open \na cat-ears cafe next?'
264363:'What sorts of cafes \ndo you like?<PAGE>Tsundere cafes?'
264364:'My latest business \nis a cosplay cafe!<PAGE>What kinds of uniforms \ndo you like?'
264365:'My recommendations lately \nare nurse and nun outfits.'
264366:'I work as a delivery man.<PAGE>No matter what your job, labor \nis a very precious thing.'
264367:'Oh, I used to be a marine navigator \nfor the pirate's guild, Siren's Fang.<PAGE>After the guild was no more, \nI took a land job, but I'm having \ntrouble finding myself.'
264368:'"Liquor is the chief of all medicines." Didn't \nthe people of old know how to put it best?<PAGE>All right! My work's done for today!'
264369:'I know they say, "drink the booze, \ndon't let the booze drink you", but...<PAGE>...Hey, there's nothing wrong \nwith a headache in the morning \nevery once in a while, is there?'
264370:'Hey, I know liquor's poison to the \nbody. You don't have to tell me.<PAGE>But what about the soul, eh? That's right. \nBooze is medicine for the soul.'
264371:'The time I spend drinking \nisn't wasted.<PAGE>Not at all. When I drink, my \nsoul gets a chance to rest.'
264372:'"One cup, the man drinks the wine. Two \ncups, the wine drinks the wine. Three \ncups, the wine drinks the man."<PAGE>Hey, I know what the saying \nmeans...moderation, right?'
264373:'Liquor is a friend for life!'
264374:'Thanks to Sir <STR>(FRE), \nI get gruel to eat \nevery night!<PAGE>I'm so happy.'
264375:'Before, I would always \ndrink a whole bunch of \nwater to get my belly full...'
264376:'Now I get bread to \neat every night!<PAGE>I'm so happy.'
264377:'I got new clothes!<PAGE>I'm so happy.'
264378:'Now I get to eat \nmeat every night!<PAGE>I'm so happy.'
264379:'I got a new dollie!<PAGE>I'm so happy.'
264380:'Now I can eat any food I want, \nand I get anything I ask for...<PAGE>But, for some reason, \nI'm not very happy...'
264381:'Is all this stuff really \nwhat we wanted?<PAGE>Living in so much comfort \nisn't fun at all...and \nI'm not happy.'
264382:'There are many inconvenient things \nabout living in poverty...<PAGE>But I wouldn't say it's an unhappy life.'
264383:'There may not be any wonderful \nliving in this town.<PAGE>Instead, I think we \ncan live wonderfully.'
264384:'One of the good things about \nbeing poor is that you never \nhave to worry about burglars.'
264385:'You're only poor because \nyou think you're poor.<PAGE>I'm fine as long as I \nthink I'm satisfied.'
264386:'It is said that God treats \nevery person equally.<PAGE>Powerful, weak, rich, \nor poor...how thankful \nwe must be for this!'
264387:'If people are going to venerate an \nentity as witless as this God...<PAGE>Who needs him! Don't \nyou agree?'
264388:'As long as you have bread...and \ndon't starve...<PAGE>...you can endure almost anything, \nno matter how painful.'
264389:'Compared to the meal that \nrelieves a day's hunger...<PAGE>...nothing else has \nany real value.'
264390:'This is the armory.<PAGE>You may not enter \nwithout permission.'
264391:'I think people should be more \nconcerned with buying bread \nbefore they buy armaments...'
264392:'"The unavoidable battle is just, \nand weapons are sanctified when \nthey offer the only hope"...<PAGE>In a certain sense, those \nwords may be true.'
264393:'Even so, weapons are weapons \nno matter the circumstances: \nTools for killing.<PAGE>How could they \never be considered \nsanctified?'
264394:'Why do wars occur...?<PAGE>Perhaps because men respond \nto weapons with more weapons.'
264395:'I've been thinking...<PAGE>If men were to respond to weapons with \nbread, there would be no more war.'
264396:'Peace is not simply a state of no war.<PAGE>Peace is a virtue, and a state of mind. \nPeace is a mind seeking benevolence, \nbelief in the self, and justice.'
264397:'I pray that this world and the people \nwho live upon it will find peace...'
264398:'The first step to stabilizing a country \nis the eradication of poverty.<PAGE>Saving the people of this town \nis saving the country itself.'
264399:'When the lives of the people are \nenriched, so is their country.<PAGE>It's simply a matter of course.'
264400:'The peace we Knights can \nensure is only temporary.<PAGE>If people only want peace for \na year, they may rely on us.'
264401:'However, should the people want a century \nof peace...they must unite to protect \nthe Empire for themselves.<PAGE>This country has within it a power \nsuperior to a thousand armies.'
264402:'The Empire is a sailing vessel, \nits people the winds...<PAGE>How these winds act upon the sail of politics \nwill determine whether or not the rough \nseas of the age can be crossed.'
264403:'You're brave to \nleave the city.<PAGE>...Are you a hero?'
264404:'Life is but a series of battles...and \ndeath marks their end.<PAGE>To rush into battle with no fear of dying \nis nothing but sheer imprudence.'
264405:'We must fight to live!<PAGE>One cannot fight if they are dead...'
264406:'In order to stabilize \nthe country, we must \nfirst eradicate poverty! <PAGE>Saving the citizens of this city \nis the way to save the country.'
264407:'Power is appropriate only for \nthose who know how to wield it.'
264408:'If one desires power they must \nwork for it. They must work \nfor it if it kills them.<PAGE>Nobody who's said they'd accomplish \nsomething "if it killed them" has \never actually been killed, you know.'
264409:'You should be wary of those who strive towards \na goal without saying anything at all.<PAGE>People like that go to their \ngraves silently...'
264410:'Today proudly valiant, tomorrow \nlying in our graves...<PAGE>That is a knight's very way of life.'
264411:'This may not be appropriate for a knight \nsuch as myself to say, but...I believe \nman must bring war to an end.<PAGE>If we do not, war may bring \nall manking to its end...'
264412:'I take pride in my \nstatus as a knight.<PAGE>At the same time, I wish for a world at \npeace with no need for knights at all.'
264413:'How many people there are that feed \nupon the blood of the innocent...!'
264414:'Cumore and the knights under \nhis command have cleared out.<PAGE>Things should finally be getting \nmuch saner in this town.'
264415:'I hope Heliord will be a place where \nhard-working people will find reward.'
264416:'Like many others, I joined the Knights \nbecause I always admired them...<PAGE>However, the reality of being a knight is \nmuch less exciting than I had thought.'
264417:'The Knights do not exist to \nfight ostentatious battles.<PAGE>We are here to protect the peace! \nThat alone is our sole purpose.'
264418:'A war can be begun with nothing \nmore than a single dagger...<PAGE>...but the ending of war is a trying task \nfor even the most battle-hardened hero.'
264419:'The only thing capable of staunching \nbloodshed is reason...'
264420:'If you had to choose between \na just war, or an unjust peace...which \nwould it be?<PAGE>There is no such \nthing as a just war.'
264421:'In my studies, I have learned \nthat there has never been \na war one might term just.<PAGE>Peace is preferable to any \nwar that might be imagined.'
264422,264424,264426,264428,274469,274471,274473,274475:'If you want to pass, then pass.'
264423,264425,264427,264429:'You may go!'
264430:'Discipline has returned to Heliord.<PAGE>It is a fine thing.'
264431:'Discipline is the most important virtue of \nall! Second comes perseverance, third bravery, \nthen gallantry, and finally ambition...<PAGE>Do you agree?'
264432:'Weakness is something only the \ncommon man is permitted.<PAGE>Strength, above all, is \nexpected of a knight.'
264433:'A knight cannot live without strength, yet \nan unkind man is not qualified to live.<PAGE>Will I be able to become a knight \nof both strength and kindness?'
264434:'Nobody is born strong. Everyone \nbegins life weak.<PAGE>I believe that coming to know one's \nweaknesses, one by one, is the \nway people become stronger.'
264435:'A place where even the \nweak can survive, \nwithout adapting...<PAGE>I would like for nothing more than \nHeliord to become that sort of \nplace, but reality is harsh.'
264436:'By poring over the history \nbooks, it is clear that they \nare all records of war.<PAGE>I am sure the future holds \ncountless more wars.'
264437:'Even so, we must not accept \nwar as mankind's fate.<PAGE>One thing we must learn from our history \nwrit in blood: The will to follow through to \nthe very end, to avoiding war entirely.'
264438:'The commodities Cumore had monopolized will \nnow be distributed amongst the citizens.<PAGE>The lives of the laborers here should \nbecome a little bit easier.'
264439:'Nothing will change \novernight, though.<PAGE>We are prepared to make every \neffort to help them.'
264440:'All men are born the same, but individual \nways of living are to each his own; even \nmore innumerable are their ways of death.<PAGE>Nevertheless, we believe the \nknights live with one will, \nand must die with one will.'
264441:'Most people are born crying, \nlive complaining, \nand die despairing.<PAGE>I, however, wish to live \nlife to its utmost, dying \na satisfied man.\n'
264442:'The regret that comes from having \nfailed to act is far deeper than \nthat of having acted and failed.<PAGE>I beseech you...never claim \nyou are unable to act at \na time when you must.'
264443:'People are often more concerned \nwith the possessions of their \nneighbors than with their own.<PAGE>Try not to be distracted by the possessions of \nothers...for you may find yourself forgetting \nthe precious things you already have.'
264444:'Have you ever thought \nabout your life?<PAGE>Are you conscious of the fact that \nthe moment that just passed, gone \nforever, was a part of that life?'
264445:'A fleeting moment is but a short lifetime...and \na lifetime is nothing more than a long moment.<PAGE>One must live every moment as earnestly as \nif it were their entire life, their life \nas relaxed as if it were a single moment.'
264446:'Our leaders may change, but \nour daily work does not.<PAGE>Of course, I'd be glad if those new \nleaders bring with them a fair rule.'
264447:'I can imagine no greater happiness than having \nmy work be of benefit to this town.'
264448:'One must never turn back simply \nbecause the mountain is tall.<PAGE>As long as you keep putting one foot in front of the \nother, any mountain can eventually be crossed.'
264449:'One must not become lackadaisical simply \nbecause their work is difficult.<PAGE>By continuing to tackle each problem one by \none, any job can eventually be finished.'
264450:'The most important thing in work...\nNo, the most important thing living \nas a human being...is trust.<PAGE>One cannot leave important work, \nnor precious monies to people \nwho cannot be trusted.'
264451:'One must do the same things, the \nsame way, day in, day out.<PAGE>There is no other \nway to gain trust.'
264452:'Gaining trust takes a great \ndeal of time, but it can be \nlost in the blink of an eye.<PAGE>If you keep that fact in mind, the way \nyou live your life will surely change.'
264453:'I will regain the trust I lost today \nby working harder tomorrow!<PAGE>I'll do everything in \nmy power to do so.'
264454:'You can quit any time you want. \nYou may find relief, but...<PAGE>You will also lose a great deal.'
264455:'On the other hand, persevering \nmay be painful and difficult...<PAGE>But I believe rewards equal to one's \nperseverance always follow.'
264456:'You mustn't vacillate about your life.<PAGE>All the thinking in the world won't ever answer \nthe question, "what is the meaning of life?".'
264457:'Don't vacillate. Don't overthink...<PAGE>Only people who strive to live in the moment \ncan find the answer to that question.'
264458:'If there's somebody in this world who has \na task they absolutely must accomplish...<PAGE>I'd like to be that somebody.'
264459:'Don't you think people like \nthat are admirable?<PAGE>They might not have the power to change \nthe world, but admirable they are.'
264460:'The last blessing you will receive in this \nworld is the knowing of your purpose.<PAGE>And, of course, the fulfillment \nof that purpose.'
264461:'Just begin with \nsomething you know \nyou can do.<PAGE>The first thing one \nmust do is begin.'
264462:'Just like I said, eh?<PAGE>Nobody's becoming a noble here.'
264463:'I think working is useless.'
264464:'If I'm not going to become \na noble...what's the point?<PAGE>I'm just going to do what I want.'
264465:'*Sigh*\nWhat is so fun about\nworking tirelessly...?'
264466:'Why should I have to do the things \nsomeone else will do for me?<PAGE>They call people like \nthat "suckers".'
264467:'I'd rather be a slacker \nthan a sucker, you know.'
264468:'It's not as if there any many truly \nimportant things in this world...<PAGE>In any case, the truly important things \nget handled by the people who are \nsupposed to take care of them.'
264469:'I'm not making excuses for slacking off.<PAGE>That's just life...it's \nthe way the world works.'
264470:'Throughout history, there have always \nbeen two types of people.<PAGE>That's right. The rulers, \nand the ruled.'
264471:'Everyone working in this town,\nwithout exception, are among the latter.'
264472:'What was that sound...?\nI'm curious...<PAGE>I'm curious, but until the end of my shift,\nI can't leave here...'
264473:'To protect what needs to be protected.\nThat is the job of a Knight...<PAGE>But I'm anxious about\nthat explosion I heard...'
264474:'The high-and-mighties sure didn't \nwaste much time running off!'
264475:'It's always the downtrodden that get \nforced to do the dirty work...'
264476:'Where was Heliord's fancy ruler \nwhen his town was in crisis?'
264477:'Authorities are never there when it matters, \nand don't make a difference even if they are.<PAGE>Even worse, they always butt their \nheads in when they're least wanted.'
264478:'The only person you can rely \non in a crisis is yourself!'
264479:'I'm not foolish enough to leave my fate \nin the hands of an inept leader.'
264480:'Putting up with my superior's \nunreasonable demands, cleaning up \nincompetent underlings' messes...<PAGE>I'm tired of it...'
264481:'I'm completely exhausted from staying \nup working night after night!<PAGE>Is this really what a knight \nis supposed to be doing?!'
264482:'Effort always bears fruit. Persevering until you \nharvest that fruit is the definition of effort!<PAGE>People put faith in notions like that, \nand then die in obscurity...'
264483:'Nobles are winners, commoners \nare losers. Everything \nis decided by birth!'
264484:'What was that?! \nThat shake just now!'
264485:'It sounds like some \nsort of explosion. \nWhat was that?'
264486:'Repairing the blastia \nis a job for mages.<PAGE>Petty negotiations \nare a job for Knights \nof lower birth.'
264487:'Me? I have been given the \nnoble task of supervising \nby Sir Cumore!'
264488:'I swear, the commoners \nare completely \nuseless. <PAGE>They just let the blastia \nrun out of control? What \nwere they thinking?!'
264489:'It seems that we, the \nnobility, need to keep \na closer eye on them.'
264490:'Those commoners... They claim that there \nare no class divisions among Knights.<PAGE>Grrrr... They make \nme so angry!'
264491:'Only 5 years since the regime \nchange, and already the nobility \nare being ignored.'
264492:'This city is growing\nthanks to us, the Cumore Brigade\nand our management of the people!<PAGE> In all cases, the commoners\nshould be under the control of the nobility!'
264493:'Glory to Heliord,\nthe city built by nobles!'
264494:'I knew he would do it. That \n<STR>(FRE)... He's some Knight.<PAGE>I am fortunate to \nserve under him.'
264495:'Self-indulgent fools like \nCumore never succeed.'
264496:'I've served under a number \nof ineffectual superiors...<PAGE>The less effectual, the better they \nbelieve they are. Dealing with people \nlike that is so difficult...'
264497:'But this <STR>(FRE) seems \nto be an exception.<PAGE>A good commander never sticks his head \nin where he doesn't belong, and doesn't \nleave everything to his subordinates.'
264498:'Authorities may have a position above \nthose of other men, but that doesn't \nmean they can look down on them.<PAGE>Instead, they need a humility that \nallows them to see things from the \nsame point of view as everyone else.'
264499:'<STR>(FRE) passes that test.'
264500:'We are loyal to our Empire, but perhaps a \nbetter way of putting it would be to say we \nare loyal to the people who support us...<PAGE>...our family \nand friends.'
264501:'Protecting this city as part of the \n<STR>(FRE) Brigade is just one way to \nshow our love for Captain <STR>(FRE).<PAGE>...What?\nDon't look at \nme like that.'
264502:'Training and discipline is unlikely \nto produce quick results.<PAGE>Even so, one must never abandon \ntheir daily training.'
264503:'I believe.<PAGE>I believe that difficult \ntraining is always rewarded...'
264504:'This is a facility for the Imperial \nKnights. You should leave if \nyou have no business here.<PAGE>There is nothing \nhere for you.'
264505:'It is sad that people \navoid us just because \nwe're Knights.<PAGE>However, that is a burden \nwe must bear as Knights.'
264506,264509:'...\nYou think you're \ngonna stay here? You're \ngonna pay 100 Gald.'
264508:'You get to stay here thanks \nto Sir Cumore. You \nshould be grateful.'
264510:'Sorry. We're not opened \nfor business yet. <PAGE>Please come again.'
264511,274554:'I said we're not ready.\nCome back later.'
264512,264515,264518,264521,264524:'Would you like to\nstay for 350 Gald?'
264514,264517,264520,264523,264526,274557,274560,274563,274566,274569:'Thank you very much.\nEnjoy your stay.'
264527:'We knights usually have severe training \nfrom morning to night...<PAGE>What's worse, we always have to be on \nthe scene first if there's a situation.'
264528:'Frankly, I regret joining the Knights. \nThis simply isn't a decent job.'
264529:'Situations are rare where \nwe would be able to use the \ntraining we do every day.<PAGE>I'm starting to feel like \nthe training is useless.'
264530:'Uhh...what are we supposed \nto do at a time like this?'
264531:'All that ridiculously difficult training was \njust our captain tormenting his underlings...'
264532:'I can tell you firsthand that our regular training \nwasn't going to be good for anything.'
264533:'The reason we Knights train so \ndiligently day in and day out is because \nthere are people we must protect.'
264534:'What is your training for?<PAGE>You can't consider training meaningful unless \nyou think about such things yourself.'

264552,274595:'Welcome.\nI got some new weapons in!\nTake a look and buy what you like.'
264564:'...You know, the Cumore Brigade\nis made up of arrogant Knights\nof noble class.<PAGE>But these nobles\nare a far cry\nfrom the royal class.'
264565:'Knights are Knights, right?\nWhat do they have to brag about?'
264566:'*Sigh* I didn't join the Imperial Knights\nto slave under a grump\nwho's all talk and no walk.'
264567:'Even if I can't make the guards,\nI wonder if I can make\nthe Schwann Brigade...'
264568:'First I was placed in a \nBrigade not of my choosing,\nthen the blastia failure...<PAGE>Just my luck.'
264569:'I'll have to get a spiritual cleansing...'
264570:'It was so unexpected...\nTo have a dragon charmer\nin our midst?<PAGE>I was in the middle of eating,\nso I didn't get to go.'
264571:'No more.\nI don't want to work \nsecurity anymore...'
264572:'It's been strange lately.\nThe people of the town \nare disappearing.<PAGE>Nothing like this has happened\nsince I started working as a Knight...'
264573:'Is this what daily life is like\non the Tolbyccia continent?<PAGE>I can't take it...\nI want to go back to Zaphias...\nor at least Torim Harbor...'
264574,264577,264580,264583,274617,274620,274623,274626:'Welcome. Will you \nbe staying? That \nwill be 350 Gald.'
264576,264579,264582,264585:'Have a safe \njourney.'
264586:'I ran away from\nthe Cumore Brigade\nby the skin of my teeth.<PAGE>I wonder where\nthose guys are now...'
264587:'And now, I'm a Knight\nof the <STR>(FRE) Brigade!'
264588:'Welcome, travelers. \nPlease take a look \nat our wares.'
264590:'Thank you very \nmuch. We await your \nnext visit.'
264591:'Welcome. Are you looking \nfor souvenirs? You \ncan find them here.'

264594:'The coliseum, scene of countless bloody \nbattles...it's so thrilling. I want to \ndie in that stone circle some day...<PAGE>That's my dream. Wild, isn't \nit? It's a shame the coliseum \nis so far from here...'
264595:'The leisurely pace \nof Yormgen just \ndoesn't suit me.<PAGE>I swear that one day I'll stand in \nthe coliseum...and make crimson \nflowers bloom upon its stones...!'
264596:'Say, have you ever been \nto the coliseum?<PAGE>They say the atmosphere there is like \na banquet of madness! Is it true?'
264597:'What? You actually fought in \nthe coliseum? I can't believe \nyou stepped out in one piece!<PAGE>Looks certainly can be \ndeceiving. What kind of \ncrime did you commit?'
264598:'Our village chief is a great man, \nbut the sage is even greater.<PAGE>The sage will drive out any \nmonster that may attack us.'
264599:'The sage is considering \nnew techniques for expelling \nthe monsters.'
264600:'I hear you people have brought \nus the clear ciel crystal?<PAGE>With the power of the crystal, our village \nwill be safe from any monster...'
264601:'Now our village will be \neternally safe from \nthe monsters' menace.<PAGE>We owe everything to the \nsage. I am so thankful...'
264602:'That box...I think I've \nseen it before.<PAGE>Hmm...I can't really remember \nwhere, though.'
264603:'Look, I told you I don't \nremember where I saw it! \nYou sure are pesky.<PAGE>You don't remember what kind of shoes \npeople you passed in the street \nyesterday were wearing, do you?'
264604:'The sage says he's making a doohickey \nfrom some kind of crystal \nthing! Isn't that amazing?<PAGE>I forgot exactly what he's making. \nI don't really remember, but \nit was definitely amazing.'
264605:'What's so amazing about it? \nI already told you I don't remember! \nYou sure are pesky.<PAGE>Fine. Tell me what's so amazing \nabout the ocean, right now. \nYou can't, can you?'
264606:'Welcome, travelers, \nfrom so far away.<PAGE>I'm afraid our village \ndoesn't have anything \nparticularly special to offer...'
264607:'You're the ones who were \nfound unconscious, yes?<PAGE>Please make yourself \nat home here.'
264608:'You're friends \nof the sage?<PAGE>I didn't know. I was wondering \nwhat you had come to do \nin this tiny rural town.'
264609:'I'm so sorry we can't prepare \nanything special for you.<PAGE>Oh, yes. Have you seen the \nmountains to the north yet? \nThe scenery is very beautiful.'
264610:'Are you people from \nsomewhere else?<PAGE>Isn't it pretty here \nwith all the flowers \nblooming?'
264611:'Everyone from away says \nit's a pretty village.'
264612:'The desert? "Desert" like \nthe places that are all sand? \nYou came from a desert?<PAGE>Where is there a desert?'
264613:'I'm never even seen \na desert. You must \nhave come so far.'
264614:'You came from across the sea? \nYou must be so tired.<PAGE>You've been on a ship for \na long time, yes? What? No? \n"Blastia"? What's that?'
264615:'Huh? Apatheia? Is that \nsomething you eat?'
264616:'Apparently, if we construct one of \nthese "barriers" the monsters will stop \ncoming...but is it really safe?<PAGE>I suppose it must be, \nif the sage says it is.'
264617:'If the sage says it's safe, \nit's definitely safe.<PAGE>It would be simply outrageous \nto doubt the sage!'
264618:'This town is currently facing \na terrible crisis...the threat \nof giant monster attack...<PAGE>Everyone says we can accomplish anything \nwith the sage on our side, but is \nit all right to believe that...?'
264619:'This place is so peaceful, \nnobody here really knows \nthe value of doubt.<PAGE>I don't want to speak ill \nof the sage, either, but anything \ncan happen, right?'
264620:'Will the monsters really stay away \nfrom us because of a little pebble \nlike the clear ciel crystal?<PAGE>What if they just decide \nto take everything they \ncan and kill us all...?'
264621:'Don't get me wrong. I don't \nwant to doubt what the \nsage says, but...<PAGE>Those monsters can speak the human \ntongue...what if they're secretly \ninfluencing the sage...?'
264622:'...<PAGE>I don't know you...'
264623:'I can't talk...\nto strangers...'
264624:'...<PAGE>...*Burp*...'
264625:'Oh...just \ngo away...'
264626:'If you have a question, \nyou should ask the Sage.<PAGE>You can really depend on \nhim. Our current mayor is \ntoo young and unreliable.'
264627:'For a village chief, it's experience \nthat does the talking.<PAGE>The sage's wisdom truly \nspeaks volumes about how \nrich his experience is.'
264628:'Even if our town was perfectly safe \nfrom monsters, for the chief it \nwould still be a temporary fix.<PAGE>Perhaps we should \njust make the sage \nvillage chief...'
264629:'Yes, wouldn't making the sage \nour chief be a fine idea?<PAGE>I'll have to suggest it \nto the entire village.'
264630:'...By the way, how was\nLongchi doing?'
264631:'I always... always\nthink of him.<PAGE>I want to see him...'
264632:'Even now, I can see\nLongchi smile...<PAGE>I wonder when\nhe will come home...'
264633:'So, have you spoken\nto the Sage?<PAGE> He is a very nice person,\nso he may be willing\nto listen.'
264634:'My father died very suddenly and I \nfound myself governing this village, \nbut it isn't going well at all...<PAGE>I don't know what I would \ndo without the sage's help.'
264635:'The sage? He lives \nin the largest \nmansion.'
264636:'The truth is, the villagers' \nfaith in me has been wavering \nbecause of the sage's help...'
264637:'I'm not sure whether to be grateful or \nperturbed. It's a strange feeling...'
264638:'You're awake.\nAre you alright?<PAGE>You passed out by\nthe town entrance.'
264639:'You don't have to pay me.<PAGE>I brought you here\nin the first place.'
264640:'If you're looking for\nyour friends, they're\noutside already.'
264641:'Welcome, travelers. \nIt's 50 Gald per night...will \nyou stay?'
264643:'Thank you. Come \nback for a stay \nany time.'
264644:'Hmm? Are you all right already?<PAGE>You can rest as long \nas you need to.'
264645:'Don't you go getting yourselves \nknocked out again, you hear?<PAGE>Next time, I'll be \ncharging boarding \nfee! Tee-hee.'
264646:'You're all wearing such \nunusual clothes.<PAGE>We don't really see anything \nlike them around here. Did you \ncome from very far away?'
264647:'Is your food \nvery different \nas well?<PAGE>I'd love to hear \nsome recipes from \nyour hometowns.'
264648:'It's so hot...there's no shade \nat all...wearing this armor \nis like being on a grill...<PAGE>Stand guard here...? \nIt's torture...'
264649:'Our mission is to protect \nthe Ruins' Gate researchers \nfrom monsters, but...<PAGE>...I think the heat is going \nto kill us first...'
264650:'When will I be able \nto...go home...?<PAGE>They swore...a relief unit was \ncoming to take over for us...'
264651:'...Hey...it scares me to \nthink about this, but...<PAGE>You don't think this is a demotion \ntransfer...do you...?'
264652:'Ah! You are friends \nof Sir <STR>(FRE)?<PAGE>Please, ask me anything. \nI'll be happy to tell \nyou whatever I can!'
264653:'We are here investigating the \nruins, to determine why Captain \nAlexei came to these lands!<PAGE>However, with ruin excavation being \noutside our realm of expertise, we have \nemployed the help of Ruins' Gate!'
264654:'I'm ashamed to say we have a knight \ncollapsing every single day here.<PAGE>My partner fell unconscious as well, \nand was withdrawn back to Zaphias. He \nalways pushes himself too hard...'
264655:'The bizarre monster that \nappeared in the sky...what \ndo you suppose it is?<PAGE>It smells like an emergency situation \nto me, but with things as they are...we \nwouldn't be any help...'
264656:'The <STR>(FRE) Brigade is a \nranger unit, so we were able to \nsee so many different places...<PAGE>To be frank, standing guard \nhere isn't very fun at \nall. And it's so hot...'
264657:'Captain <STR>(FRE) may seem \nso kind, but he pushes \nhis men hard.<PAGE>Of course, you can't really \ncomplain when he's pushing \nhimself so hard, too.'
264658:'I haven't seen any other units \nat all lately, let alone \nour replacement unit...<PAGE>I wonder if all the other knights \nhave gone to deal with that \nstrange monster in the sky.'
264659:'I hear our captain \nis leading the way.<PAGE>Say...you don't suppose Sir <STR>(FRE) \nhas forgotten about us because \nof that monster, do you?'
264660:'I suppose things as strange as the Imperial \nKnights hiring us for something other \nthan blastia excavation do happen.<PAGE>We're supposed to be searching for clues as to some \nknight captain's motive. Do you think there's \nbeen some internal friction among the Knights?'
264661:'Whatever the reason, all we have \nto do is complete the investigation \nwe've been tasked with.<PAGE>The areas we have to search are \nrather harsh on this job, though. \nWe'll have to charge extra...'
264662:'Our initial investigations have \nrevealed one thing. These ruins \nare very mysterious...<PAGE>We believe they're some one thousand years \nold, but we haven't been able to identify \nthe reasons for this weathering.'
264663:'Even supposing it collapsed \ndue to a monster attack...the \nweathering is so unnatural.<PAGE>By the good name of \nRuins' Gate, we'll \nsolve this mystery!'
264664:'Hmm...these ruins \nare so intriguing.<PAGE>Judging by the condition of these stone \nfragments, I'd say this place is very old...perhaps \nas much as a thousand years.'
264665:'Looking at these fragments, I think \nit's safe to venture that this place \nwas destroyed by some outside force.<PAGE>There were no blastia yet, so \nperhaps the collapse was because \nof a monster attack...'
264666:'These ruins are so unusual...but \npeople definitely \nlived here.<PAGE>We've found several \ntraces of habitation.'
264667:'Pieces of buildings, too. Monsters \ndon't really have architectural \nskills, now do they?<PAGE>If I had to guess, \nI'd say this was a Kritya \nsettlement...'
264669,264671,264696,272472,272474,272476:'Our next show will be "The \nRighteous Bandits" as performed \nby the Dark Wings.<PAGE>Please be patient while \nthey finish getting \neverything in order.'
264670,264672,264695,272471,272473,272475:'The special stage\nis up ahead.<PAGE>You can watch plays\nand musicals there.'

264680:'Good times,\ngood times.<PAGE>This brings back\ngood memories.'
264681,274826:'Well... I just wanted to \nsay something like that. <PAGE>I feel so different \nin this costume.'
264682,274825:'Hmmm. A festival for lower class people \nis more fun than I was expecting. <PAGE>The world they live \nis too different\nfrom the world I live in...'
264683,274715:'I've seen their performance many times but \nI don't get tired of them at all! <PAGE>Ahh, \nI want to see their performance \nmore and more!!!'
264684,274716:'Do you guys know? \nThe Showtime, play Guild is \nhere for their performance! <PAGE>They are famous for \ntheir hard to get \ntickets. '
264685,274717:'There, there. It's there! \nHey, hurry up! <PAGE>Don't give me that weird look! '
264686,274718:'Here, here! \nThe (c) M sculpture \nis here! <PAGE>I wonder how many more times? \nTwo times? Three times? or \nHumm... '
264687:'I am going to wear this \nto the ball tonight. <PAGE>Well, it's only a Lantern \nFestival Dance though..'
264688,274833:'Tee-hee-hee. \nIsn't this dress \ncute! <PAGE>I secretly borrowed this from \nthe costume room. \nDon't tell anybody! '
264689,274819:'It's a double push! '
264690,274820:'It's very unprofitable...'
264691:'I want to try goldfish scooping,\nbut I also want some stir-fry\nnoodles, or maybe even some pizza...'
264692:'There's so much\nto choose from! ∀'
264693,274823:'This is made from\nthe finest material.<PAGE>What do you think?\nLooks good, huh? '
264694,274824:'Armor that covers the whole body \nis heavy, but armor like this \nis just the right weight. <PAGE>It makes me feel like I \nwant to kill monsters. '
264697:'An 8, huh?\nThat’s a tough one.<PAGE>It seems like it could\nbe a LOW, yet it could\nturn out to be a HIGH...'
264698,274830:'Huh? \nOf course, \nI am talking about double-up. <PAGE>There is a trap\nafter continuous successes. '
264699,274831:'You can bring \nyour handouts \nfor this test. <PAGE>You might think it makes it easy, but \nit means that it'll be that much harder. '

264711:'... I'm happy he built a \nhome for me and all, but...\nIt's just a tent...<PAGE>I wish it had been a log \ncabin or something, \nlike that one over there... '
264712:'A tent... Well, I guess it's \nbetter than camping out on the \nroad like the last few days. '

264779:'I feel kinda dizzy... I wonder \nif it's the drinks... <PAGE>But... \nIt feels a little... \ndifferent...'
264780:'Ugh... \nI'm pretty sure this... \nisn't a hangover...'
264781:'Our town, Halure...no, the Tree \nof Halure...grew this big by just \naccepting all that transpires. <PAGE>And I am sure it \nwill continue to do so.'
264782,270743:'I think the trick to living is \nto accept what comes, \nno matter what it may be.'
264783:'Something strange is going \non. Many people are \nreporting feeling sick. <PAGE>Healers are running \naround everywhere.'
264784:'I feel fine today, but I \nfelt terrible yesterday. <PAGE>I wonder how my \nbody will feel tomorrow...'
264785:'So, I heard the Don died? \nIt’s nonsense, if you ask me.<PAGE>So what if one of those big \nshots is dead? What’s the \nbig deal, anyway?'
264786:'Someone younger is bound to\ncome along and take the Don’s place\nand lead the Guilds anyway.<PAGE>I can’t be bothered with\nsomething as trifle as this.'
264787:'Rumor has it that Alexei\nhas seized control of Zaphias.<PAGE>Well, I saw this day coming.'
264788:'While we’re on this topic,\nI think that captain, Flynn\nis pretty fishy too.<PAGE>I don’t know. Let’s just\nsay I’ve got a hunch for\nthese things...'
264789:'The Imperial Knight's captain\n <STR>(FRE) put refugees on ship\nfrom Zaphias and headed south.<PAGE>I bet they're going to work those\nguys down to the bones.'
264790:'What happens to the\npeople in Zaphias has\nnothing to do with me!'
264791:'That hideous monster! It was\nhovering above Aspio, wasn't it?\nDid the mages put it there?'
264792:'I've always thought\nthose darn mages\nwere up to no good.'
264793:'That tower is close\nto Aspio, right?<PAGE>Those mages must\nbe up to something.'
264794:'They must have revived\nthat tower for some reason.<PAGE>Just like how they monopolized the\nblastia and got the Empire to back\nthem up. I don’t trust those guys.'
264795:'I don’t care who's plotting to\ndo what anymore.<PAGE>Either way, the Empire nor\nthe Guilds are going to do\nanything for us.'
264796:'I bet someone built that tower out of\nself-interest because they’ve got a score\nto settle with the Empire or the Guilds.'
264797:'The skies cleared up...Those mermen\nare roaming the sea whenever it’s sunny\nat this time of the year.'
264798:'If it rains, we can’t go out to sea.\nIf it’s sunny, we've got those mermen\nto deal with...*sigh*'
264799:'You know, I was a member\nof the pirate guild, Siren’s Fang.<PAGE>Then the boss died, and everyone\nwent their own ways...'
264800:'You’ve never heard of Siren’s \nFang? It was the guild of the \nking of the pirates, Aifread.'
264801:'An Imperial naval ship set\nout for Nordopolica a little\nwhile ago.<PAGE>At any rate, it’s tough for a guy\nlike me who’s just trying to make an\nhonest living to send a ship out to sea.'
264802:'So, Nordopolica has fallen\nunder the jurisdiction of the\nEmpire at last...<PAGE>I guess Dahngrest\nwill be next.'
264803:'Taking this many people\nout to sea? This is way\nover the capacity.<PAGE>I just hope we don’t sink...'
264804:'Those landlubbing knights!\nDon't underestimate the sea!'
264805:'I heard a lot of sunken treasures\nlie at the bottom of the ocean.<PAGE>I bet that palace on the\nsurface is no exception.'
264806:'But, all the attention from\nthe public takes away some\nof it's mysterious aura...'
264807:'I heard there’s a shiny\nnew continent to the\nnortheast of here.<PAGE>I’d like to go if I can only\nget a ship out to sea...'
264808:'A precursor to a volcanic eruption, maybe? \nOr perhaps the sea level dropped?<PAGE>This is why the seas are \nfull of such romance!'

264817:'I’ve seen quite a few men\nrow off to sea in a boat...<PAGE>None of them has\nbeen back since...'
264818:'Hmph! I bet they all found\nthemselves a nice girl in\na town somewhere!'
264819,264823:'I have the smiles of \nmany men tucked away \nin my memories...<PAGE>They all said I was \nsuch a lovely woman.'
264820,264824:'...You can't see that?\nUgh. How rude!'
264821:'No real man is a coward!<PAGE>Who were those losers just now?\nThey were running off crying!'
264822:'A guy that can laugh in the\nface of danger! Now that’s\nthe kind of man I like!<PAGE>What? Well, I’m still\non the market!'
264825:'Our research is falling behind\nbecause Mordio is not here.'
264826:'Will you guys be\ndone soon?<PAGE>I need Mordio back to\nhelp with the research.'
264827:'Yeager’s dead... What’s going \nto happen to Ruin’s Gate?<PAGE>I guess you don’t have\nthe answer to that...'
264828:'That still gives me\na reason to slack off...'
264829:'Everyone calm down.<PAGE>Nothing is going to threaten the\nEmpire as long as the barrier and\nthe knights are around.'

264845,275137:'But you know, one wrong \nstep and I might have followed \nCommandant Alexei too.'
264846,275138:'I was in the Royal \nGuard at that time. <PAGE>I received an order, \nand I just followed \nout of blind loyalty.'

264848,275140:'Hmph... I say, I cannot abide \nrelying on you to save us! \nI say, we will repay this debt!'
264849,275141:'I say, Captain Schwann will \nreplace that traitorous dog, \nAlexei, as Commandant!'
264850,275142:'When Commandant Alexei took \nover the castle, I wasn't sure \nwhether or not to follow him. <PAGE>Now I know I did the \nright thing by believing \nin Lieutenant Leblanc!'

There's a guy \nwith you that looks just \nlike Captain Schwann.<PAGE>He said to put him \nin jail, so I did. \nKinda wierd, huh?<PAGE>Oh yeah, I caught \nthat guy before, too. \nSo it was like...<PAGE>Sorry. \nI'll shut up now.'
264854,275146:'The Royal Guard were the \nbest of the best, hand \npicked by Alexei himself.<PAGE>How could it become \njust a cult to worship \nAlexei...?'
264855,275147:'Even <STR>(FRE), the acting \ncommandant, got \ntricked by Alexei.'
264856,275148:'Most of the Royal Guard \nstayed in the capital\ninstead of going to Zaude.<PAGE>But they got branded \nas traitors anyway. \nThey're hating life now.'
264857,275149:'My friend was one of them. \nPoor guy.'

264859,275151:'The Knights should always be the \nprimary servants of the people!'
264860,275152:'Uhhh... I feel sick... \nI am so done with \nbeing a knight...'
264861,275153:'And with what Alexei\ndid, nobody respects \nKnights anymore.'
264862,275154:'Well, I guess joining a group \nlike this and getting so much power \nwould make anyone crazy. <PAGE>I mean, I don't even know about \nActing Commandant <STR>(FRE). \nThat position, as young as he is...?'
264863,275155:'<STR>(FRE)... \nHe's so innocent. \nPoor thing. <PAGE>I'm afraid that won't \nlast very long...'

264865,275157:'I'll pass on working with \nlowlifes that'll stab you \nin the back anytime.'
264866,275158:'I don't know \nwhat to believe. <PAGE>I was brought up thinking the \nKnights were just group \nthat protected the country.'
264867,275159:'What is justice?<PAGE>I wonder if I can \nlive by my own \nsense of justice.'

264870,270577:'No matter what sort of \ncrisis we may face, I believe \nthere is always a solution.'
264871,270578:'Why, you ask? \nWell, we've survived \nthis long, haven't we?'

264874,275378:'I thought this city would \nbe okay as long as \nthere was a barrier. <PAGE>Maybe we relied \ntoo much on blastia.'
264875,275379:'We should have realized it \nthen, but... Oh well. We'll \nkeep fighting on.'
264876,270746:'The falling flowers \nare ever-present, but \nnever twice the same. <PAGE>"Petals flutter upon the wind, \nnever lingering long..."'
264877,270747:'...So it is with all the \nflocks of man on earth.'
264878:'Maybe illness does \nfollow the mind...<PAGE>You can think your \nway to health, right? <PAGE>...Or not. \nAm I sick? \nI feel terrible.'
264879:'Illness follows the mind... \nI hear thinking that way \nwill cure almost anything. <PAGE>Yeah, that's a lie.\n'
264880:'If I could use high blastia magic, \nI'd blow those monsters away \nin one shot...<PAGE>O-of course, \nit's only a fantasy...'

264887,270757:'We must simply \nlive as ourselves. \nThat is happiness.'
264888:'...I don't feel too good... \nI wonder why...<PAGE>It all started after \nthat tower appeared...'

264895,275177:'I feel so sorry for a \nfriend of mine who \nwas late escaping... <PAGE>Why couldn't \nI help him...?'
264896,275178:'It was horrible... \nSo many people...<PAGE>The smoke still followed us, \nno matter how much we ran. \nI can't believe I'm still alive.'
264897,275179:'I can still see the \nterrible light, every \ntime I close my eyes. <PAGE>I don't think I'll \never forget this.'

264903,275185:'I'm done with the capital. \nDone. I'm leaving it \nfor better lands.'
264904,275186:'This town's boring. \nThere's nothing to do. <PAGE>Flowers? You seen one, \nyou seen them all. \n*Sigh* Booooring...'

264910:'I haven't seen them. They \nhaven't come this way. There's \nnothing up ahead either.'
264913:'Why don't you people use \nyour blastia to kill that monster?'
264914,270799:'What's the point of having \nblastia if you don't use \nthem at a time like this?'
264915,270800:'If you guys won't take \ncare of the Adephagos I'll \ntake it out myself!'

265592,271213:'Hey...you hear this one?<PAGE>They say a tower shot up from the \nmountains on the other continent! \nCan you believe that?'
265593,271214:'Can you believe that?'
265596,271325:'It doesn't matter where \nwe run anymore...'
265598,271355:'Even in times like these, \nwe can't keep from \nhunting monsters.<PAGE>It's fate, I tell ya.'
265599,271356:'Monster are evil. Dangerous. \nWe must eradicate them \nat all costs.'
265600,271407:'Hmph, I guess \nwe got no choice \nbut to cooperate.<PAGE>But I wonder how \nlong that'll last.'
265601,271408:'Well, we'll just \nhave to do \nwhat we can.'
265602:'The Empire just needs \nto be wiped off the \nface of the world.<PAGE>The people of this town \nwill protect their own!'
265603:'A new age will come when we \nget rid of the Empire and \nchange how the world runs!'
265606:'We should be thankful \nwe escaped with our lives. '
265607:'It must be divine judgment.'
265608:'I feel like I'm on some \nkind of adventure!'
265609:'But I'm really, \nreally tired... '
265610:'All my wife does \nis complain. \nI'm tired of it.<PAGE>I wish she'd lay \noff it for a while. '
265611:'It's not like I'm \nhappy either...<PAGE>I read the "Zaphias Rangers" \nserial all the time. I want to \nknow what's gonna happen next... '
265612:'Ugh! \nI'm all dirty. \nIt's gross.<PAGE>I'm starving! \nI want some candy! \nIt's hot! '

270025,270027,270029:'I think I was in the bath for too long. \nI feel a bit flushed.∀'
270026,270028,270030:'Like your girls fresh \nout of the bath, huh? \nYeah, I've seen your type before.'
270031,270033,270035:'There's nothin' finer than \ntaking a bath under the nighttime sky! <PAGE>A cool drink, a little moon gazin'... \nIt's just the best!!'
270032,270034,270036:'There's also that first drink after \nya get out, though. Wouldn't be a \nproper bath without that now, would it?<PAGE>Heh, guess I do my \nfair share of drinkin'.'
270038,270040,270042:'Hey! All these drinks \nare for grown-ups...'
270044:'There was a big bang, and \nthe water just starting shooting \nout, and the fountain broke! <PAGE>I'm scared, <STR>(YUR)! \nHelp us...'
270048:'Repede!♪ \nI love your big ol' ears!∀'
270061:'It looks like the weirdness in the \nsky cleared up, but some houses in \nthe lower quarter got messed up.<PAGE>The Knights won't do anything \nfor us, so I guess we'll take \ncare of things ourselves.'
270063:'The monsters can get in \nwith the barrier down...<PAGE>Here in Zaphias, we have the \nKnights to keep them at bay, but \nwhat are the other towns doing?'
270067:'Welcome! This shop stays open, \nno matter what. Don't want to \ninconvenience people, you know!'
270070:'Thanks again! \nStop by any time, even if \nit's just to say hello.'
270071:'Hey, long time no see! \nTake your time looking around!'

270087:'If it isn't the wanted man!♪<PAGE>You've got that big bounty \non your head... Maybe you \nwant us to catch you?'

270090:'The <STR>(FRE) Defense \nForce is really \njust a fan club.<PAGE>It sounded like fun, \nso I joined too!♪'
270091:'To think the aque blastia \nhad just been repaired! \nThey must've done a shoddy job. <PAGE>I even used money \nI'd saved for my wedding \nto get it fixed...'
270096:'That blastia breaking was bad, \nbut it brought the people of the \nlower quarter together.<PAGE>Even my girl says \nshe's counting on me... \nHeh heh.'
270097:'Wow, <STR>(FRE)'s amazing! \nYou hear he made captain?<PAGE>He's the pride of \nthe lower quarter.'
270100:'What, now the barrier blastia's \nbroken? At least the monsters \nhaven't invaded yet.<PAGE>We have to protect this \ncity. The lower quarter\nis my only home.'
270108:'I wonder what will happen with \nour water. We can't cook, clean, \nor even bathe without it.'
270110:'What are you going to do \nnow? <STR>(FRE)'s doing his \nduty as a Knight, but you...'
270113:'They say <STR>(FRE)'s doing a great \njob with the Knights. It's all the \nlower quarter can talk about.'
270114:'You never change, do \nyou <STR>(YUR)? Always letting \n<STR>(FRE) take the lead.<PAGE>I hope you'll show us what \nyou're really made of one \nof these days, <STR>(YUR).'
270126:'You were in the castle, right? \nDid you see <STR>(FRE)?<PAGE>Tell <STR>(FRE) the lower quarter's \nin trouble!'
270127:'<STR>(YUR)! I saw your \nwanted poster.<PAGE>I can't believe there's \na bounty on you! You're \nfamous in the Empire!'
270129:'<STR>(FRE)'s a captain now! \nHe's amazing!<PAGE>And I know <STR>(FRE)'ll keep \nworking for the lower \nquarter, even as a captain.'
270133:'Great... Just great... \nThe lower quarter's a mess.'
270134:'I wonder if <STR>(FRE) will rebuild \nthings if we ask. I mean, \n<STR>(FRE)'s really important now!<PAGE><STR>(YUR), go and ask \nfor us!'
270138:'All the members of the <STR>(FRE)\nDefense Force followed \n<STR>(FRE) to his new town.<PAGE>They just don't get it! If they \nreally knew <STR>(FRE), they'd stay \nhere in the lower quarter.'
270145:'After the incident with magistrate \nRagou, the Council's reputation \nhas taken a huge hit. <PAGE>Now the balance between the Council and \nthe Imperial Knights is wavering... \nWhat will become of our Empire?'
270148:'Onions, carrots, and...\nIs this crate full of bottles? <PAGE>Lucky I noticed, I was just about \nto kick this thing away and \nshatter them all. That was close!'
270152:'You should visit \nyour old room \nonce in a while. <PAGE>If you don't take care of it, \nthe dust in there \nwill start forming strata!'
270155:'Halt! \nIf you go any further, \nyou'll leave the city. <PAGE>The world outside Zaphias' barrier \nis swarming with monsters. It's too \ndangerous for you equipped like that.'
270157:'An emergency order \nhas been issued to \nseal off the capital. <PAGE>None may pass.'
270164:'Commandant Alexei rode off \non a monster somewhere. <PAGE>Maybe I should follow him...'
270166:'If Commandant Alexei truly brought \nthis disaster upon us, it is the Knights' duty \nto protect the city with our very lives.'
270167:'I don't know if our strong defense \nmade them give up or what, but monsters \nhaven't attacked as much lately. <PAGE>You can rest easy. \nZaphias is a safe \nplace to live.'
270171:'Wait, wait a moment! \nHas the good sir seen my work yet? \nIt burns with a palpable passion!'
270172:'Your wanted poster. Your wanted \nposter, good sir! It was none other \nthan I who painted it! <PAGE>You're a very distinctive young man, \nso I remembered it well. \nIt is a masterwork, is it not?'
270173:'Ahh, the hero returns! Your bounty \nkeeps going up and up, and \nI cannot but be filled with joy. <PAGE>Painting your wanted poster \nwas quite worthwhile indeed.'
270174:'Would that you would do even more \nevil and become an arch-villain to \nforever leave his name in history!'
270175:'The sky is the color of the water \nafter I paint. Landscapes aren't my \nspecialty, but ohhh, this color...'
270177:'This time it was a \nphoenix! A phoenix was \nflying over Zaphias! <PAGE>But it was struck \ndown by that uncanny \naurora in the sky!'
270209:'Not only is Captain <STR>(FRE) kind, \nhe's so good-looking!∀ <PAGE>All the girls of \nZaphias have had their eyes \non him for a while.'
270216:'It's been a while now since \nI left the Krityan city and \ncame to live in the capital. <PAGE>It's so quiet. \nIt's really nice here.'
270217:'Living comfortably \nhelps enrich \nyour heart, too. <PAGE>If you've got a stable \nlivelihood, doesn't that \nput your mind at ease?'
270220:'I think it's good that \nthe Empire manages \nthe blastia.<PAGE>People tend to forget that blastia \nare managed because they're \nsuch a part of everyday life.'
270221:'Regulating private possession \nof blastia is a simple and \neffective way to prevent accidents.'
270256:'I helped hunt monsters \nin the town where \nI used to live. <PAGE>We had seasons when our \nbarrier would weaken and \nmonsters would get inside.'
270257:'Here in Zaphias you have the \nImperial Knights, so I can't \neven help with defense...<PAGE>What else is there \nthat I can do?'
270263:'The knight usually guarding \nthe lower quarter is a \ndependable, loyal person. <PAGE>He's in the Schwann Brigade. The \nuseless ones are in the Cumore Brigade. \nThe commanders make the difference.'
270265:'I know using bodhi blastia \ncauses harmful effects, but we \ncan't think about that now.'
270273:'I met <STR>(FRE) before he \nwas a captain, you know. \nHe's a really nice guy! <PAGE>When I join the Knights \nI'm gonna be in the <STR>(FRE) Brigade!'
270274:'Salt, check. Sugar, check. Did\nI forget anything...? Ah, such \na lovely day for shopping.'
270275:'Oh...are you from the \nlower quarter, young man? <PAGE>Tee-hee...what a handsome \nyoung figure. I got a bonus \nwith my shopping today!♪'
270278:'Hey, why don't you join the \n<STR>(FRE) Defense Force, too?<PAGE>Hee-hee.  I'm the founder \nof the <STR>(FRE) Defense \nForce, you know.'
270280:'The barrier's gone! <PAGE>What'll happen if that strange \nmonster that showed up in \nthe sky attacks Zaphias...?'
270281:'I pray they fix the \nbarrier blastia soon...'
270282:'They say young <STR>(FRE) built a \nnew town in Hypionia.<PAGE>Will you be joining <STR>(FRE)\nthere, <STR>(YUR)?'
270288:'The Knights are the sword of justice. \nThe shield of the weak. \nWe can retreat not a step.'
270298:'There was a huge \nearthquake to the north!<PAGE>This is it. The end of the world... \nIt doesn't matter if a monster eats you \nor the world ends. It's all the same!'
270299:'I hope when the world \nends, it happens so fast \nwe don't even notice.<PAGE>I don't want \nit to hurt...'
270303:'I'm gonna go to the new town \nand have Captain <STR>(FRE)\nteach me how to use a sword! <PAGE>I'm gonna be a knight just \nlike Captain <STR>(FRE)!'
270304:'Th-th-th-the barrier \ndisappeared! <PAGE>Monsters are going to attack! \n How come we have \nto stay in the city?!'
270306:'This lull in monster attacks is \nonly temporary. <PAGE>It's so obvious they'll be back to \nattack again in a huge swarm!'
270307:'It's all over, it's all over! \nThe capital! My life!\nOhhh... <PAGE>Why did I ever \nbecome a knight...'
270308:'Only nobles and royalty are \nfit to be on this level.<PAGE>It's not really a \nplace for people from \nthe lower quarter.'
270309:'I can't really say anything, \nthough. I was raised in the \nlower quarter, too.<PAGE>Being up here really \nmakes me miss the \nwarmth of the lower quarter...'
270311:'The barrier blastia's \npretty huge, too. So big, it \nkind of numbs your senses.'
270313:'Nighttime entry \nis not permitted.'
270315:'There's a suspicious person! \nArrest him immediately!'
270316:'This is the heart \nof the Empire. <PAGE>If you want to get in, you \neither have to be an Imperial Knight \nor be caught as a criminal. '
270317:'Why are you loitering in \nfront of the castle at this hour? \nDo you want to get arrested?'
270318:'This is the hope of the \nEmpire, Zaphias Castle. <PAGE>We, the Imperial Knights, have \nguarded the fire of hope through \nwind and rain. Well, sort of. '
270319:'I'm not impressed \nthat you've brought along \nchildren at this hour. <PAGE>You'll be suspected \nof kidnapping. '
270321:'What is a \nnon-noble doing here \nat this hour? <PAGE>You're not the thief that \neveryone's talking about?'
270323:'Don't stand behind me. <PAGE>I cannot ensure your life \nif you stand behind me. '
270324:'The only reason you can walk \naround at night is because of the \nstreet light blastia. <PAGE>We also benefit from \nbarrier blastia and aque \nblastia in Zaphias. '
270325:'Appointments to the \nemperor's advisory body are \ndetermined by our committee... <PAGE>But I really haven't \ndone much.'
270326:'The entire council \nhas been bad mouthed and is in \nchaos due to a certain magistrate, <PAGE>even though I'm \nsuch a good person...'
270327:'I heard that his accomplice \ninterfered with the core \nof Zaphias's blastia. <PAGE>Handling the blastia \nwithout the proper knowledge \ncould lead to disaster. '
270328:'The Commadant barricaded \nin the castle is the \nsource of the problem. <PAGE>We councilors were also \noverrun by the Knights \nand chased to the castle. '
270329:'You'll be punished for \nmishandling the blastia. <PAGE>Do you think the Commandant \nwill be all right?'
270330:'What's going on? It looked \nlike the Sword Stair formula \nshot something really far away.'
270331:'I can't stand the abuse \nthe blastia are taking... <PAGE>We're the ones that \ndetermine who gets \nblastia and who doesn't.'
270332:'The path we're on will be \ndestroyed... It's too late. \nThere is no other way.'
270333:'The appearance of the \nAdephagos is a countdown \nto destruction. <PAGE>The history of \nKritya shows this. '
270334:'The thing that appeared to \nthe north looks like the \ntop floor of the tower. <PAGE>We can't construct such a high \ntower with today's technology.'
270335:'Is that tower from \nthe Geraios Civilization...? <PAGE>But what for...?'
270336,270338:'Hey! Could you please \nnot suddenly disturb me?!'
270337:'I've been on the lookout, \nwatching the mansion to \nconfirm the rumors. <PAGE>I'll immediately call \nfor the knights if a thief \nenters the premises.'
270339:'I succeeded in \nreporting to the knights \nthe other day. <PAGE>I've been \non the lookout \nfor any thieves. '
270340:'I think the poor are causing \ntoo much of an uproar just because \ntheir taxes have increased a little. <PAGE>I guess those slow-witted people \nthat can't even put their assets \nto use have no choice.'
270341:'If you can't buy \nbread, just eat cake. <PAGE>It's so sad that something \nas simple as that \ndoesn't get around.'
270342:'D-d-don't scare \nme like that...'
270343:'Naturally, you would come \nto say hello when you're moving \ninto the neighbourhood. <PAGE>I'm waiting here ready \nto give you advice. '
270344:'I'm on the watch \nwith the lady next door \nto look out for thieves'
270345:'I heard there's a reward \nfor finding thieves. <PAGE>It's just 10,000 Gald, but \nI guess money is money.'
270346:'Recently, a lot of poor people \nhave been trying garner sympathy \nby bringing their pets.'
270347:'I won't fall for your sob \nstory about your dog. '
270348,270352,270354:'You've been sitting around \nuntil this late hour... \nOh well...'
270349,270353:'You came to \ndemand water, right? \nAre you statisfied? <PAGE>What a shameless man.'
270350:'If the poor loiter around \nhere, they'll be arrested \nby the Knights. <PAGE>Well, I'm the one \nthat'll notify them. '
270351:'I'll accept the commotion caused \nby the thieves during the afternoon \nthe other day as dignified. <PAGE>On the other hand, \nI think those who sneak \nin at night as vulgar.'
270355:'You can at least \ngo around groveling \nto gather coins.'
270356:'People say it's dangerous \nto go walking alone at night, \nbut it's hard to resist. <PAGE>Moonlight strolls... \nAhhh, so beautiful. '
270357:'Look around at the capital\nat night, and you can just \nfeel the peace and quiet.'
270358:'You're collecting \nGald at this hour? <PAGE>I've heard that Gald is easier \nto find at night since the city \nlights shine off the coins. '
270359:'The tourists that come \nto see the capital throw \nGald into that lake.'
270360:'I saw the dragon \nwhen there were problems \nwith the capital's aer. <PAGE>That was probably \nan Entelexeia.'
270361:'I wonder if that dragon came \nto eat the capital's aer. '
270362:'I saw someone that looked \nlike the Commandant of the \nKnights leaving the city. <PAGE>He flew away!'
270363:'What really happened \nin the castle?'
270364:'I see you a lot, but you \ndon't really work in the \nroyal quarter, do you?'
270365:'There will be no looting. \nDo you hear me? '
270366:'Is that tower a hand of salvation \nfrom the heavens, or a \nhammer borne of the earth? <PAGE>Heh heh. \nI'm a pretty good \npoet, aren't I?'
270367:'Is that a tower of \nhope or depair?'
270368:'It's like those people in \nthe underworld are crowded \ninto a little, tiny hole. <PAGE>Ahh. \nI want to crush \nthem so badly...'
270369:'Squish... <PAGE>Well, just kidding.'
270370:'The underworld \nis newer than \nthe royal quarter. <PAGE>They may have status \nnow, but they were nothing \na few generations back.'
270371:'We'll soon have to put \nthem in their place. <PAGE>We should make that clear. \nJust a few squishes...'
270372:'A thief entered the mansion \nduring the evacuation! <PAGE>It was a looter, I'm telling \nyou! I can't let that go!'
270373:'Do not disrupt \nthe guards. <PAGE>They'll arrest any thief that \nuses the chaos with the destroyed \nbarrier to try something funny. '
270374:'The knights barricaded \nthere aren't listening \nto anyone! <PAGE>They only provide half-hearted \nanswers and have no intension \nof responding properly.'
270375:'What in the world? \nThey're tax thieves!'
270376:'There were a few things \nmissing when I vacated \nthe mansion for a while. <PAGE>A thief must \nhave broken in.'
270377:'I'll give up on the stolen goods. \nI don't think the Knights \nhave time for that. <PAGE>That would only matter \nif you were alive. '
270378:'Actually, the ladies here followed \nthat knight for an entire day \nand have not stopped complaining. <PAGE>The Knights are \ngreatly worried... \nI feel sorry for them. '
270379:'Keep this conversation a secret \nfrom the other ladies.'
270380:'What the... \nIt's creepy... '
270381:'A part of that sky\nmonster fell somewhere.<PAGE>It was really huge.\nI hope there wasn't any\ntown where it fell.'
270382:'There now is a tower\nwhere it used to be\nthe northen mountains.'
270383:'What could that be?<PAGE>I've never heard of anything \nlike that before!.'
270384:'Huh? \nWhat about \nyour blastia? <PAGE>I don't care \nabout blastia. \nDon't waste my time.'
270385:'I'm telling you, \nI don't know anything \nabout blastia.<PAGE>If your blastia broke, \njust buy a new one!'
270386:'I've got a serious problem. \nDon't bother me.'
270387:'I'm trying to figure out what to \ndo with all my money. I have more \nthan I know what to do with. <PAGE>Huh? You want some? Show me \nyour best antlionz impression \nand just I might consider it.'
270392:'Zaphias' barrier has disappeared! \nIt must be repaired immediately!'
270396:'I came back to Zaphias\nbecause I heard it was safe. <PAGE>But the barrier has \ndisappeared, and there's \na monster in the sky.'
270397:'Will that beast be in the sky \nno matter where we run? <PAGE>Perhaps Zaphias is \nthe safest place. \nWe have the Knights here.'
270404:'Someone do something! \nWhat the hell is that thing?! \nWhat happened to the barrier?!'
270405:'I'm a noble! \nI'll give you all the \nmoney you want! <PAGE> Someone! Anyone! \nGet rid of that thing!'
270408:'Security's light in the royal quarter\nbecause it's relatively safe. <PAGE>The lower quarter and citizen quarter\nwould get attacked first. \nEveryone's guarding those areas.'
270409:'Of course, the nobles are \nall worked up saying we're \nnot protecting them. <PAGE>That's why I hate the royal \nquarter post... It's easier \ndealing with the monsters.'
270464,270511:'The guilds aren't just \nanti-Empire organizations, they're \nautonomous groups seeking freedom...<PAGE>...Or so this guy here tells me.'
270469,270516:'<STR>(YUR)! Come on, you \ncan't be that slow.<PAGE>Ted left ages ago. \nStop twiddling your thumbs, \n<STR>(YUR), and get a move on!'

270478,270525:'You and your friends \nfixed that weird sky, right <STR>(YUR)? <PAGE>Now we can go out and play! \nThank you...tee-hee!♪'
270479,270526:'Are you gonna leave again, <STR>(YUR)? <PAGE>Everyone's gonna work together \nand fix the town back up, \nso come back soon!'
270480,270527:'<STR>(YUR), are you feeling down?'

270483,270530:'This is your home to come back to, \n<STR>(YUR). I'll always have something \nnice and hot ready for you to eat!'
270484:'<STR>(FRE) came to tell us \nabout the danger in Zaphias.<PAGE>He evacuated the citizens to the \nport town. I swear, <STR>(FRE)'s the \nonly one actually doing his job.'
270485:'That weird thing with \nthe sky seems to have fixed itself.<PAGE>The evacuees won't come \nback for a while, but we gotta \nfix up the lower quarter.'
270487:'The Knights are handling the \ncity's security. <PAGE>We should be thankful they took charge... \nwithout the barrier, we're \nhelpless against monster attacks.'
270489:'They say <STR>(FRE) led all the \nrefugees to build a new town.<PAGE>I'm sure that \nwasn't his intention...\nIt just happened, right?'
270490:'When everything's back to \nnormal,  <STR>(FRE) will come \nback to Zaphias.<PAGE>He's from the \nlower quarter, after all.'
270494:'Wait...it was you!<PAGE>Real men have short hair! \nGo cut it! It's so confusing!'
270495:'Drink up, don't let \nthe drink drink you up!<PAGE>Ha ha ha ha ha ha! \nYeah, yeah... \nI know, I know!'
270496:'I ain't drunk. \nAin't drunk  at all! \nHa ha ha ha ha...ugggh...'
270503:'The Empire may have the power \nin Zaphias, but it's different \noutside the city.<PAGE>There are towns in which the guilds are \nmuch more influential.'
270504:'The guilds started as vocational \norganizations formed by people who \ntook issue with the Empire's rule.<PAGE>That feeling of opposition \nremains today, and the guilds\ndon't like the Empire at all.'
270532:'It's as if all light \nleft Halure when the \nTree withered.'
270538,270638:'Hey! Listen! \nThe Tree of Halure died!'
270542:'How I loved to gaze \nat the blossoms...'
270544,270668:'There must be some way \nto bring the Tree of \nHalure back to life...'
270545,270669:'First we have to \ninvestigate what made it \nwither in the first place.'
270549,270654:'Who knew that the darkness \ncould be so terrifying...?'
270550,270696:'Can't we repair the \nblastia somehow?'
270551:'I suppose we'll just have \nto sleep on this problem.'
270552,270704,270706,270708,270710,270752,270754:'This is our mayor's house.'
270553,270705,270707,270709,270711,270753,270755:'I think the mayor's inside.'
270554:'If you follow the hill \nup, you'll arrive \nat the Tree of Halure. <PAGE>Of course, it's dead now...'
270555:'The Tree stood solidly \nthere at night... \nIt was really eerie.'
270580,270585:'We can't keep doing this... \nWe have to prepare for \nthe monsters' night attacks...'
270582:'The fleeting blossoms of a heart \nyearning for tomorrow. The midnight \nstorm that fails to blow...'
270587:'Morning's for thinking, Day's \nfor action. Evening's for eating. \nNight's for sleeping. <PAGE>It may sound plain, \nbut this sort of life \nmakes me the most happy.'
270590:'Back then, I wished so many \ntimes that I had died... <PAGE>But I don't think that now.'
270591:'I cannot die until I've repaid my \ndebt to the people here. They gave \nme hope when all hope was lost. <PAGE>Repaying their kindness \nwill probably take the \nrest of my life.'
270608:'The Tree of Halure is also \nquite beautiful at night.'
270612:'When winter has come, \nspring will follow after... <PAGE>When night has fallen, \na new day soon will dawn...'
270617:'How could the Tree have \ncome back to life?!'
270618:'A dead tree blooming again... \nI've never seen that \nin my entire life...'
270634:'When the faint white of the Halure\nblossoms illuminate the darkness \nof the night, I feel at peace. '
270635:'I dislike noise, but I \ndislike living without a sense \nof security even more. <PAGE>I'd especially like to \nhave it quiet at night.  '
270636:'Some people get so loud when \nthey view the blosoms at night. \nI can't stand them. '
270640:'Hey! Listen! \nThe Tree of Halure came \nback to life!'
270641:'Hey, mister, how did the \nTree come back to life?'
270642:'Hey! Listen! \nThe Imperial Knights \ncame to town!'
270644:'Hey! Listen! \nThere was some big \ntrouble in Dahngrest!'
270646:'We're going to \ndrink all night long!'
270647:'We're going again to \ngaze at Halure tonight. \nThis is our fifth night!'
270648:'We're drinking \nagain tonight!'
270650:'Drinking morning and night while \nflower viewing... I'm way past \njust relaxing under the flowers...'
270656:'Being able to sleep peacefully \nat night is no small thing.'
270657:'Do you think the Knights will \npost guards at night as well?'
270658:'If they did, \nour defense certainly \nwould be tough.'
270660:'I don't know who defeated \nthe monster... But, we're \nsafe at night. '
270661:'Time is something that can \nturn to gold or lead depending \non how you use it. <PAGE>Just like a night drinking will \nturn out very differntly than \na quiet evening with a book.'
270662:'The Tree of Halure is constantly \ngrowing ever so slightly larger.'
270663:'The best time for pondering the \nevents of one's life is at night.'
270664:'The dark of night finally becomes morning. \nThe rising sun will eventually sink, \nand night will fall again.<PAGE>Don't you think this cycle \nresembles life itself?'
270665:'If one wishes for happiness \ntoday, they need gaze only upon \nthe blossoms of Halure.<PAGE>However, if one desires a lifetime \nof happiness, they must care \ndeeply for the Tree of Halure.'
270666:'It's nights like this \nthat I recall all the old sayings \nwe have here in Halure.'
270670:'The Tree of Halure is \nback in gorgeous bloom.'
270671:'I wonder what we can do \nto stop it from ever \nwithering again?'
270672:'The Imperial Knights \ncame from Zaphias.'
270673:'I wish they would just \nleave this town alone.'
270674:'Making a friend of \ntime enriches one's life.<PAGE>Do you know what \nthat saying means?'
270675:'Plant good seeds, water and \nfertilize them well, and keep \nweeds and insects away...<PAGE>...But the most important thing \nof all is to wait patiently. \nIt's that simple.'
270683:'I guess we're not \nthat different!'
270684:'I don't want to die. But... <PAGE>If I'm going die sometime, \nI want to be okay with it. '
270685:'The reason this town is \nsafe is because of the blastia. '
270686:'There is no end to research. <PAGE>You finish researching one \nthing, and there's something \nelse waiting to be studied.'
270688:'Sure, you can see the \nflowers of Halure with \nyour eyes, but... <PAGE>It'd be wonderful to feel \nthe flowers with your heart...'
270690:'We pray to the Tree \nof Halure before \nwe go to sleep. <PAGE>We always thank it for \nkeeping us safe today...'
270691:'I wonder how many \nlong years the Tree \nof Halure has endured?'
270692:'We don't realize the \nvalue of everyday things \nuntil they're lost.'
270693:'We had taken the Tree of Halure\nfor granted. But now, we must \nbe more thankful for it.'
270698:'I'm so relieved the \nblastia was repaired.'
270699:'The people of this town \ncare for the Tree deeply.'
270700:'It may be a blastia, but that \ndoesn't mean it's permanent.'
270701:'I ask you folk to care \nfor the Tree as well.'
270702:'In this town, there is not \na single person who does not \ncare for the Tree of Halure.'
270703:'To us, the Tree is as an \numbrella on a rainy day.'
270712:'If you follow the hill \nup, you'll arrive \nat the Tree of Halure.<PAGE>Of course, it's dead now...'
270714:'If you follow the hill \nup, you'll arrive \nat the Tree of Halure.<PAGE>It has been restored \nto beautiful life!'
270716:'If you follow the \nhill up, you'll arrive \nat the Tree of Halure.<PAGE>Three types of flowers \nbloom upon it...oh, do you \nalready know about them?'
270717:'The harmonea flower, \nthe luluria flower, and \nthe renen flower. <PAGE>Those are the three.'
270718:'Even the mighty Tree \nof Halure isn't immortal.'
270719:'We're all the same. \nWe're all alive.'
270720:'There are no \nguarantees in life...'
270721:'That's the only \nreal guarantee!'
270727:'Halure will remain at \npeace as long as the \nflowers continue to bloom.'
270729:'Every morning upon rising, \nI go to pray at the \nTree of Halure.<PAGE>"Please keep us \nsafe today," I ask...'
270731:'But the Tree of \nHalure endures it all, \nin infinite patience.'
270732:'It hurts, "I'm tired", \n"I've had enough" ...You'll \nnever save anyone that way.'
270733:'Thankfully, the Tree of \nHalure does that for us.'
270734:'Grandpa says the Tree \nof Halure was around even \nwhen he was a little boy...'
270735:'I wonder how long \nthe Tree's been here?'
270736:'A bunch of dirty \npeople came to town.<PAGE>Is that what \nthey call "refugees"?'
270737:'I wish they'd \nall just leave.'
270738:'I think the flowers are beautiful \nbecause they bloom with every \nlast ounce of their strength.'
270739:'I hope I can be as \nbeautiful as these \nflowers some day.'
270740:'I think the flowers are so \nbeautiful because they're silent.'
270741:'I wish people could \nbe the same way...'
270742:'Our town, Halure...no, the Tree of Halure\ngrew as large as it did by \nsimply accepting all that transpires.<PAGE>And I am sure it will \ncontinue to do so.'
270744:'Are you afraid of \nbeing hurt? So am I.<PAGE>But look at the Tree of \nHalure...can't you feel something?'
270745:'Squirrels may gnaw at its \nbuds and insects may \nchew off its leaves...<PAGE>Yet through it all, the \nTree still manages to produce \nsuch wonderful flowers.'
270748:'What happened here \nwill surely happen countless \ntimes again.'
270749:'As long as man's true \nnature remains the <PAGE>same, this will all reoccur.\nThe greatest opposition to man's \nreasoning is always his nature.'
270750:'Don't get all happy when \nyour luck's good, and don't \nget all down when it's bad.'
270751:'Tomorrow's flowers \nwill bloom tomorrow...'
270758:'Nothing so simple as \nfate ruins our lives.'
270759:'We always ruin our own.'
270760:'This is the town of Myorzo. \nOnly Kritya live here, but we \nwelcome guests from outside.'
270761:'It has been some time since \nwe last had human visitors.'
270762:'You people came from outside, \ndidn't you? I could tell right away. \nI know everybody in this town.'
270763:'Hey, hey, people from outside...\nDo something interesting!'
270764:'Well, if it isn't <STR>(JUD)! \nIt's been a while! \nHow are you?'
270765:'How many years has it been \nsince you've been back in \nMyorzo? Not that it matters.'
270766:'The monster in the sky isn't the \nsame one on the ancient relief \nwe have here in Myorzo, is it?'
270767:'Myorzo is protected by an \nEntelexeia. We'll be safe \nno matter what happens.'
270768:'I-I'm not scared \nof that thing! \nHmph!'
270769:'We're not gonna be eaten \nby that monster, right?'
270770:'I can't believe the image \nof the Adephagos on our \nrelief became reality...'
270771:'Should we Kritya \njust stay hiding \ninside Myorzo?'
270772:'Welcome to Myorzo. \nThings certainly seem \ntumultuous outside.'
270773:'Of course, it doesn't \nhave anything to do \nwith us living here.'
270774:'There's such a commotion \noutside. Do something \nabout it. Please.'
270775:'This is just my opinion, but the \ngiant building that erupted from \nthe ground is very suspicious.'
270776:'There's nothing in any of \nour lore that mentions \nsuch a massive construction.'
270777:'There must be something \nwe can do, too.'
270780:'Well, well... \nSo you're the humans? \nIt's nice to meet you.'
270781:'We may not look the same, but \nI suppose humans and Krityans \nreally aren't all that different.'
270782:'Did you know \nthere's another Kritya \ntown besides Myorzo?'
270786:'I think that beast \nmay be the Adephagos \ndepicted on the relief...'
270787:'I wonder how they \nmanaged to defeat the \nAdephagos in the past.'
270790:'Can blastia really \nbe used to brighten \nup the night?'
270791:'If we used blastia to \nbrighten up the night, when \nwould we be able to sleep?'
270794:'This town will always \nbe safe as long as \nwe have the Entelexeia.'
270795:'I don't like the \nsky like this. \nNot at all.'
270798:'Why don't you people \nuse your blastia to \nkill that monster?'
270802:'What are you doing \nloitering around at a time \nlike this, <STR>(JUD)? <PAGE>You really haven't changed. '
270803:'You don't remember me? \nI used to invite you out \nto play all the time.'
270804:'<STR>(JUD), you used \nto walk around \nat night. <PAGE>It was insomnia... \nIt must have been hard. '
270805:'I used to be jealous \nthat you couldn't \nsleep at night. <PAGE>I mean, you can play \naround at night too!'
270808,274781,274784:'Good evening. \nPlease take your time.'
270810,274783,274786:'I'm not certain you will \nfind anything of use, \nbut please stop by again. <PAGE>Thank you very much.'
270811:'This is our elder's house. \nIt's the largest house \nin the entire town.'
270812:'The elder's house \nholds a strange, \nold relief.'
270813,270815:'I'm sure the \nelder is inside.'
270814,270816:'Did you see the relief in the \nelder's house? Doesn't it look \nlike the monster in the sky?'
270823,270825,270827:'And what might bring \nyou here at this late hour?'
270824:'So you're finally ready to hear \nabout the legendary cucumber...\nOh, that's not it?'
270826:'Youngsters these days just have \nno appreciation for the magnificence \nof the legendary cucumber.'
270828:'I've said to myself that \nno night can last forever, \nbut perhaps I spoke too soon.'
270829:'I never imagined the day would \ncome when I would see the \nAdephagos with my own eyes...'
270831,270837:'Is that the beast shown \nour ancient relief?'
270832,270838:'How did people in \nancient times manage to \nsubdue the Adephagos?'
270833,270839:'You can see the beast in \nthe sky even from here. \nHow big could it be?'
270834,270840:'Hey, you. \nGet rid of that \nmonster already.'
270841,270844:'Welcome. This is all just \nstuff in transport, but \nis there anything you want?<PAGE>Thanks.'
270847:'Good evening. This is all just \nstuff in transport, but \nis there anything you want?'
270850:'Welcome back. I decided to \nset up shop here instead of sending \nthis stuff to the Nor Harbor.'
270862:'There's no turning back now...\nI'm prepared to have my \nbones buried in this Hold.'
270870,270872:'You need to be more \ncareful when traveling by \nnight than during the day.'
270873:'The southern sky is so \nstrange... Zaphias must \nbe right beneath it.'
270874:'Go south if you're \nheading for Zaphias.'
270875:'Lately, I've been getting \nthe creepiest feeling when \nit starts to get dark.'
270876:'Can it really be \ntrue that the Commandant \ncommitted treason?'
270877:'The nights are actually easier for \nme. That way, I don't have to look \nat that awful thing in the sky.'
270878:'I wonder if that \nmonster will still be up \nthere when morning comes.'
270897:'Lots of monsters can see \nin the dark. Watch out if \nyou're leaving the Hold.'
270898:'If you ever feel like \nyou're in danger, just \ncome back to the Hold.'
270899:'I'm afraid you'll \nhave to sit tight \nuntil morning.'
270900:'The Lord of the Plains actually \ncalms down a bit at night, but \nI'm still not opening this gate.'
270901:'I'll bet the blossoms \nat Halure are a sight \nto see at night.'
270903:'Even if the Lord of the Plains \ndoesn't show up, we still \nhave to be on our guard. <PAGE>Monsters can see \nwell at night. '
270908:'If things get really bad, we \ncan always retreat to Halure. \nThe barrier there will protect us.'
270909:'It's hard to see at night, \nbut that monster's somewhere \nup there right now, isn't it?'
270910:'I sure hope we're safe here.'
270915,270918,270921,270924,270927,270930,270933,270936:'Thank you. \nWe pray for your safety \nduring this trip. '
270953,270957:'Whoa, I must've dozed \noff there for a sec.'
270954,270958:'I love the night shift. \nIt's harder to get \ncaught slacking off.'
270955:'Still, I'd better not \nfool around with the Lord \nof the Plains nearby.'
270956:'I wonder how much longer \nit'll be until we can start \nleaving the gate open...'
270959:'*Yawn* I can't seem \nto help getting sleepy \nwhen it gets dark.'
270960:'I wonder if anyone's \ngoing to come relieve \nme anytime soon.'
270961:'Did something big happen in \nthe capital? I guess it doesn't \nreally concern me, but...'
270962:'Here's hoping this \nnight's a quiet one.'
270963:'I wonder if it's all \nright for me to just \nstay at my watch here...'
270964:'Either way, I sure could \ndo with some sleep.'
270965:'A monster in the sky...? \nI gotta be dreaming...'
270966,270968:'What, that's no dream? \nThen the monster's real?'
270967:'No, I'm dreaming, I tell you. \nIf I can just get back to sleep, \nit'll be gone when I wake up.'
270976:'I heard there's a \ndifferent road that'll \ntake you to Halure. <PAGE>Unfortunately, I don't \nknow where that road is.'
270985,270987,270989:'This is the soldiers' \nguardhouse. What could you \npossibly need at this hour?'
270986,270988,270990:'If you don't have a good \nreason for being here, I'll \nhave to ask you to leave.'
270991:'Another day, another \ncrisis averted.'
270992:'What could you possibly \nneed at this hour?'
271025:'I had no idea it \ncould get to be \nthis dark at night. '
271029:'I got a little hurt, but it's \nnothing. Just kiss it and it'll \nbe all better. Kissy kissy!'
271030:'This is...OW!\n...It's nothing! ♪'
271031:'Oooh, this hurts. \nSeriously, I'm in pain.<PAGE>But I'm a man. \nAnd real men \ndon't whine.'
271032:'How come these two \nare so easygoing... '
271033:'Some monster almost \nate me alive! I guess \nthat's life, though.<PAGE>Everybody dies sometime. \nThere's nothing scary \nabout it.'
271034:'Ohhh, the air here is wonderful. \nMy wounds hurt a little, \nbut it's so refreshing here!'
271038:'The answer is: \nget some sleep.<PAGE>It's already night, y'know. '
271044:'Just the two of us, all alone \nin the dark... Whaddya think? \nPretty romantic, huh? '

271056:'We'll need to be getting \nsome rest ourselves \nbefore too long. '

271060:'I can't imagine any reason \nto go back to Zaphias. '
271061:'This place is actually starting \nto look like a real town. \nBut compared to Zaphias... '
271062:'I want to get \nback to the city. '
271067:'I was headed for Torim, \nbut <STR>(FRE) ordered \nme assigned here!<PAGE>I hope to meet all of the \ncitizens and be remembered! '
271070:'So this is how \ntowns are built! '
271071:'I think I've had a really \nimportant experience here.'
271072:'It's too dangerous at night! \nAre you sure it's okay?'
271076:'I don't get it. Everyone's all \nhappy just because this place looks \na little like a real town now. '
271077:'Did they forget \nhow much better \nlife in Zaphias was? '
271078:'I suppose I'd be happy \nhere if they'd just build \na nice hot spring. '
271079:'Wh-what? A hot spring \nwouldn't hurt, right?! '
271082:'It feels good to \nwork, doesn't it? '
271083:'When I think about what \nI'm doing here, I feel \nlike I'm really living. '
271084:'We're a lot stronger \nthan we think, you know? '
271085:'I never thought we'd \nbe able to build \nan entire town. '
271093,271105,271123:'Just because it's \nnight, there's no excuse \nfor lax security. '
271096,271097,271106,271107,271124,271125:'I used to be really frightened \nwhen night came, but \nthat's behind me now.'
271098,271108:'This is the land of hope, \nAurnion. They say it \nmeans "Light of Thawing Snow".<PAGE>It's the perfect name \nfor a town built upon a \ngreat many hardships.'
271099,271113:'The town's become worthy \nof it's name. Now we have to \nprotect it with our lives.'
271111:'We're getting along with the \nnobles now... Maybe it's because \nwe all built this town together. '
271112:'Back in the lower \nquarter, they hated \nus just for being.'
271115:'Life in this town has become much \neasier. Now if only things beyond \nthe barrier would quiet down... '
271116:'Maybe I'm asking \nfor too much. '
271117:'If people put their \nminds to it, they really \ncan do anything. '
271118:'Living in this town \ntaught me that. '
271119:'I loved life in Zaphias, \nbut now I prefer it here. '
271120:'It's especially nice \nwhen <STR>(FRE) passes by. '
271122:'<STR>(FRE) made it, so if you \nask me, they should \nhave called it <STR>(FRE)town. '

271141:'Altosk's amazing... \nDid you see how they took \nout all those monsters?'
271163:'Dahngrest is a city of guilds.\nIt's probably the freest place on earth!♪'
271164:'All those stuffy old strait-laced Empire types \nshould go back and huddle together \non their own little continent.♪'
271167,271168:'Dahngrest is the best. \nWith all the guilds banded together, \nmonsters are no match for us!♪ '

271205:'Sir... You might want to stop \ngoggling at everything. It's obvious \nyou're not from around here.<PAGE>I don't know where you're \nfrom, but not everyone in \nDahngrest is nice.'

271231:'Apparently, something happened \nin Nordopolica, but I'm going \nto keep doing business here.'
271279:'We will keep the peace \nhere in Dahngrest.'
271280:'We will keep the peace at \nnight here in Dahngrest.'
271281:'I can't believe monsters \nwould show up in town... \nI bet the Empire's behind it.'

271314:'What, are we all supposed hold \nhands with the Knights and \nplay pattycake? What a joke!'
271315,271316:'This ain't just bad... It's \nreally bad! Nothing to do but \nmake a break for it again!'

271332:'There's nothing one man can \ndo about that tornado. It's \nunfortunate, but can't be helped.'
271343:'So... What monsters should \nI go hunting next? <PAGE>I'll think about it tonight.'
271362:'At this rate, we could even \ntake on the Empire...'
271371:'If Barbos was still alive, \nhe'd take that thing down \nbefore you could blink.'
271388:'And then make mincemeat \nout of the Empire!'
271392:'Ain't nobody getting \nfriendly with the Empire'
271394:'Not that it \nwould beat me in \na fight, mind you.'
271395:'Is it true\nBelius died?'
271396:'Not that I really care.'
271437,271438,271439,271440:'Wh-what shall we do?\nIf we stay in this town any longer,\nwe're going to be in danger.'
271447:'The people here \nare nervous. \nWhat is it now?'
271491,271492:'Huh? Hey! You all! \nDon't just sit there \ndoing nothing!'
271493:'The Knights aren't gonna \nbe any help! We'll protect \nDahngrest ourselves!'
271495:'You want to see the \nDon? He just took off, \nleading some forces.'
271496:'Where are they going? \nWho knows? No clue.'
271497:'Where are they keeping \nthat Knight they caught? \nI want to go laugh at him.'
271517,271518:'Monsters are evil, so we \nkill 'em! That's the mission \nof the Hunting Blades.'
271521:'Union headquarters are up ahead.\nDid you want to see the Don?<PAGE>I'm sure he's asleep \nat this hour.'
271522:'Of course, even the \nDon sleeps at night.<PAGE>You know the elderly \nget to bed early.'
271533:'I hear the chief went \na little wild in Nordopolica.'
271534:'I hope Nan and Tison\nare doing all right.'
271537,271538:'Whoa, whoa! What \nthe hell is this? \nWhat's going on?'
271539:'Empire types aren't good \nfor anything. That goes for \nthe Imperial Knights, too.'
271551,271552:'This is bad. It's \ndangerous to get on \nPalestralle's bad side.'
271557,271558,271559,271560:'I wonder what the \nDon would do...'
271567:'...For a monster, that \nthing's just a little \ntoo big to feel real.\nOh well. \nWe gotta take it down \nlike any other monster...!'
271569:'Did you get to meet the Don? \nNow that's what I call a great man!'
271570:'I mean, you know... \nHe's the Don!'
271585:'The fun never \nends in this town.'
271586:'Of course, that's exactly \nwhy I like Dahngrest.'
271598:'Peace is nice.'
271606:'The Don wasn't \na bad guy. Why'd \nhe have to die?'
271615:'I never thought the \nDon would pass on \nbefore this old man...'
271616:'To live such a \nfruitful life and \nhave it end that way...'
271628:'Zaphias Brew, Ehmead Snow,\nDese... They're good drinks\nthat will really quench your thirst.'
271630:'I'll bring out the really good \nstuff when that happens!'
271631:'Are things all right outside? \nI'll go out there if anyone \nneeds help.'
271633:'The customers just won't \nstop complaining lately.'
271634:'They complain so much I want \nto start complaining myself.'
271638:'What would you like? \nCider? Soda? Milkshake?<PAGE>Or maybe rain water is good \nenough for you? We also have hot \nmiso soup, if that's your fancy.'
271651:'What? A monster \nconvered in flames?\nYou delirious?'
271652:'Yeah, I'm troubled, \nbut I ain't about to say \nanything stupid like you.'
271653:'I'm just a mercenary. \nWhy'd I even help \nrepair that bridge?'
271654:'Well, I guess it would \nbe pretty inconvenient \nwithout a bridge.'
271655:'The Don was the Don, right to the end.'
271660:'Ooooh... *Burp!*'
271661:'Nothing is solved by \ndrinking. I know that.<PAGE>But I can't get by \nwithout this stuff.'
271691:'The folks at this tavern... \nIt's always the same old faces.'
271692:'I guess there's just \na lot of people with \ntime on their hands.'
271693:'Someone let slip that \nLeviathan's Claw\nis making a move.'
271694:'Nothing good ever comes \nwhen Leviathan's Claw makes a move.<PAGE>'Course, that's exactly \nwhat they're going for.'
271699:'A good drink is called for sometimes.\nBut don't go drinking too much.'
271711:'That bird monster's \ngonna be a problem.<PAGE>I don't care how much trust \nI regain, I don't want to \ngo up against that thing.'
271712:'Get another guild if \nyou want that thing dead.'
271723:'Don't talk to me \nor you'll get a whipping.'
271724:'Don't talk to me \nor I'll make you eat worms.'
271725:'Don't talk to me \nor I'll make soup out of you.'
271726:'Don't talk to me \nor you'll be seeing \nblack and blue.'

271735:'Don't talk to me \nor I'll make you pay \nfor my dinner.'
271736:'Don't talk to me \nor you'll be living in \nthe second dimension.'
271737:'Don't talk to me\nor you'll have a \ndelicate situation.'
271738:'Don't talk to me \nor you'll be covered \nin ash.'
271739:'Don't talk to me \nor I'll milk you.'
271740:'Don't talk to me \nor you'll be standing \nunder a waterfall.'
271741:'Don't talk to me \nor you'll be \neating bread.'
271742:'Don't talk to me \nor you won't \nbe laughing.'
271745:'First the Knights, now \nthe mercenaries?'
271783,271784,271787,271788,271789,271790,271791,271792,271793,271794,271795,271796,271799,271800,271803,271804,271805,271806,271807,271808:'This is the Union, where \nthe guilds come together.'
271785,271786:'Th-the barrier disappeared?! \nI-I have to inform the Don!'
271797,271798:'Wha... M-monsters showed up?! \nI-I have to inform the Don!'
271801,271802:'This is the Union, where \nthe guilds come together... \nBut the Don is gone...'
271813:'I-I  never actually fought monsters \nbefore... They're terrible! M-my \nhands are still shaking...'
271817:'So there are even feuds \nwithin the Union...'
271819,271821:'I'm looking for people \nto join my new guild.'
271820,271822:'Ever thought about making \na guild of your own?'
271823:'What? Monsters again?\nWhat a great opportunity!\nOur guild's first job!'
271827:'If only we were a \nlittle stronger...the Don\nwouldn't have had to die.'
271828:'What's going to happen to \nthe Union without the Don?'
271829:'I don't care what \nhappens to the Empire.'
271830:'The only thing that matters \nis what happens to us, right?'
271831,271832,271833,271834:'I'm going to defend this town!'
271837,271838:'I've never heard of such \na huge pack of monsters. \nWhat's going on?'
271839,271840:'We have to go check out \nthe forest ofKeiv Moc... \nIt's to the west, if I remember right.'
271841,271842:'Sooner or later, \nwe're going to have \nto fight the Empire.'
271843,271844:'Barbos always did have \nambition... It looks like \nhe finally made his move.'
271845,271847:'The city's calmed \ndown a little.'
271846,271848:'At least, compared to \nhow crazy it's been.'
271849,271850:'We can deal with any monster \nas long as we're follwing the \nDon's orders!'
271852:'Palestralle's a tough enemy.'
271853:'Nobody wanted things \nto end up like this.'
271855,271856:'Right now we have to \nconcentrate all our efforts \non preserving the Union.'
271861,271862:'DonDonDonDonnnnnn'
271885:'Welcome. Will you \nbe staying? \nThat will be 100 Gald.'
271886:'呼宿出休みますか？'

272018:'If I were to guess, \nI'd say it was about \n1,000 years old...<PAGE>You'd know it \nif you saw it.'
272048:'A cold drink in the \nafternoon is the best!'
272101:'What?!\nThe barrier was fixed?'
272123,272125:'The barrier disappeared.\nHow should I respond\nto this situation?'
272124,272126:'There's no way \nthe monsters could \nbring it down...'
272127:'They say someone tampered\nwith the barrier blastia.'
272128:'We'll have to put the \nbarrier blastia under much heavier \nguard from now on.'
272129:'Even our mighty barrier won't \nprotect us against the Knights.'
272130:'If only we had a barrier\nthat worked against people.'
272131:'I bet the barrier failure \nwas Barbos's doing, too.'
272133,272135:'The barrier is stable for another day.\nAs long as we have the barrier,\nthe town is at peace.'
272134,272136:'The barrier is a symbol\nof this town's peace.'
272137:'The monsters\npenetrated the barrier so easily.\nAre we even safe?'
272139:'The barrier failure, the monsters \nattacking... So much for the \nfairytale about barrier safety.<PAGE>Sure, we're safer with it,  \nbut it's no guarantee.'
272141:'Barriers protect us from monsters, \nbut they can't protect us from \nthe evil of other humans.<PAGE>The Don\nprotected us\nfrom that.'
272143:'The barrier in Zaphias\nis acting up.<PAGE>If you put all your trust in the barrier,\nit could hurt you in the end.'
272147:'The time may have come\nwhere we need to find a way\nto live without the barrier.'
272165:'The Knights helped \nus repair our bridge.'
272166:'I guess there are some \ndecent Knights, after all.'
272218:'Yet again, I failed \nto seize the opportunity \nto show my true strength.'

272718:'Zzz... Whoa, looks \nlike I nodded off.'
272719:'Zzz... \n...Who me? \nI'm not sleepin'.'
272720:'Zzz... Th-the \nstone...!<PAGE>Huh, guess it was a dream.'
272721:'Zzz... Grandma, \nmy stone...<PAGE>*Mumble, mumble...* Hah!'
272722:'Zzz... Which one's more \nimportant? You or my stone? \nWell now, grandma...<PAGE>...Hah!'
272723:'Zzz... Well, ya see \nnow mother, that \nstone is, it's...<PAGE>Hah!'
272724:'Zzz... Whoa, I conked \nout, there...<PAGE>That stone's become the only \nthing I dream about lately.'
272725:'Zzz... Come on now, stone, \nI'm so sleepy...<PAGE>...Huh...? Guess \nI nodded off.'
272726:'Zzz... \n...Huh...?<PAGE>You'd better have some news about my \nstone if you've gone and woke me up, \nor I'm gonna be real angry, ya hear?'
272727:'Zzz... \n...Huh...? \nWhat?<PAGE>Again, huh?'
272728:'Zzz... \nHuh...?<PAGE>About the only thing I'm gonna listen to at this \nlate hour, is some tasty tidbits about my stone.'
272729:'Zzz... \nHuh...?<PAGE>If you're wakin' me up this late at night, does that \nmean you've got some news about my precious stone?'
272730:'The magistrate's takes his own \ncut of the taxes, so I'm not \nselling anything right now.<PAGE>Sorry to get your hopes up.'
272731:'I lucked out on this sweet spot, though, \nso I've gotta hold onto it...'
272732:'Now that Ragou's gone, a new \nmagistrate's on their way.<PAGE>Here's hoping that means the \ntaxes'll be lowered a bit...'
272733:'Just you wait a few months, \nand my shop'll have the hottest \ngoods in town...I hope.'
272734:'The new magistrate's arrived, but \nthe taxes haven't come down yet...<PAGE>I guess it's no easy thing for a low-level \nbureaucrat to cut taxes once they've \nbeen inflated, though.'
272735:'Man, just when am I gonna be able to get \nthis business back on its feet again...?'
272736:'There's some real panic breaking out around \nthe capital... And now the Tolbyccian continent's \ngone nuts over the death of the Don.<PAGE>There's no telling when I'll be able \nto get business going again...'
272737:'Just how am I supposed to \nscrape out a living, come \ntomorrow, I ask ya...?'
272738:'My savings is draining away one day at \na time, just paying for this spot...<PAGE>So what am I still doing here? This is \nthe best spot in the lot, and I'll be \ndamned if I'm just gonna let it go.'
272739:'I know that's sorta like putting \nthe cart before the horse, but \nI can't let myself quit.'
272740:'If you ask me, there's been more misfortune \nlately than when Ragou was running things.<PAGE>Maybe I'm in the wrong for being \nso attached to this place.'
272741:'Wonder if my luck'll change \nif I move to another town \nand open a shop there.'
272742:'I've made up my mind! If this store's \ngoing down, I'm going down with it!<PAGE>Let 'em call me crazy if they want to. \nI'm gonna do my business right here.'
272743:'If I survive, and I manage to start \ngetting items in on a regular basis, \ncome back and see me some time.<PAGE>I'll be waiting for ya.'
272744:'Oooh. If the port's shut down, we're \ngoing to run out of stock!<PAGE>There's no way we can compete with Fortune's \nMarket if we're forced to sell only \nwhat we can find on Ilyccia.'
272745:'The place across the street \nseems to be doing all right... \nOoh! That just burns me! '
272746:'The harbor's been opened again, but no boats \nhave arrived yet. When will they get here?<PAGE>Come on, get here already!'
272747:'It's like I can feel our business \nlosing customers by the minute... \nI mean, give us a break already!'
272748:'The trade routes still aren't \nback to normal, yet.<PAGE>Oooh! I swear, Fortune's Market is \ntrying to establish a monopoly!'
272749:'I wonder if Fortune's Market wouldn't \nlet us join up with them...'
272750:'Fortune's Market has \ntheir own exclusive \nsupply routes!<PAGE>Like through the glacial plains in the \nnorth part of the continent, for example. \nHow can we compete with that?'
272751:'Transporting cargo across \nthin sheets of ice is one \nrisky proposition, right?'
272752:'The port is clogged with battleships, and some \nweird building's popped up out in the ocean.<PAGE>So how is Fortune's Market \ngetting all their \nmerchandise, huh?'
272753:'Business is booming for the place across \nthe way, even at times like this...<PAGE>Hmm, joining Fortune's Market doesn't \nseem so bad now, after all...'
272754:'With the world as unstable as \nit is, I decided to cut my losses \nand join  Fortune's Market.<PAGE>And now I get hit with all sorts of \nentry fees and member's dues! Do \nthey think money grows on trees?!'
272755:'Wherever you go, it's the \nlocals in a given area that \nhave to stick together...'
272756:'We've had earthquakes, and the mountain to the north collapsed. \nHonestly, there's times I've almost packed up and left.<PAGE>But leaving the place I was raised \nin...much less venturing outside \nthe barrier, is just...you know?'
272757:'The people in the shop next \ndoor haven't given up, so I've \ngot to stay strong myself.'
272758:'Zzz... \n...Huh?<PAGE>I've gone and fallen asleep right \nwhen the world's in a pinch...'
272759:'Zzz... \n...Huh?<PAGE>Dag nabbit, I fell \nasleep again.'
272760:'Well, now. Travelers, are you? This is something you \ndon't see everyday. No one but me here at Nor inn, \nI'm afraid. Do come and stay a bit, if you like.'
272761:'It's gotten quite late, hasn't \nit? Why not turn in for \nthe night at our inn?'
272762:'It's late, travelers. \nDo what's best and stay \nthe night at the inn.'
272763:'If you wander about too late, you're \nlikely to run into the mer-people \nwho come ashore at night.'
272764:'Early checkout will save you 3 Gald, but \nlate checkin costs 3 Gald extra. Why not \ncall it a day and stay at the inn?'
272765,272767,272769,272771,272773:'It's gotten quite late, you \nknow. You must be sleepy.'
272766:'Haste makes waste, as they say. Why not \ntake a breather and slow things down. \nHere now, right this way to the inn.'
272768:'It's bad luck to wander about \ntoo much after dark. You'd be \nwise to stay a night with us.'
272770:'You may be in town, but the dark can \nbe quite dangerous. Best to stay \na night with us, if you ask me.'
272772:'Where could you be off \nto at this late hour? \nWhy not stay with us?'
272774:'Ragou, you no good cheat. \nHick... Let us take the \nboats out, dammit...<PAGE>It's gettin' ta be, I can't get \nby without drinkin' these days...'
272775:'I want ta be on a ship again! \nTa be out on the sea...'
272776:'A man's at home on the \nsea. *Hic*... I can hear \nit callin' me... <PAGE>A toast, to \nthe sea!'
272777:'O, a man needs the \nsea! Needs ta travel \nthe ocean's roads!'
272778:'What's the deal with this town, anyway? \nHick... A fella's liable ta go stir \ncrazy, in a place like this...<PAGE>But I can send my sorrows packin', so \nlong as I've got my drink ta help me.'
272779:'O, the sea... O, the \nsun... Ahh, there's \nnothin' finer...'
272780:'Was that south, ya said...? \nHick... If you're talkin' bearings, \nthen speak up man...!<PAGE>Ooh... What the... \nWhat the hell's gonna \nhappen ta me...?'
272781:'Sing...! O, \ninverted \nworld...!'
272782:'I saw a ring, I did! \nHick... What the hell's \nthat mean, huh...?!<PAGE>Urgh...<PAGE>I'm in the mood for a drink!'
272783:'A ring...! It's \nround. Perfectly...round...?'
272784:'Somethin' not right with \nthat sky. Hick... Aw, \nwho gives a damn...?<PAGE>It all disappears when \nI drink, right...?!'
272785:'This ugly sky! My hands and my feet! \nI want to forget it all...!'
272786:'That earthquake freaked \nme out, man... Hick... \nI don't feel so good...<PAGE>The sky's spinnin. \nI can't feel \nmy legs...!'
272787:'I'm a man...! Go ahead an' \ncrumble, ya mountain...! \nDamn, that's scary...!'
272788:'"Rhybgaro! A beast that shines like the \ngolden light of the sun! Will he appear \nin the vicinity of Torim Harbor?"<PAGE>That's what the paper said. It likes \nthe water, so apparently it only \nshows itself on rainy days.'
272789:'Ahh, what a lovely color, gold... The \nworld is coming up roses, my dears.'
272790:'Heard the headlines? "New magistrate to be appointed \nin Torim Harbor! And only 18 years old!"<PAGE>As of tomorrow, \nthis town is going \nto be reborn.'
272791:'Ahh, I love the smell of renewal in the morning... \nThe world's coming up roses, my dears.'
272792:'Did you hear? "The Duce of the coliseum's \nhidden past revealed! Mastermind of \nthe Great War falls at last!" Finally, \nI can sleep soundly at night.'
272793:'Ahh, my but peace is lovely... The \nworld is coming up roses, my dears.'
272794:'Have you heard? "The citizens of the capital \ntake leave for a new promised land! Will \nthey find the hope of a new life?"<PAGE>The capital may have been ruined, \nbut maybe this'll give those \nfolks a new start.'
272795:'Ahh, the frontier spirit is a beautiful thing... \nThe world's coming up roses, my dears.'
272796:'This one says "Capital Liberated! \nDisorder Continues"! <PAGE>I'm just glad they've \navoided the fate our \ntown had to suffer. '
272797:'Ahh, isn't liberation simply marvelous...? \nThe world's coming up roses, my dears.'
272798:'"Mysterious ruins surface on the seas! Knights \narrive on scene, relieve world's fears!" \nor so I hear. Well thank goodness.<PAGE>No telling what might \nhappen if that thing \nwere left unattended.'
272799:'Ahh, my but those Knights are certainly dashing... \nThe world's coming up roses, my dears.'
272800:'Yo travelers, what's up? Welcome \nto the port town of Capua Nor.'
272801:'Capua is split between Capua \nNor to the south and Capua \nTorim to the North.<PAGE>You're in Nor now, on the south side.'
272806:'I've heard the barrier in the \ncapital's been torn down.<PAGE>Hope our blastia here's \ngonna be okay.'
272807:'The blastia of this town is fashioned \nin the shape of an anchor.<PAGE>Look here, see how it's \nwritten on the ground?'
272808:'I heard they managed to get the blastia \nin the capital back under control more \nor less, but you never can be too sure.<PAGE>We've got to...well, get this \ntown ready for...for whatever \ntomorrow might bring...'
272809:'I hear we get researchers from Aspio \nthat come now and again to keep \nour blastia in good repair.<PAGE>'Course the patient's always \ngonna protest that they're \nin good health.'
272810:'We've been having a series of earthquakes in these parts, \nrecently. Makes you wonder, you know. I've always thought \nthe bedrock around here was supposed to be solid.'
272811:'I swear there's more than meets the eye with \nthese earthquakes. It just might have something \nto do with that monster up in the sky...'
272812:'Aspio was located right smack at the \nbase of that tower. It had to've been \njust flattened, no two ways about it.<PAGE>Now who's gonna come to \ndo maintenance on the \nblastia, I ask ya...?'
272813:'Gotta admit though, that thing is the definition \nof big. Wouldn't be surprised if the entire \nIlyccian continent just up and sank...'
272814:'I can't stop thinking \nabout that sound. What \ncould it have been? <PAGE>They really should post news \nup on the boards faster.'
272815:'I just can't wait \nfor them to post the \nlatest news here.<PAGE>I'm so excited!'
272816:'It says, "Commandant Flynn of \nthe Imperial Knights Building City \non Hypionia. Open Call for Names."<PAGE>I just might go...'
272817:'Ahh, there's nothing like breaking new ground, I tell you... The world's coming up roses my dears.'
272818:'Lakiko... My dearest friend...<PAGE>Ragou took her away, and I \nhaven't seen her since...'
272819:'I don't want to have to go. \nDoes that make me selfish...?'
272820:'I've been so worried about that girl, \nI haven't been getting any sleep.<PAGE>My dear friend has come back \nfrom Ragou's mansion... Oh, I \nhope everything's all right.'
272821:'Her mother says that she still \nwakes herself up each night with \nthe sounds of her own screams.'
272822:'I haven't been able to sleep \nsince my friend told me \nabout Ragou's misdeeds.<PAGE>I'm so glad I didn't press her to tell me everything.'
272823:'I have these bad dreams every night. \nThese bodiless people won't \nstop staring at me... Ooh...'
272824:'When I go to bed at night I have \nnightmares so I can't sleep...<PAGE>And I have to stay awake during \nthe day, so I can't sleep then...'
272825:'Wow... I am working on a serious \nsleep deficit here...'
272826:'Ragou kept me from sleeping, but \nlately, I've finally started getting \nto sleep more regularly.<PAGE>For a while there, I wanted \nto sleep so badly I thought \nI might go crazy.'
272827:'But now I can't keep from thinking \nawful thoughts during my waking hours. \nI guess I'm just no good...'
272830:'Did you see the new magistrate? \nHe's a friendly looking young \nguy with blond hair.<PAGE>The last magistrate looked \nlike he'd be a friendly \nold man at first, too.'
272831:'Power eventually corrupts the personalities \nof people who hold it.<PAGE>...That's what that knight \nwith the mask and the spiky \ngreen hair said, anyway.'
272832:'The taxes aren't going down! I even \nsaw the guy at that stall over there \nstart crying. It's just rotten.<PAGE>What with the taxes \nso high, nobody \ncan buy anything.'
272833:'Higher taxes should mean greater \nreturns to the people, and further \nbenefit to their lives.<PAGE>...Or at least that's what the \nroly-poly egghead with the blue \nhair and the scary voice said.'
272834:'I heard the ocean to the north got all frozen \nsolid because of that "aer" stuff.<PAGE>Hey, if the sea water freezes, \ndo you think the ice \nwould taste salty?'
272835:'The "aer" makes it possible for us \nto live our daily lives. We must \ngive thanks for its existence.<PAGE>...That's what that pink-haired \nKrityan lady with \na broom said.'
272836:'It's awesome! A bunch of the \nempire's battleships are docked \nin the harbor right now.<PAGE>What's so cool about that? Well, \nthey're made all out of metal!'
272837:'The warship called Sieg Krunos \ndoes 30 knots on the open sea, \nwith its "eh-ar terbines." <PAGE>...That's what the tan, \nshort-haired, tomboy-looking \nsailor girl was saying, anyway.'
272839:'Besides, even if the world is ending, \nas long as we don't give up \nhope, we can go on fighting.<PAGE>...I heard that from \nthis hero with spiky \nblond hair.'
272840:'Have you gone up the tower that came \nout of that mountain in the north?<PAGE>It looks like it's made \nup of a bunch of different \nbuildings.'
272841:'The giant cities of the past were made \nup of buildings all stacked together that \nyou'd think they were really towers.<PAGE>...That's what this sword fighter \nwearing this big white bone \nthing on his head said.'
272842:'If only Ragou hadn't come, \nmy future would be looking \na lot more rosy...<PAGE>Everything I touch lately seems \nto turn to dirt. What can someone \nlike me do to get along...?'
272843:'I guess I'm just no good. And \nthe night only seems to make \nmy mood even worse...'
272844:'That was a really loud rumble. \nBut it didn't phase me. <PAGE>Nothing gets done \nby worrying.'
272845:'I should thank Ragou for \ngiving me the courage \nto face anything. <PAGE>Luckily, he isn't around \nto accept my gratitude.'
272846:'There was a time when all I did was worry. But I realized, what's the point?<PAGE>I've got to keep my chin up. Life's too short, right?'
272847:'When unimaginable events occur, all the little things in life seem to mean less to people.'
272848:'I hear there's a guy who badmouths \nthe magistrate, but he'll only \ndo it under the cover of night.<PAGE>If he's gonna gripe, he \nshould do it out in the \nopen, you know, like me.'
272849:'We can complain all we like, though. It's \nnot like anybody in charge is gonna listen.<PAGE>Not so long as they get to \nuse us for their amusement.'
272850:'That damned Council, with its damned high \ntaxes... It's enough to make a fella wanna \ngive up on earning an honest living.'
272851:'I mean, even when I get paid, my \nwallet's empty by the next day. \nMaybe I should just quit my job.'
272852:'If the Don were to die, it'd upset the \nbalance between the empire and the guilds, \nand most likely turn to all out war.<PAGE>Hip hip hooray, \nwe'll all go down \ntogether.'
272853:'...If that happens though, one guild or another's gonna \nmake a bid for power, which'll mean using that power \nto put down anybody who gets in their way. Gah...<PAGE>Fools, the lot \nof them!'
272854:'We've got the guilds, the Council, \nand now it's the Knights.<PAGE>They're only interested in \nusing what power they've got \nto run things their way.'
272855:'Just you watch. Sooner or later \nthis <STR>(FRE) character's gonna \nshow his true colors.'
272856:'That boat carrying all those \nrefugees has gotta be \nin rough shape. It's cramped, \nit stinks. Man, gives \nme goose bumps just \nthinking about it.'
272857:'Whatever, not like it's any skin \noff my back what happens to \nthat bunch from the capital.'
272858:'First the Don dies, then that Commandant of the Knights \nchecks out. You'd think we're due for some peace \nand quiet, and then we get this thing with Aspio.<PAGE>What the hell are all those mages \ncooking up over there, anyway?'
272859:'They're weak, but they \nhave some weird powers. <PAGE>But they don't have a clue \nhow to use their power. \nWe should be okay...'
272860:'Isn't that tower around Aspio? <PAGE>I think the mages are \ndefinitely planning something.'
272861:'I mean, a mage brought that \ntower back to begin with. <PAGE>He's going to monopolize \nthe blastia and get the \nEmpire on his side.'
272862:'Besides, it's not like the empire or the \nguilds can really do anything about it.'
272863:'You can never count on these guys \nwhen you really need them.'
272864:'If you're looking for something to snack \non after dark, gels are the way to go.<PAGE>Low in fat, and easy \non the digestion, there's \nno beating gels.'
272865:'Now if there was something like a night gel, \nyou know, that put you right to sleep, my midnight \nsnacking regimen would be complete.'
272866:'At night I hide a few gels \nunder my pillow, and snack \non them in secret.<PAGE>Don't tell my husband, okay?'
272867:'I'm so crazy about gels, I don't \nknow what to do with myself.'
272868:'If there's a problem with distribution, \nsupply and demand will break down, and \nwe'll be looking at a gel shortage.'
272869:'If I couldn't have gels in \nmy life, I think my heart \nmight just shrivel up...!'
272870:'This town's become quite a tough place \nfor people to live. It used to be \nsuch a sleepy little place...'
272871:'Now, Nor and Torim are different \nas night and day...<PAGE>Don't the guilds or the \nempire care at all how folks \nlike us are livin'?'
272872:'We never had a magistrate \nhere when I was younger. <PAGE>When did the Empire \nget so strict...?'
272873:'No matter how many new magistrates they \nsend us, they'll have a helluva time tryin' \nto beat the freedom of the old days.'
272874:'I hear that Don \nWhitehorse has \npassed on.<PAGE>I used to take care of that \nguy, back when we were just \nrunts. Honest to goodness.'
272875:'There was a time when the Don \nwas livin' with some relatives \nof mine in town here.<PAGE>He was five and I was eight. \nHeh, he used to look up \nto me in those days...'
272876:'You know, life might just be easier in \na different town. I've caught myself \nthinkin' that any number of times...<PAGE>I'm past the age \nfor pickin' up and \nmovin', though.'
272877:'All my old friends from this town \nhave passed on now. I've got nothin' \ntyin' me to this place anymore.<PAGE>Come to think of it...I've got nothin' \ntyin' me to this world anymore, either.'
272878:'I've heard there was a place called \nDuo between Torim and Nor that sank \nsometime before I was born.<PAGE>To think that I'd see the day when \nit'd rise back up... I've really \nbeen around quite a while.'
272879:'Huh? That thing floatin' on the \nthe waves isn't Duo, you say?<PAGE>Well then, what is it?'
272880:'The sky's gone and cracked... The \nstrangest things have been happenin' \none right on top of the next.<PAGE>A life long lived never ceases to amaze.'
272881:'Whoo boy, a life long lived never ceases to amaze.'
272882:'What a shock! What right's a tower \nthat size got to come juttin' \nout of a mountain like that?!<PAGE>Life never ceases to amaze.'
272883:'Wonder just what we've got \nin store for us next.<PAGE>Heh, I can hardly wait!♪'
272884:'So it seems that towns with a strong imperial \npresence enjoy greater peace and stability.'
272885:'We can walk free of worry in the \nstreets. What could be more splendid \nthan that? Wouldn't you agree?'
272886:'The actions of this magistrate, \nRagou, are inexcusable. He has \nsullied the empire's good name.'
272887:'Such a man is the exception to the \nrule, though. Surely the next magistrate \nwill set the record straight.'
272888:'If the Don dies, I can't see \nhow the guild Union can escape \nsuffering as a result.<PAGE>At any rate, it should help shore up the welfare \nof the empire, and of this town as well.'
272889:'Now is the time when the empire should \nuse its authority to reclaim direct \ncontrol over Capua Torim.<PAGE>It would seem that neither the Council nor \nthe Knights are eager to take action.'
272890:'Alexei may have once been the proud leader \nof the Imperial Knights, but he was proven to \nbe nothing but a lowly coward in the end.<PAGE>He was never cut out to \nbe a leader among men.'
272891:'If only we could have someone such \nas Sir Cumore, with an unimpeachably \nnoble pedigree, here.'
272892:'This young knight, Sir <STR>(FRE), is \ntruly quite capable, is he not?<PAGE>I can speak no ill of him, though \nhe cannot claim a noble upbringing.'
272893:'Still, he can be no match for \nthe likes of Sir Cumore.<PAGE>There is a knight who \nsurely has no equal.'
272894:'How long must we wait until the \nnext emperor ascends the throne?<PAGE>If only the matter of ascension could \nbe settled, then surely this disorder \nwould be eased somewhat.'
272895:'Be it His Highness Ioder, or some \nother candidate, the important \nthing is naming a successor...'
272896:'The situation outside the town appears quite dire. \nThings remain quite peaceful within, however.<PAGE>The low-born commoners do raise \na panic from time to time...'
272897:'We have a barrier here. \nWe shall be safe, \ncome what may.'
272898:'I've got to get \nto the capital.<PAGE>I have to protect \nthe gel factory...'
272899:'I wonder if going to the capital would \nmean leaving my husband behind...'
272900:'There's no telling when the \nsupply of gels might run out, \nso I'm keeping a lookout.<PAGE>...It looks like things \nare still okay.'
272901:'If it looks like they're selling out, maybe \nI should just buy up the whole stock. \nBut where will I get the money...?'
272902:'If the world is falling apart, it's no \ntime to worry about gels, is it...?'
272903:'If that thing in the sky were to \nbreak apart, it might just turn \ninto giant chunks of gel...'
272905:'This may not be the time to be calmly eating gel. '
272906:'Gels? Oh, I'm all through \nwith that. Bottles are where \nit's at these days.'
272907:'Holy bottles and dark bottles. \nWho needs gels as long \nas I've got those two.'
272908:'Basically speaking, \nlaunching boats \nat night is \nforbidden.<PAGE>Even if that weren't the case, the port has been \nclosed down on account of the recent storms.'
272909:'Whether the sun's rising or setting,\nit's rain, rain, and more rain.<PAGE>It really gets you down after a while.'
272910:'I hear those mermen don't sleep at night. They'll \nattack a ship after dark as soon as during the day.<PAGE>They've gotta sleep \nsometime, right...?'
272911:'Do you think maybe they \nwork in shifts...?'
272912:'My word, this view is \nsimply breathtaking.<PAGE>Gazing out at this scenery, the \ntrials and tribulations of daily \nlife seem to melt away.'
272913:'What can be waiting across\nthis ocean, I wonder.'
272914:'A new magistrate, you \nsay? And what of it?<PAGE>I should think such matters \nare of no concern to me.'
272915:'Whiling away my days gazing out at the \nsea is complete and utter bliss.'
272916:'It's so hot out today. Twice, no \nit's three times as hot as usual.<PAGE>Ooh... How I'd love \nto swim in the sea...'
272917:'Let's see, did I bring my bathing suit...? \nNot sure I feel like showing off my \narms though... You know how it is.'
272918:'That cloud there, it looks just like the whipped \ncream on a strawberry short cake...<PAGE>N-no! What am I saying...?!'
272919:'I'll surely lose some weight if only I can keep \nmy determination. I have the most marvelous getaway \nplanned for the beach here this summer...'
272920:'Things got a bit boisterous when \nsome other people arrived, \nbut the calm has returned.<PAGE>This beach is mine alone, and I won't \nstand sharing it with others.'
272921:'...If there's anything I simply \ncannot stand, it's noise...'
272922:'I've claimed this \nspot as my own private \nluxury box...<PAGE>What cares do I have about the world and it's \ntroubles, so long as I have this view?'
272923:'The sky? My eyes refuse \nto see anything that \nmight upset me.'
272924:'How long will I be able to \nremain here gazing out at \nthis impeccable scene?<PAGE>Oh, would that \nthis moment could \nlast a thousand \neons.'
272925:'Ahh, this rich tableau... Simply \nmarvelous... It's as though \nI were within a dream...'
272926:'Looks like the empire's got \nplans to lock down Nordopolica \nusing its battleships.<PAGE>It's just awful, the way they throw their \nweight around like that, if you ask me.'
272927:'There's no way the guilds stand \na chance if the empire really gets \nserious about wiping them out.'
272928:'The Knights have been launching \nboats, even after it gets dark.<PAGE>Those guys are asking for trouble if \nthey try to get a boat out on the \nwater in the middle of the night.'
272929:'The Knights are amateurs when it comes to the \nocean. They'd do well to hire some sailors who \nspecialize in this stuff. You know, like me.'
272930:'You'll never see more stars than when \nyou're out on the ocean. There's hundreds \nof times more than in any city.<PAGE>Navigating the sea at night's not \nfor amateurs though, mind you.'
272931:'You've never lived 'til you've seen \nthe night sky from out on the ocean.'
272932:'Does that glittering land shine \neven in the dark of night?<PAGE>I'd love to go see for myself.'
272933:'Is that island a product of all the disturbances \nthe world's been experiencing lately?'
272934:'If the continents themselves \nwere to sink, what would \nall the people do?<PAGE>It's not like we could just pile everybody \ninto a bunch of boats...'
272935:'Hey, we could build cities \non the ocean floor, and have \neverybody move down there.<PAGE>...Or maybe not.'
272936:'......<PAGE>Unless you've got business with the magistrate, \nyou'd best show yourselves out.'
272937:'Don't want to get yerselves hurt now, \ndo you? Then you'd be wise to beat it.'
272938:'......<PAGE>The magistrate's sleeping. \nCome back tomorrow.'
272939:'I don't think you want \nto see me angry.'
272940:'......The magistrate's \nsleeping. Come \nback tomorrow.'
272941:'Knock off that racket. Who \nthe hell are you, anyway?'
272942:'......<PAGE>The magistrate? He went \nback to the capital. \nThe exit's that way.'
272943:'I've got no time to \nplay games with you.'
272944:'......<PAGE>The magistrate isn't \nin. Beat it.'
272945:'I told you to beat \nit, so scram!'
272946:'......<PAGE>No meeting with the magistrate \nafter dark. Beat it.'
272947:'I'm tired, and that's got \nme in a bad mood. Next time \nI see you, you're dead!'
272949:'Yo punk... Just keep pressing \nyour luck... Find \nout what happens...'
272950:'This is magistrate Ragou's mansion. \nThere's no entry at this hour, \neven if you've got permission.'
272951:'I can't let you in, even if \nyou've been given permission.<PAGE>We've got strict instructions \nto admit no one while the \nmagistrate's sleeping.'
272952:'Once we've been hired, we've got no choice \nto do what we've been paid for, no matter \nwhat sort of guy the magistrate might be.'
272953:'If you've got business with the magistrate, \nwhy not use your head a little \nand come at a more normal hour?'
272954,272957,272960,272966,272969,272972:'Welcome, welcome. One night \nwill set you back 300 Gald.'
272956:'Thank you. Come stay \nwith us again.'
272963:'Ready to depart?\nTake care!'
272964,272965:'I hope there was something\nthat caught your interest.'
272975:'Hah hah hah. Come on, take it easy. \nLife's too short to do anything \nbut slow down and enjoy the ride.'
272976:'I'm frightened sometimes when I think about how \nrich I am. Oh my, I forgot that you all might \nbe poor. How terribly rude of me. Hah hah.'
272977:'Hoh hoh, how long until \nwe set sail, I wonder.<PAGE>Surely 10 million Gald would convince \nthem to get started early.'
272978:'I'm afraid 10 million \nGald is mere pocket change \nto me, hoh hoh.'
272979:'Heh heh. If they refuse to \nlaunch the ship, I'll just \nhave to buy the helmsman.<PAGE>Or perhaps you don't think 100 million \nGald will be sufficient.'
272980:'I'll feel the pinch of 100 million \nGald, to be sure, but what choice \ndo I have, really? Heh heh.'
272981:'No matter how much money one has, if the boat \nwon't sail, there's no point worrying over \nit. Perhaps this is as it should be.<PAGE>Without such inconveniences, \nhow else could I experience \nthe lives of the \ncommon people?'
272982:'Travel is a thing to be savored. \nIf you adopt this mindset, everything \ntakes on a special appeal.<PAGE>Though I will surely not stay here again, \neven this clap-board shack of an inn \nhas worked its quaint charms on me.<PAGE>I'm sure you agree. Perhaps \nthat's just what brought us \nto it in the first place.'
272983:'We mustn't forget that Ragou's position \nas magistrate was not without its perils.<PAGE>I refer, of course, to the monsters he \ngathered to pursue his refined hobbies.<PAGE>His tastes may run to the eccentric, and \nhis vision, a bit grandiose, but he simply \nexercised the privilege of his station.'
272984:'And now he's been branded a villain \nfor "abusing his authority" \nor some such nonsense.<PAGE>Honestly, the magistrate of this \ntown deserves our sympathies.<PAGE>Don't you think so, too? You \ndo, right? Don't you? Oh, \nsilly me, of course you do.'
272985:'The chief of the guilds has died, they say. Everyone \nseems to be in quite a panic over it.<PAGE>But I ask you; can there be any \nsadness that exceeds this country's \ncurrent lack of an emperor?<PAGE>Praising the achievements of the deceased \nis one thing, but mourning their \nloss won't bring them back.'
272986:'Those of us that remain must \ncarry on. It's really the only \nhope that we're left with.<PAGE>These people are so caught \nup in their weeping, they've \nforgotten this fact.<PAGE>We don't really need an emperor, when it comes \ndown to it. The empire will be just fine led \nby the Knights and the nobility alone.'
272987:'The capital's a mess. Nobody'll \neven go near it, now. Man, \nwhat am I gonna do? <PAGE>When times are uncertain, \nyou've got to move on to \nthe next chapter.'
272988:'What will become of my true-crime novel, \nthough...? Even I couldn't wait to \nsee what was gonna happen next.'
272989:'At that very moment, word came \nthat the ship his friend had \nbeen aboard, had sunk!<PAGE>His dear companion's life stolen by none other than \nthe black shadow draped across the ocean's expanse! \nWhatever shall he do, meek and powerless as he is?!'
272990:'As night bears down upon him, how shall \nhe find the light of a new day?!'
272991:'Alone, save for the trusty blade \nat my side, I leap onto the \nfoul sky monster's back.<PAGE>A slash and a hack and \na blur of steel!<PAGE>In no time at all, the monster's \nhide has been rent, and I stand \nover the beast, victorious!'
272992:'That's a sneak peek of the climactic finish. \nTune in next time for the final chapter!'
272994:'.... Don't interfere \nwith my work. <PAGE>Don't speak \nto me!'
272995:'The ominous shadow has now taken its \nleave, but we must remain vigilant.<PAGE>Though it may someday come again, to \nthreaten our world, never again shall \nhe fear its darkness. The end.'
272996:'Hmm, this started out as a nonfiction \nwork, but somewhere along the way \nit turned into a fantasy novel...'
272997:'I have yet to shake the fear that grips \nmy heart, and it keeps me from sleeping.<PAGE>What happened in Zaphias \nwas just terrible.'
272998:'I'll be all right, but \nI am deeply worried about \nmy child's future.'
272999:'Everything was wonderful when we \nlived in the capital. I could help \nmake my son's dreams a reality.<PAGE>But how can he think \nof writing a novel at \na time such as this?'
273000:'It goes to show how fragile we humans really are. \nIn the blink of an eye, our destiny, even the \nway we see the world can change for good.'
273001:'The passion to work on a novel, \nwriting feverishly through the \nnight without sleeping...<PAGE>If only he could put such \nenergy to better use...'
273002:'Ahh, I wish he'd turned out \na bit more like that young \ncaptain, Sir <STR>(FRE).'
273003,273004:'Step right up! Have a look! I've got \nsome stuff here you won't wanna miss!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!'
273005,273006:'Step right up! Have a look! I've got \nonly the freshest wares in stock!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!'
273007,273008:'Step right up! Have a \nlook! Piping hot and right \nout of the oven!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!'
273009,273010:'Step right up! Have a look! \nEverything you see was \ncaught fresh today!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!'
273011,273012:'Step right up! Have \na look! Fresh off \nthe griddle!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!'
273013,273014:'Step right up! Have a look! \nOnly the most succulent \nmorsels available here!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!'
273015,273016:'Step right up! Have a look! \nEverything here came straight \nfrom the sea!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!'
273017,273020,273023,273026,273029,273032,273035:'Hello and welcome. We're \nhere to meet your needs, \neven at night.'
273019,273022,273025,273028,273031,273034,273037:'We appreciate your business.'
273038:'This warehouse functions as a storage facility \nfor Fortune's Market's merchandise.<PAGE>What's up? Are you here to help \norganize the inventory?'
273039:'This is the Fortune's \nMarket stock warehouse. <PAGE>You'd better not be thinking \nof stealing from here!'
273040:'This is Fortune's Market's \nmerchandise warehouse.<PAGE>The President took some items out recently, \nso I'm looking for someone to help \nreorganize. What do you say?'
273041:'The President just took out a \nbig shipment of items she said \nwere headed for Nordopolica.<PAGE>I've got to get this place cleaned up, but I don't want \nto do it alone. Think you might want to lend a hand?'
273042:'This warehouse functions as a storage facility \nfor Fortune's Market's merchandise.<PAGE>Thanks to the trouble in Dahngrest, \nwe're short on people. Think you \nmight want to lend a hand?'
273043:'This is the Fortune's \nMarket stock warehouse. <PAGE>Get out of here \nunless you want me \ntocall the Knights!'
273044,273046:'This warehouse functions as a storage \nfacility for Fortune's Market.<PAGE>I'm having a hard time getting enough \nhelp around here. You know how \nit is. Why not lend a hand?'
273045,273047:'I put up a help wanted \nflyer a while back...<PAGE>It didn't seem to do much good though. \nThings are still pretty chaotic in here... \nThink you might want to lend a hand?'
273048:'This warehouse functions as a storage \nfacility for Fortune's Market.<PAGE>We were finally able to get our next shipment \nof goods, but the warehouse is still a bit of \na mess. Think you could help clean things up?'
273049:'This is the Fortune's \nMarket stock warehouse. <PAGE>I guard this warehouse like \na wall of iron! Not one \nthief will get passed me!'
273050:'This warehouse functions as a storage \nfacility for Fortune's Market.<PAGE>Word's come down that we're shipping goods to some town \nthat's picked up a bunch of refugees from the capital. \nThink you might help us get things in order?'
273051:'From what I hear, Fortune's Market \nis leading the push to send goods \nto the southern continent.<PAGE>It's my job to make sure the inventory \nhere's all present and accounted \nfor. How's a bout lending a hand?'
273052:'We can't run our \nLiner at night... <PAGE>Sorry!'
273053,273055,273057,273059,273061,273063:'Welcome to the the world class \nTrino Ferry, man. Let us know \nif you need a ride, okay?'
273054:'Man, our ferry, the Stratos is in the shop \nright now gettin' a tune up, ya know?<PAGE>Hate to tell you this, man, but we're \nnot launching any boats right now.'
273056:'Hey man, I don't know what the \ndeal is, but the Stratos hasn't \ncome back from Nor Harbor.<PAGE>So, like, the ferry service is \ntaking a little break, you dig?'
273058:'The Trino Ferry guild is fully \ninto the justice scene, man.<PAGE>We're gonna load the Stratos up \nwith refugees, man, and just run \nthat baby as fast as she'll go.'
273060:'Here at the Trino Ferry, we've got \na bulletproof driving record, man.<PAGE>We figure the sea's pretty choppy \nright now though, so we're puttin' \nthe ferry service on hold, man.'
273062:'Things are sorta touch and go out there \nin the wide world right now, so we've gotta \nhold off on the ferry service, man.<PAGE>Wonder how long it'll be 'til \nwe can launch the boats again.'
273064:'So, we're finally trying our hands \nat something new. Our guild's gotten \ninto the shipping business, man.<PAGE>To be honest though, I \nliked the boats that carried \npeople better... '
273065:'Anyway, man, welcome to the world class \nTrino Transport. Let us know if there's \nanything you need shipped, okay?'
273066:'I've heard tell of a funny-lookin' boat that's \nbeen out sailin' the seas, lately. It's all \nbeat up, and looks like it's got no crew...<PAGE>If you're headin' out on the deep blue, \nI'd keep my eyes peeled if I was you.'
273067:'There's still a great many mysteries \nout on the briny deep, ya know.'
273068:'That beat up old ship'll give ya a scare, and \nthen you've got the mer-men ta worry about.<PAGE>They'll come at ya in great numbers, \nand pull anybody they can \ndown to a watery grave.'
273069:'If you're plannin' ta ride the rollin' waves, \nI'd warn ya ta keep a good lookout for funny-lookin' \nboats and the mer-men, both.'
273071:'The sea be full'o \nterrifying creatures...\nBut this is the attraction o' the mighty sea.'
273074:'Now that the Don's passed on I'll \nbet Dahngrest is in a real pickle.<PAGE>At least we've got Fortune's \nMarket here, so we should be \nable ta weather the storm.'
273075:'Not ta worry, I tell ya. \nWe've got President Kaufman \nhere, after all.<PAGE>Might not be a bad idea for you to put \ndown roots in this town yourselves.'
273076:'I've seen it for myself, now. 'Course \nI'm talkin' about the freaky action \ngoin' on in the sky over the capital.<PAGE>I mean, wow. Thank the stars they built that \ncity on the other side of the ocean, huh?'
273077:'Those people in the capital have gotta be havin' a nasty time \nof it. Not that there's a whole lot we can do from here.'
273078:'I've heard somethin' came bubblin' \nup outta the middle of the ocean.<PAGE>Hey, what about that old beat up ship?! \nI'll betcha anything it's got \nsomethin' ta do with that boat.'
273079:'The Knights'll probably do somethin' \nor other about it, though.'
273080:'This town's fixin' ta bust at the seams, but \nit's nothin' ta get too worked up over.<PAGE>My guess is the Knights'll step in \nbefore things get too outta hand.'
273081:'Heh, we'll be all right \nunless that thing decides \nta belly flop on us.'
273082:'Heyo, you got any idea what the \ndeal is with that big ol' building \nis over toward Ilyccia?<PAGE>Sounds like that thing's so tall, the top of \nit's hidin' up there in the clouds somewhere.'
273083:'Man, just what the heck is that thing? Ya think \nit's some sorta observation tower, maybe?'
273084:'Our guild's hideout is \nway off on the western \nside of this continent.<PAGE>It's a little place called Dahngrest! \nYou should check it out sometime.'
273085:'Come to think of it, the mercenaries had \na town somewhere up in the northwest. \nWait, they might've abandoned that one.'
273086:'The city of Nordopolica on the \ncontinent of Desier is ruled by \na guild known as Palestralle.<PAGE>They're mainly in charge of \nrunning the coliseum there.'
273087:'They're pretty much the only \nguild that runs a town.<PAGE>Some say that Heaven's Arrow runs \nthings in Dahngrest, but technically \nspeaking it's the guild Union.'
273088:'Fortune's Market has got the \nUnion to thank for their cozy \nrelationship with the empire.<PAGE>There's no telling if the guilds could even \nkeep going if the Don were ever to die, 'cause \nthe balance of power would just crumble...'
273089:'The empire would bring the hammer down \non the guilds in no time at all.<PAGE>And if that happened, they'd \nstrengthen their hold even \non towns like this. '
273090:'The death of the Don and Belius... I always thought \nif the two pillars of the guild community \nfell, the empire would crush us in no time.<PAGE>I never thought it'd cause this \nrebellion among the Knights...'
273091:'This should buy the guilds some time to \nrecover from the loss, and get ready to \npush back against the empire if need be.'
273092:'Knights fighting other Knights, huh...? \nSounds like the empire's got pretty \nbig problems of its own.<PAGE>And the Union can't seem to agree \non anything, now that they've got \nnobody to bind them together.'
273093:'With the Don out of the picture, \nmaybe this is a time for major \nchanges in the guilds.'
273094:'Perhaps you were unaware, but this \nis a tropical species of plant particular \nto the Tolbyccian continent.<PAGE>It is quite common for heavy \nrains to fall here, you see.'
273095:'If you proceed further to the west, \nyou will surely guess this continent's \ndefining character.'
273096:'This continent sees quite a lot of \nrainfall, but conversely, the continent \nof Desier sees almost none.'
273097:'With Desier as hot as it is, \nits lack of rain makes the \nclimate doubly harsh.'
273098:'Have you ever been to the \ndeserts of Desier? Oh, you \nhave? How remarkable.'
273099:'Is it true that the \ncactuses there are \na source of water?'
273100,273102:'The skies above Ilyccia seem \nparticularly strange.'
273101,273103:'The weather has been rather \nunpredictable lately.'
273104,273106:'W-whatever can that be in the sky? \nIt's nothing I'm familiar with.'
273105,273107:'This is no time to be thinking about how \nmuch it might rain in a given place.'
273110:'What's to be done \nwith the world now? <PAGE>There isn't a single person left among the elite of the Guilds or the \nKnights who can tackle that question.'
273111:'All us bottom-\nfeeders can do \nis worry...'
273112,273116,273118,273120,273122,273124:'This is Fortune Market's \nhome office.'
273113:'It would be best not \nto visit after dark.'
273114:'This is the head office \nof Fortune's Market. <PAGE>President Kaufman is \nnot in at the moment.'
273115:'I mentioned to the President \nthat I thought her first \nname, Mary, was cute.<PAGE>She cut my pay in half.'
273117:'The President seems to be quite busy with her work.'
273119:'I wonder if the President will be staying \nat the office tonight as well.'
273121:'The President keeps at her work \nregardless of the hour.'
273123,273125:'Sometimes, I wonder when the President finds any time to sleep.'
273126:'All sorts of guilds claim this town \nas their base of operations.<PAGE>Out of all of them though, the \nBlood Alliance is said to be \nthe most powerful. But um...'
273127:'Hmm, I don't see any \nof the Alliance's mercenaries \naround...'
273128:'Barbos, the head of the Blood Alliance \nis a man that clawed his way to \nthe top through sheer skill. <PAGE>The rumors say he \nwas murdered. Could \nthat be true?'
273129:'Barbos was domineering, arrogant, \nand selfish, but he was \ncertainly an able man. <PAGE>I'd like to know who \ncould take down that \nkind of a man.'
273130:'In the past, the mercenaries \nwould always go out to do \ntheir work when night fell.'
273131:'I wonder how much this town's been changed \nby the absence of the Blood Alliance.'
273132:'Sounds like something pretty big happened in \nthe capital, but it doesn't look like it's got \nanything to do with us here in Torim Harbor.'
273133:'I'm curious to see how the Union's going \nto manage now that they've lost the Don.'
273134:'I hear the empire's having to deal with \nsome sort of internal problems.'
273135:'Which reminds me, I also heard someone \nsay that a young knight's been cooperating \nwith one or another of the guilds.'
273136:'Just look at that hideous \nbeast in the sky. If only \nwe still had the Don... <PAGE>Alone we cannot defeat \nthat terrible monster \nin the sky...'
273137:'And now the \nDon is gone, too... <PAGE>Oh, such a cruel and \nheartless world...'
273138:'Even on a night such as this, \nI can see the monster in the sky. <PAGE>It sure is spooky.'
273139:'Suppose there's no way one or two \npeople could go up against that \nsky monster alone and win.'
273140,273142:'I'm not sleepy. Not sleepy \nat all. I'm an adult now.'
273141,273143:'*Yawn*...Getting sleepy...'
273144,273146:'*Snore*... Sir!<PAGE>I've mastered the art of sleeping standing up!'
273145,273147:'*Snore*...'
273148,273164,273166:'It's been pretty rough around here lately, \nyou'd all best run along home now.'
273149,273165,273167:'I'm sure your mommy's worried sick.'
273150:'My best friend moved \naway to a town \ncalled Heliord.<PAGE>Mama says it's a new town \nthe Umpire just builded.'
273151:'We were writing letters back and \nforth, and then the letters stopped \ncoming. I wonder why that is...'
273152:'What do you think the new town \nthe Umpire builded is like?'
273153:'My best friend in Heliord finally \nsent me a reply. She said there \nwas a big problem there.'
273154:'This man named Don had to go away forever. \nThe grown-ups were all running around \ntalking about it. I'm okay, though.'
273155:'How can you be a good grown-up if you \nget sad about every little thing?'
273156:'All the grown-ups are saying that something \nbad happened in the capital. I'm \nnot too worried about it, though.'
273157:'How can you be a good grown-up if \nyou worry about every little thing?'
273158:'All the grown-ups said really loud that \nsomething came out of the ocean. But \nthat won't do anything bad to us.'
273159:'How can you be a good grown-up if \nyou yell about every little thing?'
273160,273162:'The grown-ups are scared and they \nsaid that's a big monster in the sky. \nI'm a little bit scared, too.'
273161,273163:'Do you think somebody will make \nthat bad monster go away?'
273168,273170:'There's nothing quite like being lulled \nto sleep by the whispering of the waves.'
273169,273171:'It's one of the true joys of travel.'
273172,273174:'When the sun breaks over the \nhorizon, tomorrow picks up \nwhere today leaves off.'
273173,273175:'I wonder how the gang back at Dahngrest \nwill fare without the Don around.'
273176:'I heard that the Knights \nare on fire trying ta \nget some ships ready.'
273177:'Can they be thinking of trying to board that \nbuilding that surfaced out in the ocean?'
273178:'Back in my day, any man who \ncalled himself a sailor had \nsome real gumption in 'im.<PAGE>They don't make 'em like that \nanymore, I'll tell you what!'
273179:'Maybe I'm gonna hafta stage a comeback \nhere pretty soon; show these whippersnappers \nhow it's done!'
273180:'Men are born ta live \non the sea! And \nta die on it!'
273181:'The sea's a damn good thing!'
273182:'I was proud as could be, the day \nthe Don took a ride in my boat.'
273183:'You rest in peace \nout there, Don.'
273184:'I got word somethin' big \nwent down on Ilyccia.'
273185:'I don't know much about what happens across the \nwater, though. I'm too busy tryin' ta figure \nout what's goin' on in front of my own eyes.'
273186:'Some knights came lookin' \nta hire a few top-notch \nsailors. Hmm...'
273187:'If it's top-notch they need, why \ndidn't they come talkin' ta me?'
273188,273190:'Not even I can steer \na ship inta the sky.'
273189,273191:'I suppose I'll let the youngsters \ntake a crack at that beast.'
273192:'Hoh hoh hoh. Aren't the ships just \ngrand? Board a boat and you can \nsee the world, I always say.<PAGE>The thrill! The mystery! \nThe spectacle of it all!'
273193,273195,273197,273199,273201,273203,273205:'Don't you have a ship of your own? \nMy, well that just won't do.'
273194:'Hoh hoh hoh. Aren't ships just \ngrand? Board a boat and you can \nsee the world, I always say.<PAGE>Miracles! Wonders waiting just \nover the edge of every horizon!'

273200:'Hoh hoh hoh. Aren't ships just \ngrand? Board a boat and you \ncan see the world, I always \nsay. You can come along! \nAnd you! And you too!'
273202:'Hoh hoh hoh. Aren't ships just \ngrand? Board a boat and you \ncan see the world, I always \nsay. A sail on the ocean \nblue! For me and for you!'
273204:'Hoh hoh hoh. Aren't ships just \ngrand? Board a boat and you \ncan see the world, I always \nsay. Monsters! Buildings! \nIt's all part of the deal!'
273206,273208:'I heard that the Knights have \nbeen in a big hurry getting \nships together.'
273210:'The murmuring tides stir up \nthoughts of loves I've known. <PAGE>Oh, Larry. \nI wonder just what you \nmight be thinking now.'
273211,273213:'Oh, Larry. I wonder \njust what you might \nbe thinking now.'
273212:'What could my sweet \nheart be up to now? <PAGE>Ah, how my mind \nwanders to you \nat night...'
273214:'My love and I promised \nourselves to one another \nin front of the lighthouse. <PAGE>We swore we'd return \nto one another, even \nif we were separated.'
273215,273217:'We swore we'd return to one another, \neven if we were separated.'
273216:'Love lost so long ago, still yet to return...But \nhis thoughts come floating on the sea \nbreeze, returning to the port today. <PAGE>Ah the sea breeze \nembraces me!'
273218:'I wonder where you might be now, \nand what you're doing there.'
273219,273221,273223:'I can't help thinking of our times together, \nLarry, when I gaze out at the sea.'
273220:'I’m sure you’re thinking \nof me, way across \nthe sea. <PAGE>Yes, I’m sure you are.'
273222:'Come to me on swift wings! \nSave me from the horrors \nbesetting the world! <PAGE>Hey, he will come won’t he...? \nOf course he will!'
273224:'If you travel to the south from the port by boat, the \ncontinent of Desier will appear on your right. You'll \nalso be able to see Hypionia off to the left.<PAGE>There's a city with a coliseum \non Desier. That's something \nI'd like to go and see...'
273225:'The coliseum: your blood singing with excitement, \na parade of flesh dancing before your eyes... I'd \nlove to see it all for myself, even just once.'
273226:'A guild called Palestralle \nmanages things at \nthe coliseum.'
273227:'Don't you think it's sort of awesome \nthat there's a guild that specializes \nin running a coliseum?'
273228:'When it's nighttime here, it must \nbe night at the coliseum, too.'
273229:'At least the coliseum and I both exist \nunderneath the same big sky.'
273230:'*Sigh* \nI want to go to the coliseum so much...<PAGE>If only I could, \nI would swim the \nsea to get there...'
273231:'I couldn't swim 10 feet if my life depended on it, though.'
273232:'The world is ever-changing. Perhaps \nthe light house will illuminate \nmy way forward today as well.'
273233:'I swear, something about the nighttime \nbrings out the poet in me.'
273234,273236,273238:'See the barrier blastia there? \nThere's another one just like \nit over in Nor Harbor.<PAGE>Of course, these two were once part \nof a set of three, with the third being \nout on the ocean in Capua Duo.'
273235,273237,273239:'It's on account of that barrier \nblastia that our lives are comfortable \nand free from worry.'
273240,273242:'No matter what might happen, the \nbarrier's sure to protect us.'
273241,273243,273245,273247:'It's on account of the barrier \nblastia that our lives are comfortable \nand free from worry.'
273244,273246:'No matter what might happen, \nthe barrier's sure to \nprotect us. I hope...'
273248,273250:'Quite a few of us here bid farewell \nto the men who rowed out \nto sea in the boats...<PAGE>Not a single one of them has been \nheard from since, though...'
273249,273251:'Hmph... They've all found some \npretty young girl in another town \nby now, I'm sure of it...!'
273252:'The Don, now there was an honest to goodness man.'
273253:'It's always the good ones that \nhave to go first, while the dirtbags \nseem to live forever.'
273254,273256:'Seems like this whole world \nis primed and ready to go \nup like a powder keg.'
273255,273257:'I doubt there'll ever be another \none quite like him.'
273258,273260:'I'd have been better off kicking the bucket \na ways back if I knew a monster like \nthis was gonna show up in the sky.'
273259,273261:'I wonder if we're really even safe inside the town.'
273262,273265,273268,273271,273274,273277,273280:'Good evening. It will be 300 Gald \nif you'd like to stay the night. \nWill you be staying with us?'
273264,273267,273270,273273,273276,273279,273282:'Thank you very much. Take \ncare, and have a nice day.'
273284,273286,273312,273314:'Why bother with those clumsy boys around the way when \nyou could spend some time with the genuine article?'
273287,273315:'Men these days just have no fight in them, and they're \nboring to boot. It's enough to drive a girl crazy.'
273288,273316:'We humans are all gonna die someday. \nThe Don, me, and you too, sweetie.'
273289,273317,273319:'When you're down in the dumps, the only \nthing to do is party the blues away. \nCome on, why not take a walk with me?'
273290,273292,273318,273320:'Oh, and here I was gonna show \nyou such a good time.'
273291:'I thought the Commandant was \njust the Empire's dog... <PAGE>But he really \nproved his worth \nin the rebellion!'
273294,273296,273322,273324:'Hey, what do you say? Wanna \nhave a little fun?'
273295,273321,273323:'If we're fated to die no matter what we do, there's nothing \nfor it but to enjoy life right down to the last breath.'
273297,273299,273325,273327:'I got myself good and lost in some ruins while \nI was wandering around in the woods.<PAGE>And that's where I heard this \nmonster howling. Most bone-chilling \nthing you ever heard.'
273298,273326:'I'll bet my life that it was none other \nthan the legendary creature, Uma.'
273300,273328:'Nobody much wants to believe that \nthis Uma creature exists, though.'
273301:'There are still monsters<PAGE>in this world even the Hunting Blades<PAGE>don't know about.<PAGE>Euma is one of them!'
273302,273306,273330,273332,273334:'And the Uma's a prime example!'
273307,273335,273337:'That's it! It's the \nlegendary Uma!'
273308,273310,273336,273338:'Did you see it, huh?! That'll \nshow all you naysayers who \nsaid it wasn't real!'
273309:'Verily...... \nHmm.... \nIs that really a Euma......?<PAGE>Are there really such \nthings as Eumas...?'
273311,273313:'Hey there handsome, wouldn't \nyou like to hold hands \nwith my sisters and I?<PAGE>You're sorely mistaken if you \nthink we're just your average \ngirls next door, though.∀'
273329,273331,273333:'There's plenty of monsters left in \nthis world that not even the Hunting \nBlades know a thing about.'
273339,273341:'Dag nabbit!! That granddaughter of \nmine's done it again! This time she \ntook my ship and went out to sea!<PAGE>And as a bonus, she even \nblew up the engine! This \nis the last straw.'
273340,273342:'What did I ever do to deserve \na granddaughter who's so obsessed \nwith the ocean...?!'
273343,273345,273347:'Everybody knows the sea's not a force to \nbe trifled with, but try telling that \nto my dunder brain of a granddaughter.'
273344,273346,273348:'It's gonna take her gettin' \nherself killed, before she \ncomes to her senses.'
273349,273351:'That fool-headed granddaughter of mine's \ngone out to sea again. Never mind that blasted \nmonster hanging up there in the sky.'
273350,273352:'World's never seen a more stubborn girl. I \njust can't figure out who she got it from.'
273353,273355:'That senile old man's forgotten \nthat he's the one who \ngave me my boat!<PAGE>If he's gonna give it to me, \nshouldn't I be the one who \ndecides what I do with it?!'
273354,273356:'Besides, he's the one to \nblame for me liking the \nsea as much as I do...'
273357,273359,273361:'Of course I know all about the ocean being \na dangerous place, and all that.'
273358,273360,273362:'But dangerous or not, \nthere's some things a \ngirl's just gotta do.'
273363,273365:'I've got to go out on the ocean, even if Grandpa's \ndead set against it. I'm trying to make \na lifelong dream come true out there.'
273364,273366:'I'm carrying on the dreams my \ngrandpa had, back in the days \nwhen he was still a sailor.'
273367,273369:'My daughter and my old dad get into it \nwith each other at the drop of a hat.<PAGE>You'd think they'd get along so well... I guess \nthey're just a little too much of the same kind.'
273368,273370:'Besides, it isn't as \nif they don't really \ncare for each other.'
273371,273373,273375:'They'd understand one another better if they could just talk \nthings out, but they're both stubborn as stone. Whoever heard \nof granddaughter and grandpa who do nothing but fight?'
273372,273374,273376:'I think they're both just too afraid of \ntalking to each other face to face.'
273377,273379:'Even I'll admit that I'm not thrilled \nto have my daughter out on the \nwater in these conditions...'
273378,273380:'She's never been a girl who listens to \nanything but her own heart, though.'
273381:'Well now, we met back at \nDeidon Hold, did we not?<PAGE>Have you changed your mind \nabout working for me?'
273382:'After we met, the Hold was reopened \nand I was able to get back to town.<PAGE>If it had been even a little later, I wouldn't have \nbeen able to cross the sea because of the storms.'
273383,273384,273397,273398,273411,273412:'※It may be better not to place Kaufman here.'
273385:'With a person such as that, you don't \nrealize how valuable they truly \nare until after they're gone.'
273386:'It's only now that I can see just how big \na hole the Don created when he went away.'
273387:'But business goes on. Fortune's Market's got \nto continue living up to its reputation, \nand rake that money in by the boat load.'
273388:'If you spend all your time worrying \nabout the people that aren't with us \nanymore, you'll never get anywhere.'
273389:'The empire is in a state of disarray at the \nmoment. But helping them clean up the mess \nis going to mean booming business for us.'
273390:'Hmm, the Knights or the future emperor? Which do \nyou think will perform better in the long term? \nWhich sounds like the better investment to you?'
273391,273393:'With the world gone mad like this, there's no real point \nworrying about things like running a business.'
273392,273394:'We've been sending relief supplies to all the affected \nregions, and that's cost us a pretty penny.<PAGE>We should work together to \nrecover our losses in the \nfuture, don't you think?'
273395:'This is Fortune Market's \nhome office.<PAGE>The President's busy right \nnow. Don't be a nuisance.'
273396:'This is Fortune Market's \nhome office.<PAGE>Leave the president alone. \nYou'd only be in the way.'
273399:'Don's death is beginning to \ntake it's toll on Fortune's \nMarket in numerous ways.'
273400:'The President's been even more busy than usual, since \nit happened. Make sure not to get in her way.'
273401:'The President can smell a good business \nopportunity from a mile away.'
273402:'The President's in the middle of sealing a crucial deal \ntoday. You'd better not make a nuisance of yourselves.'
273403:'If there's power in military might, then there's just \nas much power in things like trade and finance. Fortune's \nMarket can use things like that to move mountains.'
273404:'The President's been in a good mood today. But don't \ngo getting any ideas about interrupting her work.'
273405,273407:'The President is quite the humanitarian. \nI think that's what I \nlike best about her.'
273406,273408:'I doubt she'll ask to be repaid \nfor all she's done once \npeace finally returns...'
273409:'...Life is pretty sweet \nhere in this town...<PAGE>The people are friendly, the temperature's \njust about right, and above all...we've \ngot the President...'
273410:'...I'd prefer if you kept this on the down low, but...<PAGE>I think the President \nsmells really nice...'
273413,273415,273417,273419,273421:'Another day spent at the President's side. \nThere is no joy greater than this.'
273414:'...I'd prefer if you kept this on the down low, but...<PAGE>The President won't wear anything she thinks makes her look fat.'
273416:'...I'd prefer if you kept this on the down low, but...<PAGE>The President goes absolutely livid \nif anyone calls her "ma'am."'
273418:'...I'd prefer if you kept this on the down low, but...<PAGE>The President loves all things having to do with money.'
273420:'...I'd prefer if you kept this on the down low, but...<PAGE>The President has no interest in getting married.'
273422:'...I'd prefer if you kept this on the down low, but...<PAGE>The President never takes off her glasses.'
273423,273425,273427,273429,273431:'What business do you have at this hour? <PAGE>This is Aspio. If you wish \nto enter, I'll need \nto see your passport.'
273424:'We don't get many visitors \nfrom the outside, here.<PAGE>This town's full of mages who've got \nnothing but research on the brain.<PAGE>I feel like I'm gonna go nuts, \nfenced in by all these weirdos.'
273426:'Nighttime or noon, it makes no difference to these \nresearchers. They're all nutty as fruitcakes.'
273428:'Some truly savage monsters come \nout at night. You've been warned.'
273430:'The color of the sky seems odd off \nin the direction of the capital.<PAGE>Wonder if everything's okay.'
273432:'There've been no orders from the capital... \nWhat could've happened to the Knights?'
273433,273435,273437,273439,273441:'This facility is under the direct jurisdiction \nof the empire. Please be on your \nway if you have no business here.'
273434,273436,273438,273440,273442:'If you've lost your way, you can reach Halure by heading to the \nsouthwest, and you'll find Deidon Hold directly to the south.<PAGE>It's gotten pretty \nlate. Take care, \nand stick to \nthe roads.'
273443,273446,273449,273452,273455:'Take a rest for 100 Gald? It is \na bookshelf, you understand.'
273445,273448,273451,273454,273457,273565,273568,273571,273574,273577:'We're used to it around here, but you \nmay find it a bit stiff if it's your \nfirst time. Stop back anytime.'
273459,273461:'Oh, wonderful! Now I've lost my concentration. \nYou're quite disturbing my research, you know. \nPerhaps you could...go somewhere else?'
273463:'Okay, that's it! I was so close...I \nsimply can't think with you \ntalking to me like that!!'
273465:'Are you kidding me?! You again?! \nDon't talk to me right now, this \nis the most important part!!'
273467:'I've completed the system of calculations!! \nI've done it!! ...Huh? Where \ndid all you people come from?<PAGE>...Huh? When did it \nget so dark? Did \nsomething happen?'
273468:'Sorry, but I'm afraid we can't let you handle \nthe blastia just because it's nighttime.'
273469:'Well, it doesn't matter whether it's \nnight or day for us researchers!! <PAGE> Well... It's more like it doesn't \nmatter in this town...'
273470:'You... You're the ones that snuck into the \nruins, aren't you? You can't have anything \nnice without amateurs mucking it up.'
273471:'We were the ones given rights to enter \nthose ruins... Curse that Mordio, she's \nbeaten us to the punch once again...'
273472:'You caught that blastia thief, as well, right? I don't \nsee Mordio around, either. Oh, whatever will happen \nto the results of her precious research...? Tee-hee.♪'
273473:'If she doesn't get her results together \nand publish them soon...'
273474,273475:'The sky's turned an odd color?<PAGE>Well, it is night, right? Of course \nit's going to look different.'
273476,273477:'You say we're in danger? What \nare you even talking about?<PAGE>The blastia we're excavating now are showing \nmore activity than ever before. This is \nthe perfect chance to run experiments!'
273478,273480,273482,273484,273486:'Zzz.'
273479:'I'll never let anyone...have my \nblastia... *Mumble, grumble...*'
273481:'Whoa...do I actually think the \nblastia on Ehmead Hill is...cute? \n*Mumble, mumble...*'
273483:'Man...those guys in the \nKnights...are so cool. \n*Mumble, mumble...*'
273485:'Is the barrier malfunctioning...or \ndid it just stop working? \n*Mumble, mumble..."'
273487:'Research... \nMust do more research... \n*Mumble, mumble...*'
273488:'It's pretty rare for Mordio \nto cooperate with anyone.'
273490,273491:'What does Halure having \nbeautiful nights have to \ndo with blastia research? <PAGE>Or are you trying to say \nsomething about this town...?'
273492:'If the blastia are in good condition, our \nresearch can progress. ...Huh? It's night \nalready? I'll keep going a while longer.'
273493,273578:'The blastia we're digging \nup here were made by the \nKrityans eons ago.'
273494,273495:'An abnormal environment in the capital..... \nI wonder if this is caused by \nthe aer abnormality? '
273496,273497:'I wonder if there are fewer guards at night? \nMaybe I could even sneak into \nthat closed-off area... *Mumble, mumble*'
273498:'Hmm...? \nThe management list and the number of Blastia \ndon't match..... '
273499:'My mistake? \nI've been so forgetful \nlately...'
273500:'It's so rare to have brought Mordio \nwith you. \n'
273501:'Are you guys chasing something like the Blastia again? '
273502,273504:'If Mordio is not here, the research \ndoesn't go smoothly and I get stressed out.  '
273503:'Can you get your business \nwrapped up earlier? <PAGE>I want you to help my research \nas soon as possible. '
273505:'Are you researching on the abnormality of the \nShield Blastia that is the barrier of the capital? '
273506:'Lately, \nthe Blastia on the hillside shows abnormal figures, \nalthough...... '
273507:'If you have time to spare, why don't you check on \nthe Blastia on the hillside. '
273508:'The Blastia excavated here \nwere all made by the Kritya \nlong, long ago.'
273509,273579:'Just once I'd like to have a nice, long \ntalk with one of the Krityan technicians \nabout blastia construction.'
273510,273580:'Halure? Yeah, it's known for having the textbook \nexample of an organic-type blastia.<PAGE>What about it?'
273511,273581:'We spend all our time inside the city, so \nwe're a bit out of touch with the world.<PAGE>Not that I'm dying to know what's happening out there.'
273512,273582:'Saying that though, somebody had to \nput all these blastia we're digging \nup into the ground at some point...<PAGE>I wonder if it was done for some special reason?'
273513,273583:'Hey, would you mind leaving \nme alone? I'm busy thinking \nabout blastia right now.'
273514,273584:'Why would they bury \nthe blastia...? \nHmm, I wonder.<PAGE>...Did they become unusable? \nBut how could that happen?'
273515,273585:'How could they just give up using \nsomething that brings such convenience \nand abundance to our lives...?'
273516,273586:'Wait, what's up with this? These numbers \ncan't be right! There's something \nfishy about the recent data!!<PAGE>All my work, my precious work!!'
273517,273587:'Astounding. These results will overturn \nsomething people have been accepting as \nfact for far too long. It's incredible!!'

273707:'Listen to this. I made 200,000 \nGald just by following the \nadvice this man gave me!<PAGE>Oh, Itoken, thank goodness \nI believed in you!'

273715:'I lost... I lost it all... \nWhat sort of betting \nbusiness is this?<PAGE>Oh no... Have I \nbeen swindled?'
273716:'Perhaps I'll have a chance to make it \nall back somewhere down the road...'
273717:'This tipster here, name of Itoken, \nonce gave me a tip on a bet \nthat paid off 100,000 to one.<PAGE>I went ahead and made the bet even though \nI thought it was a scam. Imagine my \nsurprise when that thing paid off.'

273719:'This man's got a pretty sly tongue. Even if \nyou lose, he ends up making you feel you did \nthe right thing, that it's not your fault.<PAGE>I'm a pretty special piece of \nwork myself for getting sucked \nin time after time, though.'
273720:'This noble woman here is really \nlayin' down the big bucks. Maybe \nI should take a chance myself.<PAGE>Just think how great it'd be if \nI could pay off all that debt.'

273727:'There, ya see? Missed again... This tipster's \nnothin' but a lump of bad luck.<PAGE>Still, my luck's gotta turn sometime, right? I swear, \nI envy anyone too stupid to do what I'm doing.'
273728:'When I stop and think about it, this crook \nof a tipster's not losin' out at all.<PAGE>His predictions might be off, but \nhe's still takin' our money.'
273729:'I'm at the end of life's road anyway. If I can \nstrike it rich just once more, I'll have a nice \nsouvenir to take with me to the next world.<PAGE>But it'll never pay off. \nThis darned tipster knows \njust what I'm thinkin'.'
273730:'The time of reckoning's at hand. If it's \nall goin' up in flames anyway, why \nshould I be afraid to go bankrupt?'

273735:'That's the Coliseum \nCity for you! I can \nsee fights every day! <PAGE>It's wonderful! \nJust wonderful!'
273739:'At one point, it got so wild \nin there, I thought people were \ngoing to start screaming.<PAGE>I wish I could have seen that. \nThe more screaming, the more the \nexcitement, don't you think?'
273740:'Covered in blood, burnt to a crisp, torn \nto shreds, 'til there's nothing left... \nIt sends a thrill right down my spine.<PAGE>My tastes run a bit to the \ngrotesque, you see.♪'

273743:'A battle between a giant monster and the \nhumans... If they were planning on staging \nthis fight, why didn't anyone tell me?<PAGE>Someone apparently went for it not too long \nago. They jumped on the monster's back.'
273744:'Now that you've come all this \nway, aren't you in the mood to \nsee something really awful?'
273745:'I'm afraid I've become thoroughly \naddicted to the charms \nof the coliseum.<PAGE>So, I've made up my mind to live \nright here. I've got to save \nevery last Gald that I can.'
273746:'I left my husband behind when I came here, \nbut I'm not worried about him in the least.<PAGE>Coliseums before \nspouses! '

273748:'I left my husband behind when \nI came here, but he's lost in \nhis own hobbies, so we're even.'
273749:'I left my husband behind in \norder to see the coliseum. I \nguess I am a little worried.<PAGE>Is he eating his dinner like he should? \nIs he cleaning up after himself?'

273753:'I may not be from here originally, \nbut I've quite settled in, and I've \neven made plenty of friends.<PAGE>My greatest pleasure is \nstill the coliseum though, \nwithout a doubt. '

273758:'I like going to the matches by myself, \nbut perhaps I'd enjoy the coliseum even \nmore if he were here to watch with me.'
273760:'Howls of anguish in the air...\nbrother against brother...\npearlescent showers of blood...the mad roar of the crowd...It would be so delicious!<PAGE>I'm just kidding. \nJust kidding!♪'

273803:'You guys are travelers, right? Lemme \ntell you straight up, this continent \nain't worth your time.<PAGE>There's a road, but it dead ends at a mountain. There's a \ncave too, but it's chock-full of monsters. Plus, there's nothing \nbut sand and jagged peaks waitin' on the other side.'

273807:'You say Belius has died? Okay, now \nthings are gonna get interesting.<PAGE>Belius' existence was the thing that \nreally kept this town together.'
273808:'Those Knights just keep on pouring in, one right \nafter the other, don't they? Wonder how Palestralle's \ngonna dig themselves outta this one.<PAGE>This is awful, but it's also awesome. \nI'm gonna be so busy, hah hah.'
273809:'What's all this? Everybody seems to have \nquieted down a fair bit. Boring, I say.<PAGE>Or maybe it's that the Knights are \nputtin' their fears at ease.'
273810:'The people here turned out \nto have even less fight in 'em \nthan I'd have guessed. <PAGE>I also assumed Belius \nhad much more of a \nfollowing than this.'
273811:'Ah hah hah. Now where the hell do you \nsuppose a monster like that comes from. \nNice, this is shapin' up nicely.<PAGE>What's that? The end of the world? \nHah hah, aw heck, why not?'
273812:'They can wipe this town, or even \nthe whole ball of wax clean off \nthe map for all I care. Hmph.'
273813:'It sounds like there's a fair \nbit of trouble over on Ilyccia.<PAGE>We've got both the sea and the sky getting \ninto the act now. How festive. I've got \nit, let's have a parade! Ah hah hah!'
273814:'...Okay even I can't keep it up anymore. \nJust what was I going on about, anyway?<PAGE>I feel like I'll have to \nface all my fears if I don't \nkeep blabbering on...'
273815:'The monster that guarded over \nthis town has been vanquished.<PAGE>If those who did this truly belong \nto one of the Union's guilds, \nthey are a barbaric lot indeed.'
273816:'If that truly was the \nguardian spirit then \nthis town is doomed.'
273818:'Now we've lost both Belius and the guardian \nspirit. It's hopeless to think we can \nrely on the Knights to protect us here.'
273819:'Natz is doing his best \nto fill in as provisional \nDuce of Nordopolica.<PAGE>Unlike Belius, he appears before \nthe people frequently, and \nfeels closer to us somehow.'
273820:'He lacks some of Belius' \ncharisma, though we \nsaw much less of her.'
273821:'Natz is pouring his heart into the \nwork of keeping this town safe.<PAGE>Now the people need to rally \nbehind him as one.'
273822:'There isn't much I know of other towns. \nBut I'll be satisfied if Nordopolica \ncan be at peace, of that I'm sure.'
273823:'I came to Desier to explore the lands \nto the west of here and search \nfor my heritage as a Krityan.<PAGE>But the road through the \nmountains is out, and \nI was denied passage.'
273824:'If only I could conquer that mountain \nroad somehow, the way forward after that \nshould be flat and fairly easygoing.<PAGE>At least according to my map.'
273825:'There will surely be greater trials \nto face before I can finally discover \nmy roots as a Krityan.<PAGE>Even if I were to cross the mountains, \nfor example, a perilous desert spreads \nout beyond its far side.'
273826:'The only people likely to enter a desert \nare pioneering settlers, those with a severe \ncase of wanderlust, and the insane.'
273828:'If all goes well, I may end up \nbeing able to work for the Duce \ndirectly in some capacity.'
273829:'Hoh hoh hoh.<PAGE>What the... *Pant* \nHeck are you... *Wheeze* \nDoing...?'
273830:'Whooee. I'd like to \nenter the tournament \none of these days.<PAGE>I'm right in the middle of my training regimen. \nYou've gotta toughen yourself up beforehand, see?'
273831:'Hoh hoh hoh... *Gasp, wheeze...* \nI've been doing this \nsame run so much... *Pant* \nThat it's boring me \nto tears... Wonder \nwhat I should do...'
273832:'Phew. Suppose I could head out of town... \nOn second thought... I don't really \nwant to tangle with the monsters...'
273833:'Hoh hoh hoh... *Huff, \npuff...* Those Knights \nare such a bother... \n*Gasp* Come on, stop \nlooking over here... I-it's \nembarrassing...'
273834:'...What do they need the \nKnights for, anyway? They've \ngot us, don't they...?'
273836:'Phew. Cados is under blockade, not \nto mention any travel by boat. And \nthe mountain road is out to boot.<PAGE>Nordopolica's been sealed \noff tighter than a clam...'
273837:'Don don don dooooon!! Nooo... Oh my \ngosh, man... The Don, I can't believe \nthe Don is dead and gone...!<PAGE>How will I...ever \nexpress my grief?!'
273838:'If only I'd \nbeen in Dahngrest...<PAGE>Don! Don, I never would've let you die! Don don don dooooon!!'
273839:'*Wheeze...* Just because the Don's \npassed away, *Pant* There's no excuse \nto go on pouting forever...<PAGE>*Gasp* Now I'm training in order to \nsend that blasted monster back where \nit came from. *...Huff, puff*'
273840:'Phew... Wonder how buff I need to \nbecome before I've got a real shot \nat taking down that monster...'
273841:'*Gasp, wheeze...* Oh, I'm nowhere near \nfinished... *Huff, puff* I've gotta keep \non running... For tomorrow's sake...'
273842:'Whew... The road to victory \nis long a long and perilous \none, huh...?'
273843:'This town is ruled autonomously \nby the guild, Palestralle. Their \nBoss is a woman known as Belius.<PAGE>The people here refer to \nher as the Duce though, \nas a show of respect.'
273844:'As wide as this world may be, \nPalestralle is the only guild \nthat commands an entire city.<PAGE>In the case of Dahngrest, the \npower's shared between the \nDon and the Union, you see.'
273845:'The coliseum building is divided into three \nparts. The commercial district, the residential \ndistrict, and the coliseum proper.<PAGE>To maintain public order, outsiders \nare strictly forbidden to \ntake up residence here.'
273846:'I've heard that if one takes up official residency in this town, \nit's possible to live in the coliseum's residential district.<PAGE>Not that there's any guarantee \nlife would be more interesting \nif you once you moved in.'
273847:'They say the new moon turns \nthe monsters used in the coliseum \nparticularly fierce.<PAGE>So, as a precaution, Palestralle keeps \nan extra-sharp watch on their monsters, \non nights before a new moon arrives.'
273848:'I happened to be in the coliseum right \nwhen the reverse barrier that contains \nthe monsters went down.<PAGE>It was frightening, to be sure, but it \nhappened when the moon ws full, so the \nmonsters we actually quite subdued.'
273850:'You can be sure the people of this town \nare allowing the Knights to maintain \na presence here only grudgingly.'
273851:'It turns out that this provisional Duce, \nNatz, was the one actually managing \nPalestralle's business affairs.<PAGE>Accordingly, Belius' death hasn't \nposed any real hindrances to the \nguild's financial operations.'
273852:'Belius was a crucial support to the \nmorale of the town. The gravity of her \nloss should not be underestimated.'
273853:'The Knights are now without a Commandant, \nand what's more, their presence in each \nof the world's regions is faltering.<PAGE>It can't belong before control \nof Nordopolica is returned \nto Palestralle completely.'
273854:'Most likely something will need to be \ndone about this monster in the sky before \nsuch a thing can happen, though.'
273855:'See that headless statue, there? Apparently, \nthat's the patron goddess of warriors \nknown as the "benevolent mother."<PAGE>It was built nearly 800 years ago, \nbut the head was lost when a massive \nwave crashed against the town.'
273856:'Perhaps we too should pray before \nthe goddess. For our own well-being, \nand for the peace of this world.'
273857:'Hey, hey. Why is \nthat statue missing \nits face?<PAGE>Do you think maybe someone \ncame and took it?'
273858:'Is it supposed to be a woman? If they \nmade a statue of her, she must have \nbeen really pretty in real life.<PAGE>Aww. I wish somebody \nwould make a \nstatue of me.'
273859:'If you go out of the town and then go west, \nyou'll find a cave called the Cados.<PAGE>Everybody tells me it's super \ndangerous, and that I should \nnever go in there, though.'
273860:'When the wind blows through \nthe cave, it sounds just like \na whistle. Tweet, tweet.♪<PAGE>So it's also called the Cados \nWeasand, or something.'
273861:'The monsters got out at the coliseum. I guess \nthe reverse barrier isn't very strong.<PAGE>I hope they don't come \nand get me while I'm \nsleeping at night...'
273862:'The barrier around the town keeps monsters \nout, but the reverse barrier got its name because \nit's used to keep monsters inside it.'
273863:'Are these Knights \nour enemies, or \nour friends?<PAGE>They beat up the monsters, \nbut the grown-ups still \ndon't look very happy.'
273864:'I for one hope they're \nour friends.<PAGE>I mean, it would \nbe bad if we had this \nmany enemies.'
273865:'Miss Belius died, but I'd never \neven seen her before so \nI'm not sure how to feel.<PAGE>With the Knights here now, at least it'll \nbe peaceful for the time being, right?'
273866:'I also heard that a man \nnamed Don died, too.<PAGE>That's another person I'd \nnever seen before. I wonder \nwhere he was from?'
273869:'I heard the grown-ups say that the \nwhole world is in a big mess.<PAGE>But it's okay, because we'll \nall protect this town together. \nSo, I'm not afraid at all!'
273870:'Actually, the sky's so high up there, \nthat I can't really understand it.<PAGE>I wonder if that thing's \nreally dangerous.'
273871:'No moon in the sky... \nand the new moon...\nI get the feeling something’s going to happen.<PAGE>Though a premonition is nothing more than that, \nI’m sure feeling a mixture of anxiety and hope... '
273872:'It seems that Belius only \nmeets people at the new moon.<PAGE>Maybe I should \nvisit her later... '
273873:'I can't believe Duce Belius \nis dead... We were supposed to meet \nand have all manner of discussions.<PAGE>What an unfortunate twist of fate. \nIt was such a promising chance...'
273874:'This must be a message from the heavens: \n"Go and discover the origin of the Kritya"...'
273875:'I've had Lord Natz\narrange for me to work at \nthe coliseum's library.<PAGE>It's quite befitting a city of such history. \nThere are enough books there to \nsatisfy any Kritya's thirst for knowledge.'
273876:'I may even be able to \ndiscover our origins without \never having to go beyond those mountains.'
273877:'I once saw an image that \nlooked very much like that \nominous shadow in the sky.<PAGE>It must have been in one of the \nbooks in my parents' room, \nwhen I was very young...'
273878:'I get the feeling we \nKritya somehow have a very \ndeep connection to that beast in the sky...'
273879:'Long ago, the clans of old and \nthe human ruling class stood in partnership, \nunited through Kritya mediation.<PAGE>This may finally \nbe our time to stand up.'
273880:'Yes, I remember now. \nIt was in a passage in one \nof my parents' books.<PAGE>Be it lies or truth, \nI believe this is a duty \nassigned to our people.'
273881:'An accident has occurred within \nthe coliseum, and we are in the \nprocess of attending to it.<PAGE>It is our sworn duty to defend all towns \nthat lay within reach of the empire.'
273882,273884:'We will assure the safety \nof this town.'
273883:'It is possible that a number of the monsters \nhave escaped to the residential \ndistrict, and remain there still.<PAGE>We will stay until we can be completely \nsure of the town's safety.'
273885:'The people of this town seem \nto chafe at our presence, but \nwe must fulfill our duty.<PAGE>If they choose not to accept us, well \nthat is ultimately not our concern.'
273886:'No matter how the townspeople may \nfeel, we must stand by our posts \nuntil our work here is finished.'
273887:'We have our duties to perform. Whatever \nmay be happening in the sky can \nnot sway us from that task.'
273888:'If anything should threaten the order \nof this town, we must apply the full \nmeasure of our force against it.'
273890:'The other day, an old \nwoman left some steamed \nbuns with us.<PAGE>They were piping-hot and actually \nquite delicious...'
273891:'Thankfully, not many people are out and about at \nnight... At least then I can be free from the scorn \ntheir eyes show whenever they look at us...<PAGE>I can understand that they weren't \noverjoyed to see us, but...this \nhurts a little...'
273892:'We came here for what we understood \nto be the cause of good...'
273893:'A citizen threw a rock at \nme... Then he dared me to \ntry and arrest him...<PAGE>I wish it were that \nsimple for me, you \nknow, emotionally.'
273894:'Maybe I'm just not cut out \nto be a Knight after all.<PAGE>It might be time to start looking for another job...'
273895:'Captain Schwann is far too busy... \n*Mumble, mumble...* So the Lieutenant \ndoes his job... Oh...<PAGE>Zzz... Sir \nLeblanc...'
273896:'Any suspicious behavior from you... \n*Mumble, mumble...* And I'll take\nyou into custody...'
273897:'We've come here... *Mumble, mumble...* \nto assist the \n<STR>(FRE) Brigade... <PAGE>Zzz... Ooh, you're \nunder arrest...'
273898:'As long as we d-d-do our best... \n*Mumble, mumble...* Everyone \nwill be happy...'
273899,273905,273908,273911,273914,273917:'Late night visitors, I see.\nWelcome to Nordopolica's\nhotel facility.<PAGE>The cost is 500 Gald per night. \nWill you be staying with us?'
273901:'Thank you very much.<PAGE>Please enjoy your stay.'
273902:'A few days ago, \na few suspicious looking \ncharacters arrived at the inn.<PAGE>Those guys are knights, weren’t they? \nThey just left, \nwearing knight’s armor.'
273903:'Why have they come \nto this town?<PAGE>They were standing around town \nwearing normal clothes, they \ntricked us the swine!'
273904:'If the guys that stayed \nhere were knights, I should \nhave set up a little tourist-trap...'
273907,273910,273913,273916,273919:'Thank you very much.\nHope to see you again.'
273920,273923,273926,273929,273932,273935,273938:'Welcome to you. This shop is directly \naffiliated with Fortune's Market.<PAGE>Whether you're on a long journey, or just \na trip to the coliseum, we have the items \nto satisfy all your shopping needs!'
273941,273950,273959:'Hey, got any need for items? I've been \napproved by Fortune's Market itself. \nLet me know what you I can get you.'
273943,273946,273949,273952,273955,273958,273961:'Appreciate it, pal. \nCome back anytime.'
273944,273953:'Hey there, how about taking a \nlook? My shop's been approved \nby Fortune's Market itself.<PAGE>Thanks, bud. Stop \nby anytime.'
273947,273956:'We welcome browsers, too. My shop's been \napproved by Fortune's Market itself. \nYou go ahead and look all you like.<PAGE>Always a pleasure. \nCome back anytime.'
273962,273965,273968,273971,273974,273977,273980:'Welcome! We're the coliseum city's \nofficial store. You'll find everything \nyou need right here.'
273964,273967,273970,273973,273976,273979,273982:'We hope you'll come \nsee us again.'
273984:'The empire claims a history of roughly eight \ncenturies, but this town far exceeds that, \nhaving been founded some 1200 years ago.<PAGE>And to think that it all began with the \nstone slabs of the original coliseum.'
273985:'If you head from here for twenty or thirty kilometers \nin a westerly direction,you will hit a high and steep mountain range \nknown to us as the Mother Cados mountains.<PAGE>It's quite a meaningful name, \nbut it's only used by \nthis town's folk.'
273986:'Once you have passed the Mother Cados mountains, \nyou will hit the Sands of Kogorh, but you’re going to need some serious \npreparations before getting over those mountains!'
273987:'The Knights went rushing into \nthe coliseum for some reason...<PAGE>It would seem that something \nquite serious is happening.'
273988:'This city is truly fascinating...as much for its historical value as it \nis for being the gathering place of so many rough-and-tumble types.<PAGE>It seems like such a dichotomy, but \nthe two unite here in Nordopolica.'
273991:'It is for the best that the \nKnights are here to maintain \norder in the town.<PAGE>I'm not certain I feel the same way \nabout that battleship, though.'
273993:'Duce Belius has passed away... \nNow is the time for mourning.<PAGE>The death of a person is a great loss. \nIt is also a rite of passage for \nthose of us who remain behind.'
273994:'Death is one thing we \ncannot simply pretend \nhas not occurred.<PAGE>The coming weeks will be a time \nof trial for this town.'
273995,273996:'If that abomination were to attack this \ncity with its full strength, I doubt \nthe barrier would be of any help.<PAGE>Could this be the end \ntimes for humanity...?'
273997:'I've got a friend who moved to the \nresidential district here, and \nI've come to pay him a visit.<PAGE>For whatever reason though, \nthey won't let me in...'
273999:'Just when I thought I'd finally get to \nmeet my friend, I'm told the place is \nclosed to anyone who's not a resident.<PAGE>Do I seriously have to spend \nanother night in the inn?'
274000:'It's not like I'm made of money, or something. I've \ngotta save enough for my passage back to the capital. \nMan, nothing ever goes the way you think it will...'
274001:'Those Knights are surprisingly stingy. I \nasked one of them to loan me some Gald seeing \nas I'm broke, and he wouldn't do it.<PAGE>I thought the Knights were \nsupposed to help the people \nin their times of need.'
274002:'I mean, at least they could \nstand to give a guy enough \nfor a bite to eat.'
274003:'That battleship's gonna be headed back \nto the capital sooner or later, right?<PAGE>So why can't they give \nme a ride for at least \npart of the way, then?'
274004:'Those nights are surprisingly... Forget \nit, I'm done being surprised. They're \njust straight-up stingy.'
274005:'Here they're dealing with the death of Belius, \nand in Dahngrest it's the death of the Don.<PAGE>If I had to guess, I'd say that the \nCommandant of the Knights'll be the \nnext one to have his ticket punched.'
274006:'But if all three of them \nwere to die, who'd be \nleft to run this world?<PAGE>We'd really be in a bind \nif that happened...'
274007:'So the monster in the sky is \nhovering over Ilyccia, huh?<PAGE>Man, I'm so glad I came to this town... \nAnd that I was too broke to go home.'
274008:'It's not like I can just stay here forever, \nthough... My friend's being a real \njerk anyway. Tough breaks, huh...?'
274009:'First we get that freaky monster, and \nthen up comes this massive tower.<PAGE>Just what's the deal, here? Is \nthis world gonna be all right?'
274010:'Man, my head feels like it's full of rocks. \nI can't keep up with all this stuff.'
274011:'This is the world's one and only coliseum. \nThere's plenty of folks who come from far \nand wide just to catch a glimpse of it.<PAGE>You look like you've come a pretty long way yourselves. \n'Course anybody could tell that, seein' as \nyou're lookin' a bit on the scruffy side.'
274013:'Why are there \nKnights in this town?<PAGE>If we leave it as it is, the discipline\nwe worked hard to build in the\ncoliseum will collapse!'
274015:'In this town, we've worked things out so that \nthe guild Palestralle stands on equal footing \nwith the regular folks that live here.<PAGE>We're not into that absolute government \nstuff they force on people \nin the imperial capital.'
274023:'On a night with no moon, \nit’s darker than usual, \nmakes me feel uneasy.<PAGE>The monsters are getting restless, \nand I’m getting more and \nmore uneasy... '
274024:'This may be an uneasy night, \nbut this town should be defended \nby the Guildsmen of Palestralle.<PAGE>We don’t need \nthe Knight’s help.'
274027:'Those schemin' Knights. They say they're \nhere to provide security, but I know \nit's their plan to take over.<PAGE>Belius would never stand \nfor such tyranny...'
274028:'But Belius has gone \nand left us behind...'
274029,274033:'I'm a member of Palestralle, the \nguild that governs this city.<PAGE>I'm on patrol tonight, \nas usual.'
274030,274034:'If I spot anyone actin' \nfishy, I sentence them to \na swift butt kicking.'
274031:'What’s that? \nSome Knights are heading \nto the coliseum?<PAGE>Lurking like thieves in the night! \nHiding here all along!'
274032:'Huh? It's... It's not a guy? \nIt's a place? Like a city? <PAGE>So bring 'em all on! All of \nus in Palestralle will rip \nevery last one of 'em apart'
274035:'What’s that? \nSome Knights are heading \nto the coliseum?<PAGE>They must have \nsnuck in under the \ncover of darkness!'
274036:'What happened?\nWhat are all these\nknights doing here?!'
274037:'So they've finally gone and done \nit, huh? Those Union dogs...<PAGE>That Don had been waitin' \nfor his chance to take out \nthe Duce all along!'
274038:'We can take on\nthese monsters if\nwe joined forces.'
274039:'Heh heh. That's right, man. \nI live in this town.<PAGE>Neat, huh? Pretty amazing, \nright? It's okay \nto be jealous.'
274040:'Someday, I'm gonna be as strong \nas that guy Kratos, and I'll \nbe a hero of the tournaments.<PAGE>Not even you guys could \nbeat Kratos. He's the \ntoughest in the world!'
274041:'Yeah! Woo hoo! The champion \nof the coliseum is \ntotally awesome!<PAGE>I heard his name's \n<STR>(FRE)! Knights \nare so cool!'
274042:'If I become a Knight, will \nI get that strong and be able \nto win that many fights?'
274043:'Those Knights were so cool. They took down all \nthe monsters in the coliseum, just like that.<PAGE>That horn's pretty \nsweet, too.♪'
274044:'You never can be too sure about people \nwho don't have horns, I always say.'
274045:'Hey, hey, are the Knights bad \nguys, or something? That's \nwhat the grown-ups said.<PAGE>It's too bad that the cool-looking \nguys have to be the bad ones.'
274046:'I guess it's okay to have cool-looking \nvillains too, though.'
274047:'The town's quieted down thanks \nto the work the Knights did.<PAGE>That settles it, they're cool in my book. \n...Woops... If my mom hears me say \nthat, she'll box my ears for sure.'
274048:'I guess not everyone's as big a fan \nof the Knights as I am, huh? I guess \nthat's 'cause they're bad guys.'
274049,274051:'Forget being a hero of the coliseum, \nI'm gonna be a hero of the Knights!<PAGE>That sounds way more fun, anyway. \nWonder if Mom will let me.'
274050,274052:'I've gotta start saving money \nso I can go to the capital...<PAGE>Oh wait, I forgot \nI've gotta grow \nup first...'
274053:'Some tournaments pit humans against other \nhumans, while others have humans squaring \noff against monster opponents.<PAGE>There are many monsters \nkept here at the coliseum \nfor that purpose.'
274054:'Monsters can be brought within \nthe barrier if a special formula \nis applied to their bodies.<PAGE>Take a close look at the monsters \nin the coliseum and you'll see tattoos \netched into their hides.'
274055:'Some nut job smashed the blastia \nthat keeps the monsters locked \nup. Who the hell would \ndo a thing like that?'
274056:'They busted up all the reverse \nbarriers like nothing.<PAGE>That's not the kind of power \nyou take lightly...'
274057:'This town's always enjoyed independence under Palestralle. \nThe guild has always made sure peace is maintained here.<PAGE>We'll be lucky if things don't get out \nof control with all these Knights around, \nbut I wouldn't hold your breath.'
274058:'Palestralle's managed things \njust fine in Nordopolica \non its own until now.<PAGE>If the empire tries to force their \nway of doing things on the people \nhere, I'd get ready for fireworks.'
274059:'Are those bloody Knights not gonna \nbe happy 'til they've taken \ntotal control of the city?<PAGE>They've got battleships on the water, \nand Knights all over the streets... \nWhat'll become of the coliseum?'
274060:'If the coliseum falls into the hands \nof the empire, it's going to get real \nboring around here, real fast.<PAGE>This town'll get so tied up in rules and red \ntape, it's days'll be all but numbered.'
274061:'The Knights and Palestralle were \nbutting heads over who'd handle \nsecurity around the coliseum.<PAGE>We ended up settling it over a game of \nrock, paper, scissors, I kid you not.'
274062:'We ended up losing, so we had to give the \njob to the Knights. Man, playing rock, \npaper, scissors sure was fun, though...<PAGE>I know it's \njust a game, \nbut still...'

274344:'If you proceed east from the exit \nover there you'll reach Dahngrest.<PAGE>If you leave town at night, \nyou'll be sorry.'

274346:'If you proceed east from the exit \nover there you'll reach Dahngrest.<PAGE>The night is... \nit's so terrible I can speak no more.'
274347,274348,274349,274350:'Do not speak.'
274351:'I've got a weak stomach...'
274352,274354,274356,274358:'You've gotta let me in there...'
274353:'My stomach's killing me...<PAGE>Wonder if it was that banana \nI found earlier today.'
274355:'I'd sell my soul to \nthe devil himself...<PAGE>If he agreed to free me \nfrom this suffering... '
274357:'Ohhh, the pain...<PAGE>Hey, I'm starting to feel a bit better!'
274359:'Oh, you were\nbrought here from upstairs too.<PAGE>At this hour,\nall the workers are\nat the construction site.'
274362:'Isn't there anything we can do to \nimprove the lives of the needy?<PAGE>I want to do my part to \nhelp the town, too.'
274363:'If we assume that fairness has \na place in this world...<PAGE>Shouldn't we start by making things \nfair between men and women?'
274364:'Is it right for women to be treated \nunfairly, just because they're women?'
274365:'Why should anyone care if some women \nare manly, and some men are girly?'
274366:'In an ideal society, we'd celebrate \nour diversity, instead of worrying about \nhow men and women should behave.'
274367:'Progress happens when we choose the best \nchoice out of the many available to us.<PAGE>Clinging stubbornly to only one set of values \ncan never be a good thing, in the end. '
274368:'My life's gonna be a whole \nnew set of choices.<PAGE>And just you watch, somebody will choose me!'
274369:'Mom and Dad have started coming \nhome every night, again.'
274370:'It's almost time for us to eat dinner together.'
274371:'I remember something my dad said...<PAGE>If all people are not happy, \nthen none of us can be happy.'
274372:'Are you happy?'
274373:'My parents tell me I have to go \nto bed, but I'm not even tired...'
274374:'It's no fair! Mom and Dad are still awake.'
274375:'Hey, what are "little white lies?"'
274376:'Dad said to stop telling them, but...'
274377:'After Sir <STR>(FRE)'s arrival, \nshelters were built for \npeople who have no homes.<PAGE>Bless him. Bless his heart.'
274378:'After Sir <STR>(FRE)'s arrival, \nall the villains were \nsent to jail.<PAGE>Bless him. Bless his heart...'
274379:'I bought blankets for some of the children.<PAGE>No one should have to spend \nthe night shivering.'
274380:'We must make sure the children grow \nup holding onto their dreams.'
274381:'We grown-ups cannot simply lie to \nthem because we are too busy.'
274382:'What would the world come to if \nchildren grew up not thinking \nthat telling lies is wrong?'
274383:'Trying to determine the authenticity \nof rumors is an exercise in futility.'
274384:'We're having such a nice chat here, I'll \nstop putting such a damper on the mood.'
274385:'At last, my work for the day is done.'
274386:'I've been wondering, lately.<PAGE>Which would be the easier \nway to die, by over work, \nor starvation...?'
274387:'There's no equality among people, and no fairness, either.<PAGE>This town's taught me that.'
274388:'All we can hope to do is \neach worry and toil away \nat our own lots in life.'
274389:'During the day, these children are little hell-raisers.<PAGE>But at night, their sleeping faces make \nthem look just like little angels.'
274390:'Their peaceful faces ease \nthe pain of a day's work.'
274391:'Just why is it that so many \nof the rules we live by seem \nto contradict each other?'
274392:'Some of life's rules we \nmust obey, though we know \nthem to be faulty...<PAGE>Teaching such things to \nchildren is no easy task.'
274393:'A small child's words can \nstab you in the heart. <PAGE>Probably because \nadults think it without \nbeing able to say it.'
274394:'Perhaps it's that their words are the things \nwe think, but would never dare to say.'
274395:'What sort of ingredients do you like to put in your curry?'
274396:'I mean, potatoes and carrots are pretty \nmuch no-brainers to start with.'
274397:'Too hard, and it gets on your nerves. Too \nsoft, and it leaves you wanting more.<PAGE>People are like pasta. Always go for the al dente!'
274398:'We should live our lives like we cook pasta!'
274399:'The rainy season makes everything so sticky, I just can't stand it.<PAGE>But we've got to have rain. Otherwise \nthe crops wouldn't grow.'
274400:'People are the same way...<PAGE>We've all had times when the blues just won't \nlet up, like during the rainy season.'
274401:'Leave the protection of the town to the Knights, and \nleave the protection of the home to the wives!<PAGE>It doesn't take a sword to keep the peace \nin a house, just a few killer recipes!'
274402:'Food can be a poison...\nEven a good wife has a\nlittle poison in her.'
274404:'......<PAGE>I wonder where the nobles' mansions are?'
274405:'There are plenty of apathetic \npeople in this town.<PAGE>I don't think they started \nout that way, though.'
274406:'I wonder if there's a job they could do that \nwould make them feel more worthwhile.'
274407:'People can't do without happiness!<PAGE>No matter how lethargic a person might be, \nif they can figure out what makes them happy, \nthey'll have a reason to keep busy.'
274408:'What about a cafe where the employees \nare prickly to customers even \nthough they like them? <PAGE>What do you think?'
274409:'I'm so happy the maid \ncafe is doing so well. <PAGE>But I've gotten so wrapped \nup, I've forgotten to get \na room for the night...'
274410:'Where is the cafe? <PAGE>It's deep into the city. \nBut it's members only! \nYou'll never get in!'
274411:'Are you feeling tired?<PAGE>Why not let me help you relax a bit?'
274412:'I hope to further develop the culture \nof hospitality in the future.'
274413:'There's nothin' finer than that first \ndrink after a job well done.'
274414:'You'd better not try and tell me I wasn't workin'!'
274415:'It's nothin' but a rotten lie that \ndrinkin' makes people go bad!'
274416:'Drinks only let's us see that \npeople are bad to begin with.'
274417:'Drinkin', fightin', and buyin' stuff. A man's world revolves around these things.'
274418:'How could a fella hope to enjoy life \nwithout a healthy dose of all three?'
274419:'You mustn't drink to \nescape from reality.<PAGE>Best to sit the bottle on the shelf if you get to feelin' that way.'
274420:'No, we drink to sing high \nthe praises of life!<PAGE>Three cheers to my life and yours!'
274421:'It's because of Sir <STR>(FRE) \nthat I have a roof over \nmy head when I sleep.<PAGE>It makes me so happy. '
274422:'I used to sleep on a board I put \ndown under the eaves of a shop...'
274423:'Now I get to sleep in \na toasty warm bed.<PAGE>It's so nice.'
274424:'I've never had my own big \nfluffy blanket before...'
274425:'I got to eat an apple-mango \nparfait for desert!<PAGE>It was sooo good.'
274426:'Maybe I can have a strawberry \ncream-tart next time.'
274427:'I started thinking that being happy meant \ngetting to have whatever you want.'
274428:'But that's not it at all...<PAGE>It's the moments you're working your \nhardest to get something you want. \nThat's where happiness is.'
274429:'I'm trying to reason out what \nliving a good life involves.<PAGE>What do you think?'
274430:'Living a good life, to me, is an end result.<PAGE>So then, how should we act in \norder to produce this result?'
274431:'The one who laughs at 1Gald will \nend up crying about 1Gald. <PAGE>A small waste can \ncause big problems.'
274432:'No matter how little a person may have, \nsaving money a bit at a time is crucial.'
274433:'No matter how much money \nI save, I know it won't help \nagainst the monsters. <PAGE>Even so, I keep \non saving.'
274434:'1 Gald today becomes 2 Gald tomorrow, and 4 Gald \nthe day after that... And so on and so forth...<PAGE>How many Gald do \nyou think that is \nafter a month?'
274435:'My life has become bountiful.<PAGE>But we must never grow complacent.'
274436:'Money and fire are no different.<PAGE>Used carefully they can be quite handy. Put \nthem to indiscriminate use though, and everything \nyou love might go up in smoke.'
274437:'This is the weapons depot.<PAGE>No one may enter without \npermission.'
274438:'Whenever night rolls around, I can't \nhelp wondering to myself..<PAGE> Is this town actually what \nwe're here to defend...?'
274439:'When weapons are used, people die. \nBut if accept that weapons are necessary \nto keep the peace, then...<PAGE>It's a rather glaring contradiction.'
274440:'Do you think an ideal world \nwould be free of weapons?'
274441:'When two sides come to quarrel, each \nmust strive to cool the heat of their \nemotions, first and foremost.<PAGE>Following this, each party should \neat their fill, and reopen negotiations \non a full stomach.'
274442:'I guess they found a mistake \nI made. Oh, a demotion... <PAGE>My wife, my daughter, \nforgive this pitiful man...'
274443:'All of my colleagues served \n<STR>(FRE) and got promoted, but \nI'm still stuck here... <PAGE>Why, oh, why...?'
274444:'It is a good thing to be able to sleep \naway the night without worry...'
274445:'You'll be heading to the woods\noutside Torim Harbor from here.<PAGE>It gets dark and you can\nget yourself lost easily,\nso be careful.'
274446:'You've got to be pretty brave\nto be going outside the barrier.\nYou aren't even knights.'
274447:'You're going outside town?\nI say you forget about it...<PAGE>It's safer to stay inside\nthe barrier. Trust me.'
274448:'This is a good workplace. <PAGE>I feel sorry for my colleagues \nworking dangerous missions \noutside of the barrier.'
274449:'If you exit here, you'll be \nheading towards Torim Harbor. <PAGE>You'll have to enter Dahngrest \nfrom the front entrance.'
274450:'But is it not wiser to wait in patience...?<PAGE>To wait for night's \neventual brightening?'
274451:'You've got a forest teeming with \nmonsters, so be careful. <PAGE>...No, really, be careful. If \nyou're worried, it's best if you \nstayed inside the barrier.'
274452:'The survival of the people no longer depends \non their ability to steal what food they can.'
274453:'It's a Knight's desire to die \nhelping someone in need! <PAGE>If you have no purpose, \nit's better to rust \nand whither away!'
274454:'To be brought low standing in the service \nof others is a Knight's great ambition.<PAGE>No joy can exceed it!'
274455:'Incompetent Knights \nblame their weakness \non their swords. <PAGE>The idiots. They're \nthe weak ones!'
274456:'The true Knight reflects upon and \nlearns from his failed efforts.'
274457:'Living each day as though it may be your \nlast, but seeking always to better yourself \nas though you will live an eternity.<PAGE>This is the way of life of a Knight.'
274458:'A knight should be prepared to\ngive his life for the citizens!'
274459:'Swinging our swords to protect \nthe country, we bloody our \nhands and become sinners. <PAGE>But it is because of this \nsacrifice that we Knights \natone for our sins!'
274460:'For only in this can there be salvation \nfrom the blood-stained lives we \nwho don the armor must lead.'
274461:'The gap between the haves and the have-nots \nis not likely to be filled quickly, even though \nCumore is no longer in the picture.'
274462:'But if we listen with care to the voices \nof the less-fortunate, and tend to \ntheir concerns one at a time...<PAGE>A day will surely come when this town \nwill rise to its full potential.'
274463:'Of the many proud achievements the \nKnights can claim, not a one was \naccomplished by our power alone.<PAGE>The Knights could not hope to function without \nthe combined support of all the people.'
274464:'It is this system of support, that allows \nus to pour our every effort into \nwhatever we may struggle against.'
274465:'If most people could manage to think \nrationally and control their emotions, \nmost conflicts could be avoided. <PAGE>If all people could do these \nthings, conflicts would \ncease to exist entirely.'
274466:'If most people could manage to think \nrationally and control their emotions, \nmost conflicts could be avoided.<PAGE>If all people could do these \nthings, conflicts would \ncease to exist entirely.'
274467:'Can you think of anything equal in weight \nand importance to the life of a person?<PAGE>Are we Knights right to risk our lives \nfor glory, and the praise of others?'
274468:'As far as I've been able to learn, \nthere is nothing in this world quite \nso precious as human life.<PAGE>No matter how important something \nmay seem, all things pale in comparison \nbefore the sanctity of life.'
274470,274472,274474,274476:'Go right ahead!'
274477:'We will protect the night \ncity because Captain \nFlynn has come! <PAGE>Bring it on! We can \ntake on any criminal!'
274478:'The freedom these people gained when \nCumore fell from power... In the \nend, it doesn't amount to much.'
274479:'The Knights do what must be done.<PAGE>We cannot allow personal misgivings, obstacles, \ndangers, or pressures to stand in the way.'
274480:'This is the underlying principal of knighthood.'
274481:'The guilds and the Empire \nare enemies. The Union \ncontrols the guilds... <PAGE>It is about time that \npeople free themselves \nfrom these rules.'
274482:'The only embarrassment is in refusing to \nacknowledge our own weaknesses, or in not \nattempting to understand those of others.'
274483:'If there is one thing the history \nbooks teach us, it is that wars \nare contests between powers.<PAGE>In such struggles, the ones who \nsuffer most are those furthest \nfrom the sources of power.'
274484:'No matter how we may wish to see it, make no mistake, \nthe sword of a Knight is an implement of war...<PAGE>And a mind filled with thoughts of justice is \nindispensable for it to be put to proper use.'
274485:'They say people \nlive to eat.<PAGE>Well, a Knight lives \nto shed blood \nfor the people.'
274486:'Even if the food be plain, it \nis better than none at all.'
274487:'The birth of each person holds in \nit an important meaning, I am sure.<PAGE>However, if each person does not come to this realization \non their own, such meaning will be lost.'
274488:'Each person must come to understand \nthe meaning of their own existence.<PAGE>If they do, they will find the bravery \nto endure hardship, and the hope of \na new day will rise within them.'
274489:'My job does not end \nwhen the sun sets. <PAGE>In fact, nighttime is when a \nKnight's real duty begins.'
274490:'After all, you will never be \nanything more or less than yourself, \nbe it day or night...'
274491:'The country is in danger. \nNow is the time that we \nKnights can truly shine. <PAGE>The lay people's place is behind \nus, trembling in fear!'
274492:'Our youth flies by before we can understand \ntime's true worth, and after reaching adulthood, \nwe are kept endlessly busy...<PAGE>In our old age, the majority of our time is \nspent suffering the discomfort of illness.'
274493:'All people are more or less \nthe same, at heart.<PAGE>Is it not that politics are really to blame for creating \nthe differences that separate one person from the next?'
274494:'Do not the attitudes \nof those above...<PAGE>Determine whether those below \nare seen as evil or as good?'
274495:'There is no harm in stumbling \nwhen we fail at something.<PAGE>There is value even in this, so long as we examine \nthe reasons why, and learn from our mistakes.'
274496:'If we become able to see our failures as valuable \nexperiences and useful lessons, success \nwill be waiting just around the corner.'
274497:'We shouldn't waste time worrying whether \nevery choice we make is right.<PAGE>No one but the \ngods can be right \nall the time.'
274498:'What's important is to make up our minds quickly, \nand then to act upon our decisions.<PAGE>If we do, though we may be mistaken, \nwe will often have the time \nto repair our wrongs.'
274499:'Before criticizing or casting blame \non others, try to find something \nin them worthy of praise.<PAGE>In so doing, you will remove \nmuch of the sting of scorn \nfrom your words.'
274500:'It won't do to raise your voice, no matter how \nangered you may sometimes become. Instead, \nkeep your cool by counting slowly up to 10.<PAGE>If your anger remains unabated, count to \n100. Still seething? Make it a thousand.'
274501:'According to my research, \nthis town has a large \nnumber of workers.<PAGE>It just goes to show that \nregardless of your class, \npeople have to work.'
274502:'The power to change the world reveals itself \nonly at times of great despair...<PAGE>And comes to those who do not \nfalter in their efforts.'
274503:'People are worrisome creatures...<PAGE>Such caution can often be helpful.'
274504:'However, we cannot let it hold us back.<PAGE>We must remember to move forward, worrying as we go.'
274505:'Status and pedigree, money, and profession... \nSuch things are unnecessary when \nit comes to making people happy.<PAGE>It might be said, rather, that they impede happiness.'
274506:'Happiness exists only within \nthe hearts of people.<PAGE>Those who draw contentment from life though they live \nin cramped quarters, are poorly fed, and dress only \nin rags, can be said to truly know happiness.'
274507:'Those who practice what they preach \nsleep soundly at night...<PAGE>Those who cannot manage this, sleep restlessly \nand are haunted by their dreams...'
274508:'There's no reason to despair simply because \nyou have a nightmare or two, however.<PAGE>The very act of our birth into this world, in a sense, \nis the beginning of a nightmare, after all... '
274509:'If we wait in line for hand-outs, we \ncan receive some food at no cost.'
274510:'Being able to eat without working for it...<PAGE>It's every man's dream!'
274511:'We all want life to be a little easier, \nand if that means getting a free-lunch, \nwell then, why not?'
274512:'Water can't help but run down hill... \nYou can't get more natural than that.'
274513:'Slackers and hard workers aren't all that \ndifferent when you get down to it.<PAGE>No matter who you are, you're gonna spend \nabout half your life sleeping, right?'
274514:'Apparently, if you're somebody who wastes all \nyour time working, they call you "diligent."'
274515:'What is it that \nI must do? <PAGE>It is my job to \nthink about that.'
274516:'I get a feeling it's my calling to spend \nmy time trying to figure that out.'
274517:'The night is my friend... \nAnd despair is my guide...'
274518:'This town defines the very absence \nof hopes and dreams.'
274519:'Someone once told me, "Life is nothing \nbut suffering and fear!"<PAGE>And now that very time is at hand!'
274520:'We're all destined to writhe \nin horror as we die.'
274521:'People spend their lives writhing and \nsquirming, trying to outrun destiny...<PAGE>And what is the result...? It always \ncatches up to them, of course.'
274522:'If we turn and face our fate, rather than escaping from \nit, it will be our destiny that is forced to flee.'
274523:'To be a Knight is to live in honor. We talk \nof honor as if it were some grand idea.<PAGE>Do you have any idea how boring living \na life of honor really is...?'
274524:'Join the Knights and you'll find out soon enough.'
274525:'Each person walks to the beat of a different drummer.<PAGE>All you can do is walk your own walk, \nbut it's bound to give you your \nown unique scenery as you go.'
274526:'Take the nobles, for example, sitting so proudly in their \npalanquins, as they're ferried about by the commoners...<PAGE>Because of their position they \nsit above everyone else, and have \na better view than all of us.'
274527:'A Knight's job does not consist of parading \naround in a suit of shiny armor.<PAGE>Our true work is to pick up the refuse \nthat no one else will touch, in a way.'
274528:'There is plenty of garbage left in this town, under \nthe guise of discrimination and injustice.'
274529:'Words are truly mysterious \nthings.<PAGE>They can instill in people the \nwill to live, and they can also \ntear such a hope to pieces.'
274530:'Maybe it's a prerequisite for officials \nto be talented wordsmiths.'
274531:'The stupid blastia, trying \nto defy humans... <PAGE>If it weren't related to \nthe barrier, I would smash \nit into pieces...'
274532:'They go on shining, never \nmoving, but reveal to \nus all the way forward.'
274533:'The commoners should be made \nto stand watch at night... <PAGE>All of this because we're \nshort a few men.'
274534:'It's nothing to puzzle too hard over.<PAGE>The important thing is \nto be true to yourself.'
274535:'It's because of the Cumore Brigade \nand our resource management that \nthis town is developing! <PAGE>The commoners should accept their \nplace under our control!'
274536:'If you're not to keen on dying, I'd \nrecommend going with giving up.'
274537:'<STR>(FRE)...\n<STR>(FRE) is amazing...\nI knew he'd do it...<PAGE>*Gasp*\n...I wasn't sleeping!'
274538:'Save yourself the trouble, and \nstop fighting the inevitable!'
274539:'<STR>(FRE)...\nI'll always... stand by...\n...stand by you...<PAGE>*Gasp* ...Oh, <STR>(FRE)...\nYou're not him...'
274540:'It's best to do whatever work you can get \nyour hands on while you're still young...'
274541:'<STR>(FRE)... I love you...\nLook at me...\nFor the rest of my life, I'll...<PAGE>*Gasp*\n...Was I saying something\nin my sleep?'
274542:'There's something I've learned in being attacked by monsters.<PAGE>If you're planning on doing something, there's \nno time like the present for getting it done...'
274543:'<STR>(FRE)...\nI rushed here...\nto save you...<PAGE>*Gasp*... Oh, no, I drooled...'
274544:'I want to rush to \nSir Flynn's side...<PAGE>I-I didn't mean \nit like that..!'
274545:'It's a rare thing indeed when the toils \nof today pay off as tomorrow's results.<PAGE>The wear and tear of each passing day always \nseems to show up at year's end, though...'
274546:'We tend to give up if we don't get \nthe results we want right away.<PAGE>And that's a real tragedy, in a manner of speaking.'
274547:'Life's tragedy begins the moment \nwe are born into this world.<PAGE>However, the comedy of life \nalso begins with our birth.'
274548:'Intrinsically, darkness is the \nbreeding ground of evil. This is \nthe time we should be working. <PAGE>I don't know why, but it's \nprobably by tradition that \nless people work at night.'
274549:'Humans need god to ensure \ntheir continued freedom.<PAGE>However, god depends on the people \nfor his very existence.'
274550:'Surely, this is one of the \ngreat paradoxes of our age.'
274551:'There is no day or night in times \nof urgency. Our colleagues are \nworking hard around the world. <PAGE>We cannot afford to \nlose ground here.'
274552:'It would be fair to say that this "god," \nas we call him, has soaked the pages \nof human history with blood.'
274553:'Sorry.\nWe're still preparing.<PAGE>Come again.'
274555,274558,274561,274564,274567:'Will you be staying? \nThat will be 350 Gald.'
274570:'At last, the day's come to a close.'
274571:'Ahh, I can finally rest...'
274572:'Field manuals come in handy \nduring peacetime...<PAGE>But they're all but worthless in a real emergency!'
274574:'If you want the truth, we were only able to \ndefend the town because luck was with us.<PAGE>But without the strict training we \nundergo on a daily basis, lady luck \nwould've never smiled on us today.'
274575:'This victorious outcome might've been a \ncoincidence, but I know we also have our \ndaily training to thank for our success.'
274576:'When our hard work is met with \nresults, we gain confidence.<PAGE>Even if our efforts don't pay off, \nwe benefit from the experience.'
274577:'Whether we accomplish our aims \nor not, putting forth the effort \nis winning half the battle.'
274578:'This town is rotten.\nWhat do you mean, what?<PAGE>Knights are bound by confidentiality.\nI cannot say...'

274580,274583,274586,274589,274592,274598,274601,274604:'Welcome. Looking for anything \nin particular?'
274582,274585,274588,274591,274594,274600,274603,274606:'Thanks very much. Please \ncome see us again.'
274597:'Thank you very much.\nPlease come again.'
274607:'Damn it, another guy \nwas supposed to take \nthe night shift... <PAGE>But he said he wasn't \nstaying up all night \nbecause he's a noble...!'
274608:'What does nobility \nhave to do with it?! <PAGE>...I was supposed \nto go on a date!'
274609:'Damn it, night \nshift again! <PAGE>Why do nobles \nget the right to be \nselfish all the time?!'
274610:'If you've got time for burbling out nonsense in your sleep, \nhow about putting your back into a little work!<PAGE>It will help you overcome this trial...'
274611:'There are a number of virtues we \nKnights must swear to live by.<PAGE>Did you know that?'
274612:'Justice, courage, trust, loyalty, love, courtesy, \nand wisdom. All seven are essential...<PAGE>But which would you value \nabove all others?'
274613:'If a person feels positive emotion, they should wear it \non their sleeve and cry it out for the world to hear.<PAGE>However, if we feel negative emotion, \nwe must bear it in silence.'
274614:'This is because whatever emotions we may feel \nare amplified when we give voice to them.'
274615:'*Sigh*...\nAnother night shift...<PAGE>I got past the anger\nand just completely gave up...'
274616:'The only thing I can say for certain is...<PAGE>He who breaks bread with me is my friend, and he who \nwould steal that which is mine, he is my enemy.'
274619,274622,274625,274628:'We wish you safe travels. \nTake care.'
274629:'It is wrong to assume that we'll be able to \nsee the results of a single day's training.<PAGE>Be that as it may, we must not fail \nto train each and every day.'
274630:'I'm a believer.<PAGE>This punishing training will pay off one day...'
274631:'Doubt not god's existence, nor \nseek evidence of his presence, \nfor god watches over us always.<PAGE>Give to god his due praise, but depend not upon his mercy...'
274632:'People are overly concerned with \nthe question of god's existence.<PAGE>Can we humans not be content \nto live without puzzling \nover such things?'
274633:'Digging deep into the question of \ngod's relationship with humanity...will \nlead us only to atheism.<PAGE>However, our ability to reach \nsuch a conclusion is proof, in \nitself, of god's existence.'
274634:'By the grace of Captain \n<STR>(FRE), the night shift \ngets a meal coupon. <PAGE>Hey, it's not bribery...'
274635:'Good evening. That's \nright, we're still open. \nRight this way.'
274637:'Thank you very much. \nHave a nice night.'
274638:'Good evening. Are you \nforgetting anything? Here \nnow, have a look.'
274640:'Thank you very much. We look forward \nto seeing you tomorrow.'
274641:'The coliseum, where the blood is washed away with \nmore blood... What a thrill! What I wouldn't \ngive to die upon the stone slabs myself...<PAGE>That is my dream. Pretty wild, \nhuh? At any rate, the coliseum's \nnowhere near here...'
274642:'Yormgen's lazy atmosphere \njust doesn't \nsuit me.<PAGE>Someday, I'll stand in the ring \nof the coliseum, and watch \nthe crimson blossoms bloom.'
274643:'So tell me, have you ever \nbeen to the coliseum?<PAGE>I've heard it has all the spectacle of \na feeding frenzy. What did you think?'
274644:'Huh? You participated at the \ncoliseum? I'm impressed you \nlived to tell the tale!<PAGE>It just goes to show that it's never safe \nto judge by appearances. Just what sort \nof crime did you commit, anyway?'
274645:'Out for a moonlit stroll like me?<PAGE>The sun-touched flowers have their charms, \nbut I like the way the moonbeams dance across \nthe flowers as well, almost like a dream.'
274646:'If only there were no monsters about, \nI could sleep at night free of worry...'
274647:'Make sure to watch your \nfooting in the dark.<PAGE>I would hate to see your \ndog slip a paw between the \nslats in the bridge.'
274648:'There are fewer holes \nif you walk the bridge \nalong its edges.'
274649:'That box... I feel as though \nI've seen it somewhere.<PAGE>Hmm, can't seem to recall \nwhere it was, though.'
274650:'If I say I can't remember, \nthen I can't remember. My, \nbut you're stubborn.<PAGE>I wouldn't expect you to remember \nwhat color shoes every person you \nmet yesterday was wearing, would I?'
274651:'The Sage was saying he was gonna make \nsome thingamajig out of some sort \nof stone. Amazing, isn't it?!<PAGE>I've plum forgotten what \nit was he made, though. \nI'm sure it was amazing.'
274652:'I said I couldn't remember what \nwas so amazing about it, didn't \nI? My, but you're stubborn.<PAGE>Can you tell me just what \nmakes the ocean so amazing? \nYou can't, can you?'
274653:'You've made quite \na journey here. <PAGE>But I'm afraid there's \nnothing special in \nthis village...'
274654:'So you were the ones they found \ncollapsed outside of town. That \nmust have been quite a shock.<PAGE>You're welcome to stay in the village as \nlong as it takes to regain your strength.'
274655:'Are you acquaintances \nof the Sage?<PAGE>Whatever could have brought \nyou all the way to our \nsleepy little village?'
274656:'Forgive us, but we don't have much to offer \nyou here in the way of sightseeing.<PAGE>Oh, have you been to see the northern \nmountain, yet? The scenery there \nis quite breathtaking.'
274657:'Are you not from these parts?<PAGE>There are so many flowers \ngrowing here, it's pretty, \ndon't you think?'
274658:'Everyone who visits here says what \na pretty town they think we have.'
274659:'Dee-zert? Desert? A desert \nfilled with sand? You mean \nyou came from a desert?<PAGE>Just where is there a desert?'
274660:'I've never seen a desert \nmyself. You must have come \nfrom really far away.'
274661:'You came from across the sea? That \nmust have been a tough trip.<PAGE>I'll bet you had to row a lot \nto get here. Huh? You didn't? \nBlas-cha? What's that?'
274662:'Huh? A-path-ee-ah? \nDoes it taste good?'
274663:'They say that the monsters will stop coming \nif we build a...barrier, I think it \nwas. Would that really keep us safe?<PAGE>If the Sage is saying it though, \nit must do what he says.'
274664:'If the Sage says it's so, then \nthere's no doubt about it.<PAGE>How could I ever question \nwhat he tells us?'
274665:'Even at night, we can't \nbe sure when the monsters \nwill stage an attack.<PAGE>That's why we keep watch over \nthe town in shifts like this.'
274666:'These monsters are capable of \nspeech, so hopefully they \nsleep at night, like we do.'
274667:'I know what's going on. The Sage is trying \nto ease our fears by saying that the clear \nciel crystal will keep out the monsters.<PAGE>Then he'll allow the monsters to attack \nwhen everyone is fast asleep... \nIt sounds possible doesn't it?'
274668:'But not on my watch. I'm not \nstanding here every night \nfor no reason, you know.<PAGE>Don't get me wrong. It's not that \nI'm questioning the Sage. Even still, \nbetter safe than sorry, right?'
274669:'......<PAGE>You're a stranger....'
274670:'I'm not supposed to...talk \nto strangers...'
274671:'......<PAGE>U-umm...'
274672:'Stop it... \nGo away...'
274673:'How about sharing a cup of coffee\nwhile we contemplate the moon?<PAGE>The moon's beauty and the aroma of the coffee \nmingle to wash clean the grime of a long day.'
274674:'And not just \nthe moon \nitself.<PAGE>Just look how the moonlight plays \nover the ripples on the water. '
274675:'Here's to your future.'
274676:'It sounds like they've got what they need to build this \nbarrier thing that's gonna keep the monsters out.<PAGE>Now Yormgen will be able to enjoy \nan everlasting peace... Now that's \nsomething to celebrate.'
274677:'Longchi...\nHow is he doing?<PAGE>He may be looking up\nat this very moon too...'
274678:'I want to see him...<PAGE>I'm sorry,\nhe's all I've talked about...'
274679:'What did you talk about\nwith Longchi?<PAGE>Maybe spinning tops...?\nHe's always loved\nspinning tops.'
274680:'I would appreciate\nany small thing you can\ntell me about when you saw him...'
274681:'With my father's sudden death, I took over \nhis management of the village, but nothing \nseems to go according to my plans...<PAGE>I'm not sure what I'd do if the \nSage weren't here to help me.'
274682:'If you're looking for the Sage, \nyou'll find him in the largest \nhouse in the village.'
274683:'Actually, everyone in the village \nhas lost some of their trust in \nme, on account of the Sage.'
274684:'It's a confusing feeling... I'm not sure \nif I should feel ashamed or relieved.'
274685:'I see you're awake.\nAre you feeling better now?<PAGE>I found you collapsed\nat the entrance to town.'
274686:'Oh, don't worry about the tab.<PAGE>I brought you here without your consent.'
274687:'Your friend\nwoke up a little while ago\nand left.'
274688:'Welcome back.\nIt'll be 50 Gald for one night.\nDo you wish to stay?'
274690:'Have a good day.'
274691:'Leaving so soon?<PAGE>You're quite welcome to \nstay as long as you like.'
274692:'You mustn't push yourselves to hard, \nor you may end up collapsing again.<PAGE>I'll have to start charging \nyou rent the next time \nit happens. Heh heh.'
274693:'You're all dressed in \nsuch strange garments.<PAGE>You don't see clothing like \nthat in these parts. Have \nyou come from far away?'
274694:'I wonder if the food \nyou're accustomed to \nis just as different.<PAGE>I'd love to hear about what sort of \ndishes you have where you're from, if \nit isn't too forward of me to ask.'
274695:'There are times, during the day, when \nI wish the temperature would just drop \nalready... But this is a bit too much.<PAGE>It's s-so c-c-cold... I'm \ngonna freeze to death...'
274696:'A while back, I got the wise idea \nof touching my armor with my bare \nhand, and my finger got stuck.<PAGE>What in the hell is the temperature right now, anyway...?'
274697:'I still can't stand the heat during \nthe day, but I've gotten so I can \ntake the cold at night pretty well.<PAGE>If it's cold, you just add a couple of layers. This armor's \nfit to bust with all the long underwear I've got on in here.'
274698:'Still, even if you become a \nmaster of desert living, it's \nhard to be happy out here.<PAGE>I'm bidding a fond farewell to this sand \ntrap as soon as I get the chance.'
274699:'I've been with the Knights for a year, my birthplace \nis the imperial capital, and the other day, \nI was assigned to the <STR>(FRE) Brigade!<PAGE>My hobby is cooking, my talent is interpretive \nsword dancing, and my favorite \ncolor is mulberry! I'm single!'
274700:'This has been my self-introduction! \nPlease forgive me \nfor being so late!<PAGE>I'd be pleased to answer any questions you \nmight have! The Captain has instructed \nus all to comply with you in every way!'
274701:'This region is a bit of a no-man's land, \nso it rarely sees any visitors.<PAGE>I wonder...what sort of shape \nthe other towns are in.'
274702:'Completing our duties in the desert is hard \nenough, but what's worse, we have a hard \ntime getting information out here.<PAGE>Thanks to the heat, the Knights stationed \nhere have no sense of urgency or motivation. \nEven my morale is beginning to waver...'
274703:'The guards work in shifts, but really, \nwhat's there to guard here? We've got \nnothing to do when we're off-duty.<PAGE>There was way more to keep me busy \nwhen it was my watch. Whoa, I'm more \nhard-working than I realized.'
274704:'The results of our investigation aren't very promising. The historical \nanalysis is moving right along, but we're coming up dry when \nit comes to anything having to do with the Commandant.<PAGE>It may be more trouble than \nits worth trying to find \nany clues in these ruins.'
274705:'We've been forgotten. That's it, he's forgotten \nus. Our Captain's gone and totally forgotten \nthat he left us here on guard duty!'
274706:'Captain <STR>(FRE) does skip a beat \nsometimes with things that \ndon't hold his interest.<PAGE>Do me a favor, and let the good Captain \nknow he's still got us out in the desert \non guard detail when you see him next.'
274707:'The heat makes running our investigation \ndifficult during the day, so we're \ncarrying on with it at night, too.<PAGE>Night isn't really the best time \nto dig things up 'cause you can't \nsee what you're doing. Oh well.'
274708:'And man, I had no idea it would \nbe this cold at night... We're \ngonna have to ask for a raise.'
274709:'Whoa! Watch where \nyou're stepping!<PAGE>It's dark, so take care where you walk. We can't \nhave you crunching some priceless artifact \nunderfoot simply 'cause you didn't see it.'
274710:'A monster in the sky? Yeah, \nI guess it does look like something's \nup there. I know.<PAGE>It's the job of the Knights to clean up monsters. \nIt's what they're there for, aint' it? All we're \nworried about is getting on with the excavation. '
274711:'Unfortunately, the investigation hasn't \nprogressed to the point where we can \ncommit to a theory of what occurred.<PAGE>We must press on if we hope to \ncomplete the task the Knights originally \nhired us to perform...'
274712:'What use would anyone have in coming to these ruins...? \nThere are no blastia buried here. What value could \na pile of rubble such as this possibly have?<PAGE>Hmm, it just doesn't \nadd up.'
274713:'We've uncovered an artifact of \ntremendous historical importance. \nWe've discovered writing!<PAGE>This gives us unmistakable clues \nabout the civilization of \nthose who once lived here!'
274714:'...The flowers...to the north...mountain... \nHmm, does this next \npart say "picnic?"<PAGE>A mountain to the north must mean Mt. \nTemza. But why is the word "picnic" \ncarved into something like this?'
274720:'Hasn't the fountain blastia \nbeen repaired yet? <PAGE>We're downhill from \nthe fountain here, \nso I'm worried about flooding.'
274722:'There's nothing to worry about. \nWe Knights will repel the monsters \nwhenever the blastia disappears. '
274723:'I am so excited! <PAGE>When a plan comes \ntogether, my fears go \nflyin' out the window.'
274724:'You came all the way from \nthe Tolbyccian continent and \nyou're sure you're all right?<PAGE>I see. \nGuess I've still got a lot \nto learn about travel.'
274725:'We Knights will \nguard Zaphias. <PAGE>Rest well. \nYou are safe.'
274726:'<STR>(FRE) will keep \nthe Knights together. <PAGE>He may be young, but \nI was watching him work. \nHe's perfect for the job. '
274727:'Commandant Alexei, \nCaptain Schwann, \nCaptain Cumore...<PAGE>They all left the Knights. \n<STR>(FRE)'s the only one left.'
274728:'When I was a kid, I \ndreamed of joining a \nmercenary guild. <PAGE>Wow, that really \ntakes me back...'
274729:'The most familiar \nguild here has got to \nbe Fortune's Market. <PAGE>They even have shops \nhere in the capital.'
274730:'People from the \nlower quarter are \nall good people. <PAGE>I have to work hard \nfor the citizens.'
274731:'These citizens took \nover as guards. \nI'm really thankful.'
274732:'The authority of the imperial \nfamily has collapsed. \nServes them right. '
274733:'Okay, who's going \nto bring peace to \nthis chaos? <PAGE>It probably won't be \nthe imperial family.'
274734:'I still don't know about going \noutside the barrier, though. \nIt's pretty scary...'
274735:'If you listen to that guy, \nyou'll want to just head \nstraight out on your trip.'
274736:'It's my first trip, so the \nstronger people I can \ntravel with, the better. <PAGE>I figure I should hire \na few mercenaries \njust to be safe.'
274737:'I wonder what mercenary \nguild would be good \nfor my job. <PAGE>Do you know \nany good guilds?'
274738:'Getting ready is the \nbest part of traveling. <PAGE>I haven't gone traveling with \na group in a long time. \nI can't wait to do it again.'
274747:'Wow, this city is \nreally wonderful... <PAGE>It'd be better without \npeople making all that \nruckus at night, though. '
274750:'Although the life of the \nflower is short, it still \nblooms with all its energy. <PAGE>I really like to \nwatch these flowers.  '
274752:'Regardless of how anxious I feel, \nI forget all my troubles when I \nlook at the beautiful blossoms. <PAGE>I don't know if that's \ngood or bad...'
274753:'We're all going to die \nanyway. We'd all be \nhappier as friends. '
274754:'We can watch the blossoms again. \nWatching the night in Halure and \ndrinking under the blossoms...'
274755:'But, the barrier is the reason we \ncan lose ourselves in our thoughts \nin the silence of the night. '
274756:'People must use the night to rest, \nbut the Tree of Halure goes on, \ntirelessly protecting our town.'
274757:'We have to study more \nto understand the \nimportance of the Tree...'
274758:'Just like darkness envelopes all, \nthis Tree envelopes the city.  <PAGE>Thankfully, we're able \nto sleep soundly. '
274759:'Going on a trip...\nYeah, I guess that's \ntoo much to ask...<PAGE>But I would like to see \nAspio at least once. '
274762:'If you follow the \nhill up, you'll arrive \nat the Tree of Halure. <PAGE>It has been restored \nto beautiful life!'
274763:'Flowers at night \nare so elegant.'
274764:'The sun has set, but it will rise \nagain in the morning. Flowers may \nfall, but they will bloom again. '
274765:'This is the law of nature. '
274766:'I was told to stay late and \nfinish my work for the day. \nThat's why I can't sleep. '
274767:'But I really don't \nhave anything that \nI need to do. '
274770:'We're all going to die...'
274771:'I don't like it here \nbecause the nights \nare dark and cold. '
274772:'The night...<PAGE>The night really makes \nyou thankful for the sun.'
274773:'A monster may dwell in \nthe Tree of Halure. <PAGE>In an ever changing world, \nflower viewing remains the same. \nMany that come here just for that. '
274774:'The charm of the Tree of \nHalure is so powerful you could \nalmost call it a monster.'
274776:'It's been a while \nsince humans have \ncome to Myorzo. <PAGE>You can enter the city, \nbut please keep quiet. \nEveryone is sleeping.'
274777:'I am a gatekeeper \nfor this city. We love having \nvisitors from outside! <PAGE>If you arrived during the \nday, the entire city would have \ncome out to welcome you. '

274903:'The Knights decided \nto ignore the lower \nquarter as usual. <PAGE>I mean, they didn't do \nsquat about the aque \nblastia either, right?'
274904:'<STR>(FRE) hasn't come \nback to Zaphias... \nWe're in trouble. '
274905:'The citizens of Zaphias\nescaped with <STR>(FRE). <PAGE>Maybe I should have \nfollowed them... '
274906:'It's already over for Zaphias. '
274907:'Whew... It's taking \na while to get things \ncleaned up. <PAGE>We need at least a \nfew more people...'
274908:'Maybe I should ask \n<STR>(FRE) if he can \nlend us some people.'
274909:'I've lived a long time, \nbut I never thought I'd \nsee a monster like that... <PAGE>I thought my dentures \nwere gonna fall out.'
274910:'I was so surprised, \nmy dentures popped \nright out of my mouth. <PAGE>Better be careful.'
274911:'My dentures actually \nfell out of my mouth. <PAGE>That jolt from the north \nspooked me so bad, \nand pop! Out they came.'
274912:'Can I get your \nhelp to find them?'
274913:'Welcome! The sun may have set, \nbut the store's still open. So \ndon't worry if you forget something.'
274914:'Thanks! \nPlease come again. I'll \nbe waiting for you here.'
274915:'Do some shopping and \nforget all your worries!'
274916:'Thank you! \nCome again, even if it's \njust to make fun of me!'
274919:'You've been working late! \nI'll be working late too...'
274920:'Thank you! \nMake sure you brush your \nteeth before going to bed!'
274921:'I won't be leaving any time soon. \nThat's the heart of a merchant. \nGo ahead and make your selections. '
274922:'Thank you! \nMake sure you take a \nbath before going to bed. '
274923:'The number of products don't match. \nMaybe they're rolling around somewhere? \nCould you keep an eye out?'
274924:'Thank you! \nDon't work so hard \nyou oversleep!'
274925:'The Knights have continued \nworking into the night. \nI can't slack off. Welcome!'
274926:'Thank you! \nSee you tomorrow!'
274927:'Recently, small incidents \ndon't really rattle me. \nWatch how I am tonight!'
274928:'Thank you! \nDream good dreams!'
274929:'I don't think the water is \ngoing to stop at all. I've been \nworking like this all day... <PAGE>I'm starting to get tired. \nHey, trade places with me...'
274930:'I'm totally wet \nfrom working all day... <PAGE>Water, women... \nYeah, I know what \nyou're thinking.'
274931:'One day this water will \nrun out and we won't \nknow what to do... <PAGE>But we'll survive if \nwe work together. '
274932:'You shouldn't be out \nand about with a \nwoman at this hour. <PAGE>Do you want me \nto tell <STR>(FRE)?'
274933:'Are you all out \non night patrol? <PAGE>Be careful the Knights \ndon't catch you as they \nmake their rounds.'
274934:'It is time for good \nchildren to be sleeping. <PAGE>Who is this bad \nadult that has \ntaken you out?'
274935:'I remember swimming in \nthis fountain after coming \nback on a hot day the other time. <PAGE>That was quite nice.'
274936:'I won't be swimming today \nbecause it’s not that hot.'
274937:'I'm so worried \nI can't sleep. <PAGE>The monsters may come \nand attack if the \nbarrier is unstable.'
274938:'There are other people that \nstayed behind too. I'm sure we'll \nendure if we all stick together. <PAGE>My girlfriend is still in the \ncapital. I cannot be weak.'
274939:'When I think about a lower quarter\nwhere everyone can live safely, \nI just have to do something.'
274940:'I want to get it back \nto what it was, before \nyou or <STR>(FRE) return.'
274941:'I'm cooperating with \nthe monster warnings. <PAGE>It must be very hard on the Knights. \nI was hoping my contribution would \nalleviate some of that burden.'
274942:'It's be awful if the Knights \nwere infested with people who \nwould do evil at any chance. <PAGE>Anyway, I can probably only \ntake over guard duties.'
274943:'I heard <STR>(FRE) built a new \ntown, but I'm sure he'll come back \nto the lower quarter sometime. <PAGE>To be more accurate, \nhe'll return to the castle\nbecause he's a Knight. '
274944:'<STR>(FRE) can't leave the lower quarter\nto fend for itself, either. \nHe's just like <STR>(YUR). '
274945:'It seems that \nthe aque blastia went \ncompletely bust. '
274946:'For now, I collected some of \nthe water that overflowed. <PAGE>I'm sure we can survive on that \nfor a while... But first off, \nwe need to stop the fountain.'
274947:'I hear that Mordio escaped? <PAGE>I remember how big he was, but I \ndidn't get a look at his face \nbecause he was wearing a hood. '
274948:'<STR>(YUR), I can't believe the \nImperial Knights arrested you \ninstead of chasing Mordio. <PAGE>Well, I guess with the stuff \nyou pull everyday, they do \nhave their reasons...'
274949:'Don't wander outside \na lot at night. You're \na wanted person.'
274950:'I won't be able to sleep for \nanother 3 hours because I \njust ate a piece of cake. <PAGE>Why can't I ever \nconquer temptation?'
274951:'Are you going \nto the city? <PAGE>If you're going up, \nthere something that I \nneed to you to purchase. '
274952:'You know that I have to \nclimb that steep hill to \ngo up? It's really steep.'
274953:'What happened to <STR>(FRE)? \nHe always comes running \nin emergencies. '
274954:'The only Knight I \ntrust is <STR>(FRE).'
274955:'I'm praying to the skies. '
274956:'I'm sure that my dead \nhusband is keeping an \neye on me from above.'
274957:'We should ask the government \nto fix public blastia. <PAGE>Of course, I doubt they'd \never get around to fixing a \nblastia in the lower quarter. '
274958:'You all wouldn't believe \nwhat the Empire does \nwith its finances. <PAGE>Do you have any idea how little \nof our hard-earned taxes actually \nmake it back to the lower quarter?'
274959:'You know that the throne is \nvacant, right? But the country \ncontinues to operate. <PAGE>So the emperor is \njust symbolic.'
274960:'The Empire is actually \nrun by the Imperial \nCouncil and Knights. <PAGE>The Council and the Knights \nhave about equal strength. '
274963:'A monopoly on blastia gives you power. <PAGE>For example, the barrier blastia. \nThis city would be annihilated in an \ninstant if they took that away.'
274964:'The emperor can use \nthe blastia for absolute \ncontrol over the citizens. <PAGE>Isn't it dangerous to \ngive the emperor such \npowerful authority? '
274965:'With the chaos in the Empire, it's \na good time to question whether the \nimperial family are worthy administrators. <PAGE>Any one not thinking hard about the \npolitical situation now has no \nright to be a citizen of the Empire. '
274966:'What I'm trying to do is figure \nout if you're really qualified \nto be a citizen of the Empire<PAGE>...You're not really listening, \nare you? You're bored. It's \nwritten all over your face...'
274967:'Halt! \nIf you go any further, \nyou'll leave the city. <PAGE>There are always more vicious \nmonsters on the prowl at night. It's \ndangerous for you equipped like that.'
274968:'You cannot be allowed \nto leave the city with such \nlight equipment. <PAGE>Come back with the \nproper armaments \nduring the day.'
274969:'An emergency order has been \nissued to seal off the capital. \nI cannot permit you to pass.'
274970:'The gate is sealed. \nNo one may pass until \nthe order is lifted.<PAGE>It seems a little shady that \nyou want to leave at night. \nYou, you're not thinking...'
274972:'It's manual. <PAGE>Welcome to the Imperial \nCapital of Zaphias.'
274973:'I'm worried about that strange \naurora surrounding the castle, \nbut I can't leave my post. <PAGE>What happened to the other knights? \nAre they defending the castle? \nNobody's telling me anything!'
274974:'Regardless of the \nsituation, my duty is \nto guard this place. <PAGE>I'll carry out my duty \nuntil the end while wearing \nthe blue sword insignia.'
274976:'Welcome to the Imperial \nCapital of Zaphiaaah......\n... I'm sleepy'
274977:'I can't lose my \nconcentration especially, \nwhen guarding at night. '
274978:'When something like \nthat happens, I am so \nthankful for the barrier. <PAGE>I have now realized its value \nfor a good night sleep. '
274979:'The Knights promise tranquil \nnights in the capital that \nnever change, no matter what.'
274980:'Sleep soundly.'
274981:'Welcome to Art Paradise! <PAGE>Your eternal smile copied \nonto the canvas invites me \nto an Eden of ecstasy.'
274982:'Fate has brought before \nme, with the heavenly brush, \nthis amazing subject. <PAGE>Will you be my model? \nLet's create Eden together.'
274983:'............<PAGE>Do you think it's strange? \nThere are nights that I \nget sentimental too.'
274984:'The monsters dwell at night. \nDarkness covers sky, and eats \naway at the hearts of the people. <PAGE>I draw the people's momentary \nsadness. I am the stained glass \nof the people's heart.  '
274985:'What? \nMy wanted posted doesn't \nlook like you? <PAGE>Whether the resemblance is \nthere or not is nonsense! \nThat drawing is a work of art.'
274986:'Ahh, a drawing from the back? \nThis is my lukewarm kindness to \npeople who do not understand art. <PAGE>Sometimes even scribbling is \nnecessary to earn money for food.'
274987:'I'm waiting for \nthe dragon to come. <PAGE>I watch and wait every night... \nOh, my magificent dragon...'
274988:'I've been awake all night... I'm so...<PAGE>No! How could I do this if I \nwere asleep? I will keep going \nuntil I draw the dragon...'
274989:'That's how it was. \nOr was it this way? <PAGE>It's not like this. \nThat phoenix was \nmore like...'
274990:'Don't interfere! Don't \nblame me if I burn you with \nmy burning artistic heart! <PAGE>Heh heh heh... ♪ Fire!'
274991:'The present capital\nis very interesting! <PAGE>Some people are frightened, \nothers struggle to escape... They all \nhave quite unusual expressions.'
274992:'Do you think that's a little \nshameless? But it's my duty as an \nartist to draw people's expression. <PAGE>There's more value in drawing \nthese real expressions than \nmaking up smiling faces.'
274993:'Next, I'd like to draw \nthe two young candidates \nto the emperor's throne.'
274994:'I heard the two candidates \nare allowed to walk around \noutside without a bodyguards!<PAGE>I would like to express \ntheir fearless and bold \ncountenances on canvas!'
274995:'Welcome! \nWhat are you searching for? \nStay and look around. '
274997:'Fortune's Market, where \nwe offer goods and dreams. \nMake this you favorite shop!'
274998:'We're happy to have \nyou any time.'
275000:'Fortune's Market, \nwhere we're always by \nyour side! Come again!'
275001:'The guild's management told me to \nincrease nighttime profitability. \nSo...could you buy something?'
275003:'Fortune's Market, where there's \na heart for business and first-class \nproducts! Thanks for visiting!'
275004:'There shouldn't be problems with \nnight-time business under these \nconditions. Have a look around. '
275006:'Fortune's Market, \nwhere business is life! \nThanks for coming!'
275007:'Welcome! We won't close \nour night business as long \nas there are customers.'
275009:'Fortune's Market, where we're all \nmerchants until we die! \nThanks for coming!'
275010:'The shop is open at night \nbecause you never know when \nsomeone might get hurt. '
275012:'Fortune's Market, where \nyou're happy we're still open! \nThanks for coming!'
275013:'We're staying open because we \nbelieve in the capital's tomorrow. \nWe got great products today!'
275015:'Fortune's Market, in step with \ntomorrow's bright future! \nThanks for coming!'
275016:'...What are you looking at?'
275017:'Are you lonely?'
275018:'You finally have someone \nthat'll stick with you.'
275019:'I know that you're \nhappy, but you don't have \nto come and show off...'
275020:'I'm <STR>(FRE) Defense \nForce member 006.♪ <PAGE>Don't tell him. \nIt's a secret.'
275021:'You'll become bored \nof eventless days. <PAGE>Life has to have \nsome excitement!'
275022:'Don't you feel \nempty staring at us?'
275023:'Poor thing. '
275024:'...Are you boasting?'
275025:'Aren't you trying too \nhard? Aren't you part of the \nwrong social standing? <PAGE>It's not about the \nnumbers. It's about the \ndepth of your love.'
275026:'My girl friend is acting strange. \nShe says she has other plans and \nwon't go out on a date with me. '
275027:'My girl friend is sitting \nright beside me, and she \nwon't even look my way. <PAGE>What's going on, \nall of a sudden?'
275028:'The previous emperor, Krunos \nXIV, passed away due to an \nillness that was going around.'
275029:'Although the Emperor is determined \nhereditarily, Krunos XIV didn't \nhave a direct successor. <PAGE>That's why the selection \nof the next Emperor has \nbeen a lingering issue. '
275030:'The wind at night is chilly. '
275031:'Longjohns are essential \nwhen going out at night. '
275032:'The taxes rose again. \nThe taxes in Zaphias\nare too high. '
275033:'The Council gets to do \nwhat they want in the \nabsence of the emperor. <PAGE>I'd like to see \nthe emperor take \nover the throne.'
275034:'Zaphias holds so many memories \nfor me. The house that I inherited \nfrom my parents is here, too. <PAGE>It may be dangerous, but I \ndon't really want to leave.'
275035:'I am prepared to \nbe buried here. '
275036:'What's up with the Knights recently? <PAGE>I heard they seized the castle, \nsplit into two groups and are \nnow fighting each other. '
275037:'Isn't it the job \nof the Knights to \nguard Zaphias? <PAGE>How can they fight each \nother and just ignore \nthe capital completely?!'
275038:'The monster is \nwrithing in the sky...'
275039:'I can't sleep wondering \nwhen that monster will \ncome crashing down.'
275040:'That monster up there... \nDid it always live there \nin the sky? <PAGE>So we've been \nliving under that \nmonster all this time.'
275041:'That's scary!'
275042:'I lived in another city \nbefore coming to Zaphias. <PAGE>I've been living away \nfrom other Krityans \nfor a while now.'
275043:'Nighttime is when \nI'm really glad that \nwe have blastia. <PAGE>I mean, I couldn't sleep \nat night without a barrier \nblastia. I'd be so worried...'
275046:'Hey! You're that \nwanted guy!<PAGE>I would help keep the \ncapital safe if I caught \na wanted man...<PAGE>For now, I need to start \nwith meeting more \npeople in the capital. <PAGE>Now I know the lower quarter\nand the people who live here.'
275048:'The Knight standing in front \nof the gate now is different \nfrom the usual Knight. <PAGE>He's got a bad \nreputation because he's \nalways slacking off.'
275049:'I want to guard \nthe gate instead. '
275050:'I thought the blastia was \nsecure, but I guess not...'
275051:'There is something \nstrange going on with aer \nwith this much disarray...'
275052:'I decided to guard the \ncapital and its citizens. <PAGE>The area around the barrier \nhas calmed down, but that \ndoesn't mean nothing will happen.'
275053:'Should we really \nrebuild the town now? <PAGE>Everyone evacuated the \nlower quarter. We don't \nhave enough people. '
275054:'Can we count on \nthe Knights or not?'
275055:'There are all kinds of Knights. Some \nwho would give their lives to fight, \nand some who just run away. <PAGE>It's nice that people are \ndifferent, but can an organization \nreally function like that?'
275056:'It's been a while since \nI battled monsters. I remember \nhow I used to feel. <PAGE>I guess this is what \nI'm cut out to do.'
275057:'Maybe I'll join \nthe Knights. <PAGE>I should infuse some energy \ninto those wimps and rebuild \nthem from the inside.'
275058:'I ran out of sugar when \nI was making dinner. '
275059:'You live in the lower \nquarter, right? <PAGE>Why don't you come over \nfor dinner sometime?'
275060:'The lower quarter is \nhaving water issues. <PAGE>I can't make dinner \nwithout water.'
275061:'Did you eat dinner \nalready? If not, how \nabout eating at my place?'
275064:'There's a meeting for \nthe <STR>(FRE) Defense Force. \nI have to hurry. '
275065:'I'm late because \nI was preparing dinner \nfor my family. <PAGE>I should have each person \njust buy whatever on \ntheir own from now on.'
275066:'The imperial family monopolized blastia \nand got hooked on money and power. \nThat's why Zaphias wound up like this.'
275067:'Isn't it about time that \nthe citizens rebel against \nthe imperial family?'
275068:'What's going to happen \nto the Empire?'
275069:'We have our share of \nuncertainty in our ranks. But \nwe must protect the capital. <PAGE>That is our solemn \nduty as Knights.'
275070:'We're all gonna end up \ngetting eaten by monsters, \nanyway. I'm going to bed!'
275071:'This 'round the clock guard \nduty can't go on forever. \nOur bodies'll apart.<PAGE>You either die now, or you die \nlater. That's the only difference. \nFighting is such a waste of time.'
275072:'Inns are always busiest at night. \n<STR>(YUR), you of all people \nshould know that! <PAGE>If you're not gonna help \npeople outside, go clean up \nthe bottles from that table.'
275073:'<STR>(YUR), if you're gonna rest, \njust go on to your own room. <PAGE>I'll get a room ready for \nyour lady friend, too.'
275074:'Did you feed \n<STR>(RAP)? <PAGE>If not, I have \nsome leftovers \nyou can give him.'
275075:'What do you want \nfor dinner, <STR>(YUR)? \nI'll cook whatever you like.'
275076:'Your room's \nready for you, \nso you can go on up.<PAGE>Relax, nobody's gone in your room, \n<STR>(YUR).  Of course, that means \nit hasn't been cleaned, either.'
275077:'You came all the \nway back here. Why don't \nyou take a break?'
275078:'<STR>(YUR), just take your time \nand do what you need to do.'
275079:'Ted's sick, \nso he's resting \nnow. <PAGE>I swear, that child. \nI told him not to go out, \nbut did he listen? No...'
275080:'If this weirdness keeps up, \nI don't think we'll be able to \nkeep living in the capital. <PAGE>I'll hold on for a \nlittle longer, though.'
275081:'Welcome back, <STR>(YUR). \nYou sure are working hard.'
275082:'You make sure you rest \nproperly, now. Go on. \nEveryone already went up!'
275083:'I don't care if the barrier \ngoes down or monsters attack. \nI will protect this home. <PAGE>So don't you worry \nabout us back here, <STR>(YUR).'
275084:'I'll be sure you have \na home waiting for you \nwhen you get back.'
275085:'You know, <STR>(YUR), you and <STR>(FRE)\nstarted out with different purposes, \nbut now you're working together. <PAGE>It's kinda nice to see you \ntwo working together again.'
275086:'I'm sure we'll be all right with you \nand <STR>(FRE) working together. Show \nthem what you're made of, <STR>(YUR)!'
275087:'<STR>(YUR), you're still \nhanging around here?<PAGE>The old lady's gonna kick \nyour butt if you don't \ndo what you gotta do.'
275088:'Owww...\nThe old lady should lighten up...<PAGE>I was just sitting out back for \na little bit. Okay, so \nmaybe I had a drink... '
275089:'Hey, if you have some \ntime, could you go get \nsome water for me?'
275090:'You know what? \nThe old lady is \nso nice to you. <PAGE>I mean, even if she yells at you, \nshe never kicks your butt. \nIt's, like, everyday for me.'
275091:'You're gonna stay \nhere tonight, right? <PAGE>Let's have a drink after \nI finish my work.'
275092:'Tell me about your travels. \nMan, I'm finally gonna get \nto have a fun night. <PAGE>...If the old lady doesn't \ncome barging in, that is.'
275093:'It looks like they set up a \n"<STR>(FRE) Defense Force" \nin the citizen quarter. <PAGE>I hear Ted got \ninterested and started \noffering them information.'
275094:'So, hey, where's the \n<STR>(YUR) Defense Force?'
275095:'The guy that used to work \nfor us left the capital, too. <PAGE>Now I gotta find someone \nelse to do the work.'
275096:'Oh well. Business is pretty \ndead, now, so I don't need \nanyone right away. <PAGE>I'm actually more \nworried about getting \ncustomers than workers.'
275097:'Hey, <STR>(YUR). It's been a \nwhile since you first \nleft on your trip. <PAGE>Heh, I think trip has actually \ndone you a little good.'
275098:'You know, <STR>(YUR), those \nladies you're traveling with \nlook pretty strong. <PAGE>Come on, honestly. They wear the \npants, right? No matter how strong \nmen are, we're suckers for women.'
275099:'Don't worry, <STR>(YUR). \nEven if you all aren't around, we'll \nprotect the lower quarter.'
275100:'Yeah, we'll be all \nright. We'll just \ndo what we can.'
275101:'Man, this world \nis in bad shape. <PAGE>I guess you're up to \nyour necks in it, \nyourselves, huh, <STR>(YUR).'
275102:'Well, I'm not too worried if \nyou all are taking care of stuff. <PAGE>All of us will just be \nhere waiting for you and \n<STR>(FRE) to come home.'
275103:'Heeeey there pretty lady! \nHow about you and me crack open a \nbottle or ten and have us a night? <PAGE>...Hey, you're a guy?!'
275104:'Come on. A guy sitting \nnext to me ain't helping \nmy chances. Beat it.'
275105:'Hey! \nI heard about you! <PAGE>You got caught by the \nknights, right? \nI can't believe you're out.'
275106:'So let me guess. \nThey gave you stew, right? <PAGE>Choke down some stew, then puke \nit back up for the next guy, right? \nHah hah hah hah!'
275107:'Those two at that table over \nthere are always talking about \nserious stuff over their drinks. <PAGE>Come on, guys! Drinking's \nsupposed to be fun!'
275108:'You can still have fun \n*hic* drinking alone, \nright?<PAGE>Shut up nobody's talkin' \nto you go away stop \nbotherin' me... *hic*'
275109:'Sometimes a man \njust can't go home...'
275110:'I'm waitin' for all the \nhullabaloo to calm down. <PAGE>So don't go thinking I got \nkicked out. It's not that. \nNope.'
275111:'The largest mercenary guild\nis the Blood Alliance. <PAGE>They can be a little rough, \nbut they get the job done.'
275112:'There are actually quite \na few mercenary guilds. <PAGE>It's kind of hard to \nfigure out which guild\nto request a job from.'
275113:'The capital is truly amazing. \nIt's thriving! It's better \nthan any city I've seen.'
275114:'The lower quarter here is \noutside the castle walls. \nI wonder if that's because it's new. <PAGE>It's pretty scary being this \nclose to the edge of the barrier.'
275115:'There are more guilds\nin this world than there \nare stars in the sky. <PAGE>I don't think the \nGuild Union even knows \nhow many there are.'
275116:'Actually, I'm also associated \nwith a guild: Strollers' Map. <PAGE>It's mainly involved in \nwriting and publishing \nstories about travel. '
275117:'You should try going \nto Tolbyccia first. <PAGE>It's best to start off \nwith a continent that \nhas already been mapped.'
275121:'Even you, Yuri! We all joined together. \nIt's me. Me! \nYou must remember...'
275122:'The three of us used to play cards \nall the time on our days off.<PAGE>That was about the only thing \nI could beat the two of you at...'

275124:'We have to make on our ultimate decision. <PAGE>Should we stay or go? Get killed \nby the monters outside, or \ncooperate with those underground?'
275125:'If you don't want to be eaten \nalive, do you want to be crawling \naround on the ground? Hah hah hah. <PAGE>Okay, I've decided. When \nthe time comes, I'll go \nunderground. Let's dive!'
275126:'I can't! I can't! \nI can't continue to live \nin terror every day.'
275127:'Heaven is hell and this \nworld is hell. If I could \nonly have one, I'd pick...'
275128:'The monsters were cleared out of \nthe city, but they're hiding in \nthe darkness of the night... <PAGE>We can't let our guard down. \nWe have to be ready.'
275129:'The people down below are in more \ntrouble. The tangled buildings \nleave a lot of blind spots. <PAGE>Anyways, at least the \nbarrier was restored. '
275130:'Please. \nLet me rest... <PAGE>Can you at least keep it down \nin the mansion at night? \nYou're all awake for no reason. '
275131:'The fatigue from \nthe mental anguish \nis overwhelming...'
275132:'When the darkness of the night \nis scary, look to the sky. The \nstarry sky will bring you peace...'
275133:'Oh, it's cloudly tonight. \nWell, I guess there are \nnights like this, too...'

275135:'What are the Twelve Spears?\nUmm... I don't feel\nlike explaining it.'
275168:'There's not much point \nfretting over what may or \nmay not happen tomorrow. <PAGE>And we should be thankful for \nthe gifts that each new day \nbrings, whatever they may be.'
275169:'Depending on our attitudes, \nit's even possible to see \nsunshine on a rainy day.'
275170:'The Tree of Halure\nis mighty indeed. <PAGE>But it cannot solve \nmy problems for me.'
275171:'We must seek the answers \nto the questions we have \non our own.<PAGE>Wouldn't you agree?'

275216:'Now we can relax and walk \naround town, even at night. \nIt's all thanks to the Knights.<PAGE>And you guys, too. \nYou're the ones who \nchased Cumore off, after all.'
275217:'My mom and dad still bug \nus about staying up late. \nI guess nothing's perfect.'
275218:'You can still see \nthat thing in the sky \n at night...<PAGE>And I'm still scared.... \nBut I still look. '
275219:'I really want to go home... \nBut I'll stay a little longer, \njust a little bit longer. '
275221:'...If you don't shut up, \nI'll throw you in the slammer.'
275222:'If you insist on approaching the mansion \nat this hour, we'll have to arrest \nyou on suspicion of burglary.<PAGE>You'll keep away if you \nknow what's good for you.'
275224:'The assistant magistrate that left for \nZaphias yesterday has not returned. <PAGE>He was supposed \nto bring the payroll \nwith him. '
275225:'If we don't receive payment, \nthen all the work we've done \nhere has been meaningless...'
275226,275227:'There's no way I can \nlet you in during the \nmiddle of the night.'
275228:'I never knew working without \npay would be so meaningless.<PAGE>If they don't pay me \nwhat they promised... \nI hate this...'
275229:'Then again, I've been hearing rumors \nthat money's not even gonna have \nany value before too long...'
275230:'There was a landslide \non the north part \nof the continent? '
275231:'What I care about is the money we're owed...'
275232:'I wonder what that \ntower-mountain-city-thing is... <PAGE>Do you know what \nI'm talking about?'
275233:'I wonder who's living there. Do you \nthink it would be okay if we went?'
275234:'Even though the world's in a state of \npanic, when night falls, I still get \nsleepy... I can't seem to help it.<PAGE>Zzz...'
275235:'Zzz... \n...*Mumble, mumble.*'
275236:'The light house shines \nbrighter and stronger \nthan any star!<PAGE>It makes us feel safe, even in \nthe dead of night, just like the \nprotection of a loving father.'

275242:'You lot there... You're not \nHunting Blades, are you?<PAGE>You'd better not be, or you'd face\nimmediate arrest and judgment.'
275243:'If you're not, all is well.<PAGE>We're not interested in \nharassing the citizenry \nwith baseless arrests.'
