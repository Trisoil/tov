Having confirmed \nthe findings of their experiments \nby chance, the guild is gathering \ninformation that will allow their \nnewfound power to create a \nnew ally: elemental spirits.'
00230252:'Bodies in Crystal'
00230253:'The experiments conducted by Brave \nVesperia have succeeded in producing \na spirit at last.

00230256:'Birth of the Earth Spirit'
00230257:'Deep within the crystal forest of \nErealumen today, Brave Vesperia \ncame to the aid of the Hunting \nBlades who were under attack by \nthe enraged Entelexeia, Gusios.\n\nDetermining that the ancient beast \nwould fall under the power of \nthe Adephagos if left unattended, \nthe guild was unable to avoid \n<PAGE>taking arms against it.\n\nThe apatheia received from the \nfallen Gusios became a spirit \non the spot, and was renamed \nGnome by Estellise, for his \nunyielding perserverance.'
00230258:'Primordial Scars'
00230259:'Brave Vesperia arrived at Relewiese \ntoday, on the continent of Weccea.\n\nThe surface of the continent, as \nyet untouched by the hand of humanity, \nlies high atop an impregnable \ncliff. The jagged rows of stone \ngullies and canyons extending \nto the horizon here struck the \n<PAGE>guild as one of the most mysterious \nsights they have seen.\n\nThey have come in search of the \nEntelexeia who makes these lands \nits home, and if all goes well, \nthey will gain another spirit.'
00230260:'A Spirit Remembers'
00230261:'After defeating the Entelexeia Khroma \ntoday in the ancient cave of Relewiese, \nBrave Vesperia acquired the spirit \nof Sylph from the apatheia they \nreceived.

00230263:'The Entelexeia Phaeroh gave \ncouncil to Brave Vesperia \nthis morning in the mountains \nof the Sands of Kogorh.\n\nInjured in the attack on Zaude, Phaeroh \nentrusted the guild with his hopes, \nand consenting to join their \ncause, became an apatheia.\n\n<PAGE>Brave Vesperia converted the \ncrystal to its spirit form, \ngiving it the name Efreet.\n\nEstellise bestowed the title, \nand explained it to mean \n"the blazing one."'
00230264:'The Spirits Assembled'
00230265:'Brave Vesperia has succeeded \nin gathering together the \nfour elemental spirits.\n\nWith that goal accomplished, Rita \nunveiled her plan to combat the \nAdephagos by converting the world's \nblastia cores into spirits.\n\n<PAGE>Estellise was quick to note that \nan operation of this magnitude \nwill require the cooperation of \nthe world's people, and the guild \nhas resolved to wait until \nthe time is right to act.\n\nThe group was last seen heading \nto Nor to lay preparations \nfor the road ahead.'
00230266:'Return of the Ancient Tower'
00230267:'A tower reared up out of the ground \nnear Aspio, just after noon today. \nJudging from the scale of the massive \nmonolith, Aspio is thought to have \nbeen destroyed in the process.\n\nBrave Vesperia claims this is \nthe ancient Tower of Tarqaron, \nand believes its appearance \nto be the work of Duke.\n\n<PAGE>It would seem that the mysterious \nman wishes to do away with \nthe Adephagos, though by what \nmeans, no one can yet say.'

00230269:'Beginning last night and extending \non until dawn, the refugees from \nthe capital were ambushed by monsters \nas they attempted to cross the \neastern plains of Hypionia. \nFlynn and his brigade responded, \nand are doing all they can \nto repel the attackers.\n\n<PAGE>Lieutenant Sodia and the mage Witcher \nhurried to Nor to inform Brave Vesperia \nof the situation.

00230277:'It was decided at yesterday's \nassembly that the world's blastia \ncores will be used to eradicate \nthe Adephagos.\n\nAccording to the plan, the cores \nwill be converted into spirit \nform and injected into Vesperia \nOne.

00260048:'I eventually found my \ndentures, you know. <PAGE>But now we've \nlost my wife's...'

00260054:'The sky is \nso strange. <PAGE>I've never seen it \nlike this before...'
00260055:'I wonder if the same thing's \nhappening in Deidon Hold and \nHalure. I hope they're all right...'
00260056:'It looks like the weirdness in the \nsky cleared up, but some houses in \nthe lower quarter were damaged.<PAGE>The Knights won't do anything \nfor us, so I guess we'll take \ncare of things ourselves.'
00260057:'All we have to do with the \ndebris is clear it away, but the \nmain problem is the buildings. <PAGE>We just don't have enough \nable-bodied folk to work. If only \nthe evacuees would return...'
00260058:'With the barriers down the \nmonsters can get in, but are \nthere really that many monsters?<PAGE>Even if there are, \nI'm sure the Knights \nwill take care of them.'
00260059:'I hope the refugees that \nfled Zaphias are all right...'
00260060:'There was a rumbling from \nthe north, like an earthquake. \nWhat could that have been?'
00260061:'Maybe a giant monster like \nthe one in the sky erupted from \nthe ground? I sure hope not...'
00260062:'Welcome! I want to help \nout too, but I have to keep \nthe business running. <PAGE>This shop stays open, no \nmatter what. Don't want to \ninconvenience people, you know!'
00260063:'Thanks! Come back \nany time. Like I said, \nwe're always open.'
00260064:'The whole fountain mess \nseems to have calmed down. \nNow you're totally free to shop!'
00260065:'Hi! Wow, it's been a while! \nThe Knights were chasing you, \nweren't they? Is everything okay?'
00260066:'We'll always be here \nto help you out.<PAGE>Stop by anytime.'
00260067:'Thanks! \nCome back whenever \nyou're in Zaphias.'
00260068:'They say <STR>(FRE) is amazing! \nI almost want to hold a sale \nin his honor! ...Almost.'
00260069:'It was <STR>(FRE) that brought \nback the fountain blastia \ncore, after all!<PAGE>Come on, <STR>(YUR)! \nYou can't let him beat you!'
00260070:'What's going on...? Is the barrier \nblastia going weird? Yeah, \nwe're always open for business.'
00260071:'The sky may be weird, but I'm not \nleaving Zaphias. As long as people \nlive here, they'll need shops.'
00260072:'I can't keep my products \narranged right, but look around \nand pick out what you need.'
00260073:'Sorry it's still such a mess. \nDon't let it put you off! \nCome back soon!'
00260074:'Things may be crazy, \nbut you have to keep your cool. \nYou should shop with a clear mind.'
00260075:'Thanks! Come \nback any time.'
00260076:'I hear <STR>(FRE)'s building a town \nsomewhere. You should buy him \nsomething for all his hard work!'
00260077:'Thanks, buddy! \nIf you see <STR>(FRE), \ngive him my best.'
00260078:'The fountain blastia is \nbroken... At this rate even \nthe houses will be flooded!<PAGE>We have to stop the flow first. \nWe'll think about pumping out \nthe excess water later.'
00260079:'<STR>(YUR), don't just \nstand there! \nYou help out too!'
00260080:'Well well, <STR>(YUR), the \nKnights certainly are \nfond of you.<PAGE>Leblanc and his troupe \nwere just running around \ncalling your name.'
00260081:'Be careful you don't do \nsomething to get <STR>(FRE)\nchasing after you, too!'
00260082:'Hey, didn't you leave \nthe city because the \nKnights were chasing you? <PAGE>What, did you forget something?'
00260083:'It'd be best if you \ndidn't come back. \nYou never know. <PAGE>Somebody could tell the \nKnights about you.'
00260084:'If it isn't the wanted \nman, <STR>(YUR)!♪<PAGE>You've got that big bounty \non your head, maybe you \nwant us to catch you?'
00260085:'Don't worry, <STR>(YUR). <PAGE>Turning you in for \na reward wouldn't make \nme very happy.'
00260086:'Looks like the false \ncharges got dropped.<PAGE>I always believed in you, <STR>(YUR).<PAGE>Really! I did!'
00260087:'Do what's right, even if the \nKnights are chasing you. \nThat's you, <STR>(YUR).'
00260088:'The fountain blastia's been fixed!♪ \nIt's all thanks to <STR>(FRE)\ngetting the core back.∀<PAGE><STR>(FRE)'s so popular. \nI hear there's even a \n<STR>(FRE) Defense Force.'
00260089:'The <STR>(FRE) Defense \nForce is really just \na fan club. <PAGE>It sounded like fun, \nso I joined too!♪'
00260090:'To think the aque blastia \nhad just been repaired! \nThey must've done a shoddy job. <PAGE>I even used money I'd\nsaved for my wedding \nto get it fixed...'
00260091:'Well, whining isn't going to stop \nall this water. We have to do \nsomething about the fountain. <PAGE>I'd never forgive \nmyself if I let my \ngirl drown.'
00260092:'Well, the water stopped, but \nnow we can't use the fountain. \nSooner or later the water will run out. <PAGE>We better start \nthinking about other \nways to get water.'
00260093:'I used the money I got \nback from the shoddy repair to \nfind new sources of water.<PAGE>My wedding? Nah, we just put it \noff for a little. She'll wait for me. \nBut thanks, <STR>(YUR).'
00260094:'The lower quarter's the same \nas always. The fountain \nblastia is still broken.<PAGE>There's no point in getting \nworked up about it. \nWe'll fix it in good time.'
00260095:'That blastia breaking was bad, \nbut it brought the people of \nthe lower quarter together.<PAGE>Even my girl says \nshe's counting on me... \nHeh heh.'
00260096:'Wow, <STR>(FRE)'s amazing! \nYou hear he made captain?<PAGE>It's thanks to him our fountain's \nback in shape, too. He's the \npride of the lower quarter.'
00260097:'<STR>(FRE)'s promotion to \ncaptain makes me as \nhappy as if it were myself.'
00260098:'What's that thing \nin the sky that looks \nlike an aurora? <PAGE>Ever since it appeared, the \nsky's been so strange...'
00260099:'What, now the barrier blastia's \nbroken? At least the monsters \nhaven't invaded yet.<PAGE>We have to protect this \ncity. The lower quarter \nis my only home.'
00260100:'This is like the \ndevastation after a \ngiant storm, or something. <PAGE>When things are this bad, \neven getting depressed \nabout it feels stupid.'
00260101:'No point in getting all weepy. \nWe've got to work \ntogether and rebuild.<PAGE>If we can get the lower quarter\nback in shape, maybe everyone \nwho left will come back.'
00260102:'The refugees started coming \nback after things got back \nto normal in Zaphias.<PAGE>Of course, that was right when \nthe monsters showed up and the \nbarrier broke... What a life!'
00260103:'What's become of \nour Zaphias?'
00260104:'<STR>(FRE) took everyone \nto a town with a new barrier. <PAGE>What are you going \nto do, <STR>(YUR)?'
00260105:'They have a barrier, so it's \nsafer there. But I don't want \nto leave the lower quarter.<PAGE>I'm going to stay in the \nlower quarter to the bitter end.'
00260106:'All water for the lower quarter\ncame through that aque blastia... \nNow the pumps in our homes are dry.<PAGE>I don't really understand it, \nbut my husband says the broken \nfountain is the reason.'
00260107:'I'm worried about water in the \nlower quarter. We can't cook, \nwash clothes, take baths... <PAGE>I don't want to \nshower with the \ndirty river water.'
00260108:'Welcome back, <STR>(YUR). \nLooks like you've caused \na ruckus again.<PAGE>They're watching you, \n<STR>(YUR), so don't do anything \ncrazy, okay?'
00260109:'What are you going to do now? \n<STR>(FRE)'s doing his duty as a \nknight, but you...'
00260110:'If it isn't <STR>(YUR) and \nthe young lady.<PAGE>So you came back \nto Zaphias.'
00260111:'Don't even think \nabout going uptown.<PAGE>The Knights are still looking \nfor you all, <STR>(YUR).'
00260112:'They say <STR>(FRE)'s doing a great \njob with the Knights. It's all \nthe lower quarter can talk about.<PAGE>He brought back the fountain's core, \ntoo. They can't praise <STR>(FRE)\nenough, as far as I'm concerned.'
00260113:'You never change, do you \n<STR>(YUR)? Always letting \n<STR>(FRE) take the lead.<PAGE>I hope you'll show us what \nyou're really made of one of \nthese days, <STR>(YUR).'
00260114:'I sold the comb my late \nhusband gave me to help raise \nmoney to fix the blastia. <PAGE>It was the first gift \nhe ever gave me...'
00260115:'Will the house I spent so \nmany years together with \nmy husband in sink...? <PAGE>Why did I \neven bother...?'
00260116:'Thank you so much, <STR>(YUR). \nI think I'll be able to buy back \nthe comb my husband gave me. <PAGE>You seem to have some \ntrouble with the Knights... \nIs everything all right?'
00260117:'The aque blastia \nnever got fixed, did it?<PAGE>What if the barrier \nblastia broke, too? \nThat's a scary thought.'
00260118:'Is it safe for you to come \nback here, <STR>(YUR)? <PAGE>The Knights are all worked \nup looking for you.'
00260119:'Stay away from the \ncastle, you hear? \nThe Knights are on alert.'
00260120:'These are the \npeople you're \ntraveling with...? <PAGE>Isn't it a little dangerous \ntromping around with \ngirls and children?'
00260121:'You be careful now.<PAGE>Leave the dangerous \nthings to the Knights. \nDon't do anything crazy.'
00260122:'I knew you'd come! \n<STR>(YUR), it had to be you!<PAGE>What are you gonna do? \nWhat should I do to help?'
00260123:'<STR>(FRE) would always be here \nin no time when stuff like \nthis happened. Why not now?<PAGE><STR>(FRE) shouldn't live in \nthe castle when he could just \ncommute from the lower quarter.'
00260124:'So, <STR>(YUR), you went and \ngot yourself arrested, huh? Idiot! \nI guess that's like you, though.<PAGE>I went to the royal quarter\nsince you never came back. All \nthe nobles were talking about you.'
00260125:'You were in the castle, right? \nDid you see <STR>(FRE)?<PAGE>Tell <STR>(FRE) the \nlower quarter's \nin trouble!'
00260126:'Hey, you're back already? \nYou don't have to run \naway any more? <PAGE>What? You're leaving again? \nMake up your mind...'
00260127:'It's kind of \nlonely without \nyou around, <STR>(YUR)...<PAGE>Uhh... Nevermind...'
00260128:'<STR>(YUR)! I saw \nyour wanted poster.<PAGE>I can't believe there's \na bounty on you! You're \nfamous in the Empire!'
00260129:'But, it's <STR>(FRE)'s job to \nhunt down people with \nbounties on their heads, right? <PAGE>I sure don't want \nyou two to fight...'
00260130:'<STR>(FRE)'s a captain now! He got \nthe core back for the lower quarter\nand everything! He's amazing!<PAGE>And I know <STR>(FRE) will keep \nworking for the lower quarter, \neven as a captain.'
00260131:'Did you hear about the \n<STR>(FRE) Defense Force? <PAGE>They made me tell \nthem everything I know \nabout <STR>(FRE).'
00260132:'Ugh... \nI feel awful...'
00260133:'Ever since the sky went all \nfunny, something's just...not \nright. This is horrible...'
00260134:'It was terrible when I got \nback to the lower quarter!<PAGE>Grass like tree trunks covered \nthe entire lower quarter... \nI couldn't believe it.'
00260135:'I wonder if <STR>(FRE) will rebuild \nthings if we ask. I mean, \n<STR>(FRE)'s really important now!<PAGE><STR>(YUR), go and ask \n<STR>(FRE) for us!'
00260136:'<STR>(YUR), you're safe!<PAGE>Your friend said things were \nbad, so I was really worried.'
00260137:'No way you'd go down \nthat easy, right, <STR>(YUR)?'
00260138:'<STR>(FRE) built a new \ntown in Hypionia! \nIsn't that amazing?!<PAGE><STR>(FRE)... He's on \nanother level, seriously.'
00260139:'All the members of the \n<STR>(FRE) Defense Force followed \n<STR>(FRE) to his new town.<PAGE>They just don't get it! \n<STR>(FRE) would really remain \nhere in the lower quarter.'
00260140:'The aque blastia broke, huh?<PAGE>No surprise there. They only \nlet us have old beat-up blastia \nhere in the lower quarter.'
00260141:'If you've got a problem \nwith it, go tell the imperial \nfamily or the Council. <PAGE>They're the ones who \ndecide what we get.'
00260142:'You see that, beyond those buildings? \nThat's our barrier blastia, the Sword Stair. \nIt protects Zaphias from monsters.<PAGE>The barrier is incredibly important... \nOur lives and livelihood depend on it.'
00260143:'Almost all the towns in the \nEmpire have a barrier blastia, \nnot just here in Zaphias.<PAGE>Places without them have \nto fortify and arm themselves \nto keep the monsters out.'
00260144:'The knights will find a reason to \narrest anyone they don't like, \neven if you haven't done anything.<PAGE>It's not a good time to \ncome back here, <STR>(YUR).'
00260145:'I don't even \ntrust <STR>(FRE).<PAGE>They keep an eye on the \nlower quarter too. You \nshouldn't stick around.'
00260146:'The Empire has a monopoly on \nthe various blastia in Zaphias, \nincluding the barrier blastia.'
00260147:'Historically speaking, the \nemperors never had the authority \nto control access to blastia.<PAGE>The imperial family \ndoesn't know their place. \nFools, all of them.'
00260148:'After the to-do with Magistrate \nRagou, the Council's reputation \nhas taken a huge hit.<PAGE>Now the balance between the Council \nand the Imperial Knights is wavering... \nWhat will become of our Empire?'
00260149:'There's no question the Empire\nis in a state of disarray. <PAGE>The imperial family \nno longer has the \npower to quell this chaos.'
00260150:'Hey, <STR>(YUR). \nYou come looking \nfor something? <PAGE>Anything you need for work should \nbe lying around here somewhere. \nTake whatever you need.'
00260151:'Onions, carrots, and...\nIs this crate booze bottles? <PAGE>Lucky I noticed, I was just about \nto kick this thing away and \nshatter them all. That was close!'
00260152:'So you're back, <STR>(YUR)? \nUp to your old tricks, I hear.'
00260153:'So who's the \nyoung lady? <PAGE>The poor thing. \nThis nasty place is \nnowhere to bring a girl.'
00260154:'Hey, welcome back! \nNice to see you're \nstill alive.'
00260155:'You should visit \nyour old room \nonce in a while, <STR>(YUR). <PAGE>If you don't take care \nof it, the dust in there \nwill start forming strata!'
00260156:'The Schwann Brigade, \nthe Cumore Brigade...\nAnd now the <STR>(FRE) Brigade?<PAGE>Impressive, that boy.'
00260157:'I hope the Imperial Knights \nimprove, even a little.'
00260158:'Halt! \nIf you go any further, \nyou'll leave the city.<PAGE>The world outside Zaphias' barrier \nis swarming with monsters. It's too \ndangerous for you equipped like that.'
00260159:'You cannot be allowed \nto leave the city with such \nlight equipment. <PAGE>Come back with the \nproper armaments.'
00260160:'An emergency order \nhas been issued \nto seal off the capital. <PAGE>None may pass.'
00260161:'The gate is sealed. \nNo one may pass until \nthe order is lifted.'
00260162:'They ordered \nthis gate closed...\nHey, you're... <PAGE>I'm going to go take a \nlook at the wanted poster. \nYou wait right here...'
00260163:'Hmmm... I can't tell \nif you look like the \nwanted poster or not...'
00260164:'Welcome to the Imperial \nCapital of Zaphias.'
00260165:'Welcome to the Imperial \nCapital of Zaph... Huh? \nYou're...not a traveler...<PAGE>Well, you look \nlike one...'
00260166:'There are monsters just \noutside the barrier! \nIt's far safer inside the capital!<PAGE>Citizens, stay calm. The \nKnights are protecting Zaphias. \nThere is no reason to evacuate!'
00260167:'Damn it all... \nWhat in the world \nis going on?'
00260168:'Welcome to the Imperial \nCapital of Zaphias.'
00260169:'Commandant Alexei\nrode off on a \nmonster somewhere. <PAGE>Maybe I should \nfollow him...'
00260170:'With the barrier gone, \nthe Knights are the last line \nof defense for the capital.'
00260171:'If Commandant Alexei brought this \ndisaster, then it is our duty to \nprotect the capital with our lives.'
00260172:'The monsters that invaded the \ncapital and caused all the uproar \nhave been taken care of. <PAGE>People can finally live in \nthe capital again safely again.'
00260173:'Zaphias is safe. \nThere is no need to evacuate.'
00260174:'Welcome! \nWelcome to my \nmagnificent atelier! <PAGE>Can you tell that I crackle \nwith ferocious creative power, \nthis very instant?'
00260175:'As you can see, I am an artist. \nI paint portraits, and now I find a \nspectacular subject before me! <PAGE>Will you allow me to paint your \nlikeness? It would surely flex \nmy dazzling creative muscles!'
00260176:'Wait, wait a moment! Has the good \nsir seen my work yet? It burns \nwith a palpable passion!'
00260177:'Your wanted poster. Your wanted \nposter, good sir! It was none \nother than I who painted it! <PAGE>You're a very distinctive young \nman, so I remembered it well. \nIt is a masterwork, is it not?'

00260214:'What's the town \nso restless about?<PAGE>It seems like the Knights \nare searching for someone.'
00260215:'There was such a commotion in \nthe lower quarter earlier about \ntheir fountain stopping.<PAGE>They could stand to be a little \nmore quiet. I'm trying to spend \nsome time with my sweetheart.'
00260216:'You're the scoundrel \nthe Knights are searching \nfor, aren't you? <PAGE>You certainly look \nlike a scoundrel.'
00260217:'Hey! I thought the Knights \ncaptured you? \nSo did they or didn't they?!'
00260218:'You're the one the Knights \nwere looking for earlier, right?<PAGE>What did you do? \nAnd how on earth could \nyou be innocent?'
00260219:'Whatever, just don't bother me. \nI'm spending time with my sweetheart.<PAGE>Don't you go \nstealing my heart. ∀'

00260221:'Not only is Captain <STR>(FRE) kind, \nhe's so good-looking!∀<PAGE>All the girls of Zaphias\nhave had their eyes \non him for a while.'
00260222:'With our barrier and thick \nramparts, Zaphias is the \nsafest place in the world...<PAGE>It's where the emperor lives, \nso the Imperial Knights \nkeep a very close watch.'
00260223:'I'm proud to \nbe from Zaphias. <PAGE>This is a wonderful place to \nlive, and more importantly, \nit's where I met my girl.'
00260224:'The capital has been sealed because \nsome thief the Knights caught \nin the royal quarter escaped.<PAGE>They aren't letting anyone \ncross through the barrier.'
00260225:'Isn't closing off the entire \ncity a little excessive? \nIt's such a bother for us citizens.'
00260226:'They still haven't caught the thief. \nThey put up pictures of the guy, \nbut they're terrible.<PAGE>Hey...\nYou kinda look like him...'
00260227:'Even a picture as bad as \nthat can capture a person's \nspecial features.'
00260228:'The pictures of the thief \nfrom the royal quarter\nwere finally taken down. <PAGE>I guess they finally caught him.'
00260229:'That's the Knights for you. \nAlways protecting the \npeace of the capital.'
00260230:'I heard the Knights uncovered \ntreachery by a magistrate and \nsaved the people of some town.<PAGE>You can always count \non the Knights!'

00260234:'Everyone in the city is so kind.<PAGE>I visit the lower quarter sometimes, \ntoo. It's so lively, and the \npeople are so nice. It's great!'
00260235:'If there's ever anything \nI can do to help you, \nplease let me know.'
00260236:'I think it's good that \nthe Empire manages \nthe blastia.<PAGE>People tend to forget that \nblastia are managed because they're \nsuch a part of everyday life.'
00260237:'There must be some reason \nfor blastia to be managed. <PAGE>I don't know what it is, but...'
00260238:'Do you know the saying, \n"To lack nobility is \nto lack humanity"?<PAGE>Ah, but of course you wouldn't. \nYou lot have no education, \nafter all. Forgive me.'
00260239:'The lower caste continues \nto work fussily about today, \nI see. How miserable.'
00260240:'They say some commoners \nbroke into one of the \nnoble mansions. <PAGE>Isn't that just like \nthe poor? They lack \nconscience and dignity!'
00260241:'The pauper filth should be \nhappy to polish our boots. <PAGE>Not that I'd let a wretch \nlike you anywhere near \nmy boots, of course.'
00260242:'Ever busy, ever \nbare, they say. <PAGE>How fitting.'
00260243:'You lot can't survive \nwithout working so hard you \nliterally cough up blood, yes?<PAGE>Sorry, but I have so much \nfree time I don't even \nknow what to do with it.'
00260244:'The Empire may appear \npeaceful, but its foundations \nare shaking. <PAGE>We still don't have \na new emperor.'
00260245:'It's already been six months \nsince Krunos XIV passed on... <PAGE>There aren't even any hints \nas to who the next emperor \nmight be. It is most unusual.'
00260246:'Apparently the \naspirants for emperor \nare quite young. <PAGE>Even if it's too early to ascend \nto the throne, they could at least \nlet us know who the successor is.'
00260247:'I'm so worried with no \nsuccessor named yet... <PAGE>Who's going to take \ncommand if there were \na state of emergency?'
00260248:'There are rumors the Council \nand Imperial Knights are clashing \nover the new emperor. <PAGE>It seems they both have \nan aspirant they favor to \ntake over the throne.'
00260249:'The power balance between the \nCouncil and the Knights could change \ndepending on the next emperor. <PAGE>I just hope whoever ascends \nto the throne truly cares \nfor their subjects...'
00260250:'The barrier is...whirling around? \nWait, is that even the barrier? \nI've never seen such a strange sky.'
00260251:'Many people have \nleft Zaphias.<PAGE>But I've lived in this city \nso long, I'd never be \nable to just abandon it.'
00260252:'Dragons and phoenixes were \nflying over Zaphias... \nWhat were they doing? <PAGE>I was sure they'd come to \nattack us, but it seems \nthe barrier blocked them.'
00260253:'It looks like the \nbarrier has stabilized. \nThank heavens.'
00260254:'What is that in the sky...?'
00260255:'Was the problem with \nthe barrier an omen that the \nsky would become so strange?'
00260256:'Thanks to the efforts of \nthe Knights, the capital\nwon't be attacked by monsters.<PAGE>Everyone who ran away \nacted much too rashly.'
00260257:'Putting aside the matter of \nthat incident with the Commandant, \nwe need the Knights. <PAGE>That state of Zaphias right \nnow is proof of that.'
00260258:'What's wrong, son? Are you lost? \nZaphias is a huge city, after all. \nVisitors get lost all the time.<PAGE>The capital is \ndivided into \nthree areas.'
00260259:'This is the citizen quarter. To the \nsouth is the lower quarter, and up the \nstairs to the west is the royal quarter.<PAGE>The castle is north. You can get \nthere from the royal quarter. \nYou'll know it by the huge gate.'
00260260:'Hey! You're the thief! <PAGE>I saw you getting chased!'
00260261:'Th-there's no way you're \nstealing from me! \nI-I don't have anything...'
00260262:'Y-you're...the \nwanted man!'
00260263:'Eeeyaaaah! \nD-don't kill me! \nYou can have all my money...'
00260264:'Whoa! \nHey, you're the kidnapper!\nDon't take me!'
00260265:'H-how could you be \ni-i-innocent when you \nkidnapped the princess?!'
00260266:'As long as we remain in \nZaphias there's nothing \nto fear from the monsters. <PAGE>We've got our barrier, \nand of course the Knights.'
00260267:'Zaphias is the safest \ncity in the world.'
00260268:'You see \nall the tents \nover there? <PAGE>They're the tents for \nthe morning market.'
00260269:'There are all \nkinds of vegetables \nand meats for sale. <PAGE>My mommy and daddy \nsell bread there too!'
00260270:'This morning I was \nhelping Mommy and Daddy. <PAGE>One of the customers \ncomplimented my pretty smile!'
00260271:'Everyone's says I'm \nlike the poster girl \nfor the market. <PAGE>What's a poster girl?'
00260272:'Welcome! \nYummy fresh-baked \nbread for sale!! <PAGE>Oh, sorry, I was just \npracticing. I don't actually \nhave any bread to sell.'
00260273:'Mommy and Daddy's \nbread is really tasty. \nCome and try it sometime!'
00260274:'I came to Zaphias\nhoping I could help \npeople, but... <PAGE>Now that I'm here, I don't \nreally know what to do.'
00260275:'I'm trying to find \nsomething I can help with. <PAGE>I suppose I'll have to \nmeet more people in \nthe capital first.'
00260276:'Hey you were running around \nwith some guys in armor earlier! <PAGE>That looked like fun! \nWhat kind of game was it?'
00260277:'I wanna play that \nchase game too!'
00260278:'Hey! You're that \nwanted guy!<PAGE>I would help keep the \ncapital safe if I caught \na wanted man...<PAGE>For now, I need to \nstart with meeting more \npeople in the capital. <PAGE>Now I know the lower quarter\nand the people who live here.'
00260279:'You look kind of like \nthat guy on the wanted \nposters, but...not... <PAGE>It'd be bad if they were \nreally false charges. <PAGE>People talk, you know, \nand it's good information \na lot of the time. <PAGE>It's a good idea to \nlisten to what people \nlike me have to say.'
00260280:'Zaphias may be a nice place \nto live, but that means its \ntaxes are that much higher. <PAGE>Prices went up again recently...'
00260281:'I don't have a regular job, \nand getting by from day to day \nis eating up my savings.<PAGE>*Sigh* \nMaybe I should just \ngo back to Halure...'
00260282:'Something's wrong \nwith the barrier...<PAGE>No, wait. Is this...aer?'
00260283:'Why would so much aer suddenly \nbe flowing through Zaphias?<PAGE>It seems to be coming from \nthe castle... Could the source \nbe the barrier blastia...?'
00260284:'The city's still in chaos, and now \nof all times the knight guarding the \nramparts has to be that guy...'
00260285:'The knight usually guarding \nthe lower quarter is a \ndependable, loyal person. <PAGE>He's in the Schwann Brigade. \nThe useless ones are in the Cumore Brigade. \nThe commanders make the difference.'
00260286:'I'm helping the Knights \nfight the monsters. <PAGE>I did the same \njob in Halure, so I'm \nsure I'm some help.'
00260287:'I borrowed a bodhi blastia from \na knight. I know the Council didn't \napprove it, but hey...<PAGE>I know it's against the rules and all, \nbut there are way more serious \nthings to worry about now.'
00260288:'Apparently the Knights \nprotecting the capital now \nare all pretty diligent guys. <PAGE>The worthless ones all \nran away a long time ago.'
00260289:'What kind of leadership did \nthe Knights have, anyway?<PAGE>With Commandant Alexei and all... \nI don't know what to think of \nthe Imperial Knights anymore.'
00260290:'The Imperial Knights \nare so cool!<PAGE>I'm gonna be \na Knight when \nI grow up!'
00260291:'I'll defend Zaphias! \nLeave it to me! <PAGE>Don't worry, \nI'll protect \nyou too!'
00260292:'I am a member of the Imperial \nKnights! Vile criminal! \nYou're under arrest!'
00260293:'I mean, come on. \nYou were just running \nfrom some Knights...'
00260294:'Hey! \nI saw your face \non a poster! <PAGE>If I brought you to the \nKnights they'd give me a \nlot of Gald, wouldn't they?'
00260295:'I'm gonna haul you \nin and have the \nKnights hire me!'
00260296:'Did you hear? The Knights \nhave a new brigade: \nthe <STR>(FRE) Brigade!'
00260297:'I met <STR>(FRE) before he \nwas a captain, you know. \nHe's a really nice guy! <PAGE>When I join the Knights \nI'm gonna be in the \n<STR>(FRE) Brigade!'
00260298:'Salt, check. Wine, check. Did \nI forget anything...? Ah, such \na lovely day for shopping.'
00260299:'Oh...are you from the \nlower quarter, young man? <PAGE>Tee-hee...what a handsome young \nfigure. I got an unexpected \nbonus with my shopping today!♪'
00260300:'Is it true the aque blastia \nin the lower quarter\nbroke? How terrible.'
00260301:'If you need water, \nbring some from \nthe citizen quarter.<PAGE>In troubled times we all \nhave to help each other out.'
00260302:'Oh my! You're \nthe one the Knights \nwere chasing! <PAGE>Do you really think it's \na good idea to be here?'
00260303:'Only nobles and \nroyalty should be \non this level.<PAGE>This isn't a place for \npeople from the \nlower quarter like you.'
00260304:'But you know, I was \nactually raised in the \nlower quarter, too.<PAGE>Being up here really \nmakes me miss the warmth \nof the lower quarter...'
00260305:'One of the guards over there \ntook a rock to the head \nand got knocked out. <PAGE>How pathetic...'
00260306:'You know, this armor is \nactually really thin. <PAGE>I really wish they'd \nsupply us with some \nheavier armor.'
00260307:'The royal quarter stretches \nall the way past this gate, \nalong the outside of the castle.<PAGE>They don't really like ordinary, \nworking people over there.'
00260308:'Maybe it's the whole thief thing, \nbut people stare at you just for \nbeing from the lower quarter.'
00260309:'It's almost overwhelming \nhow large the castle is \nwhen you're this close.'
00260310:'Our barrier blastia\n"The Sword Stair" is pretty huge too. \nIt kind of numbs your senses.'
00260311:'Ahead is \nZaphias Castle.'
00260312:'Common citizens are \nnot permitted entry.'
00260313:'Ahead is \nZaphias Castle.'
00260314:'We are currenly under \nheightened security. <PAGE>Withdraw at once or face \nimmediate arrest.'
00260315:'This is Zaphias Castle, residence of \nhis majesty, the Emperor.<PAGE>Not that there is \na current Emperor...'
00260316:'If you keep loitering \naround here I'll be \nforced to arrest you.<PAGE>So go on. Get lost.'
00260317:'This is the magnificent \nZaphias Castle.<PAGE>Security has been increased \nfollowing a certain criminal's \nescape the other day.'
00260318:'<STR>(FRE) was appointed \ncaptain and given his own \nbrigade to command.<PAGE>The <STR>(FRE) Brigade is a ranger unit. \nI'd much rather be traveling with \nthem than standing here all day.'
00260319:'Up ahead is the royal quarter.'
00260320:'You may enter freely, \nbut refrain from panhandling. <PAGE>Should you try anything so vulgar, \nyou will face immediate arrest.'
00260321:'Up ahead is the royal quarter.'
00260322:'Pets are permitted entry, \nbut you are required to \nobserve proper etiquette. <PAGE>You must clean up any \nmess they might make.'
00260323:'You there! Are you \ncrazy, walking around \nin your pajamas? <PAGE>I've never seen \nsuch unfashionable \nnightclothes in my life.'
00260324:'Would you mind not \nwalking so close to me? <PAGE>I don't want anyone thinking \nI'm with someone who has such \nan acute lack of fashion sense.'
00260325:'Hmm, that's an unusual \ndog you have there. \nWhat's the breed? <PAGE>Not that it's at \nall cute, of course.'
00260326:'One should choose their \npets very carefully. <PAGE>You can tell someone's \nstatus by what type of \npet they have, you know.'
00260327:'All the people that come to goggle \nat the castle and our stately homes \nlately are quite annoying.<PAGE>...Can't you take a hint? \nI'm talking about you.'

00260337:'The throne has been empty for \nsome time, but a successor \nwill soon sit upon it. <PAGE>If only the Imperial Knights \nweren't supporting their own aspirant, \nthe throne would be occupied.'
00260338:'The Council and the \nKnights support different \ncandidates for emperor. <PAGE>Honestly, I don't \ncare who wins.'
00260339:'The Commandant is a \nfool to think he could \nsimply become emperor. <PAGE>Well, I never thought he \nwould succeed anyway.'
00260340:'The Council spared no \neffort to avert this danger, \nbut to no avail... <PAGE>And the Commandant \nhas fled as well.'
00260341:'The Council members \nare on the brink of despair. <PAGE>However the flame of \nhope will not be \nextinguished so easily.'

00260356:'I imagine one of those \nlowly commoners has broken \nin to steal something. <PAGE>This is no place for low \nfolk to dawdle. Do you \nunderstand what I'm saying?'
00260357:'The wretched thief that \nbroke into that manor \nhas been caught!<PAGE>Well, I would like to \nthink I did my part to \nkeep the capital safe.'
00260358:'I saw the scoundrel break \ninto the mansion and \nreported it to the Knights. <PAGE>Captain Cumore took \ncare of him.'
00260359:'Once I informed the Knights, \nthey were kind enough to \npay me a small reward. <PAGE>Not that I can buy \nmuch of value with \n100,000 Gald.'

00260576:'Oh dear oh dear. \nI never thought I'd \nsee this happen...'
00260577:'You there! Travellers! Do you \nhappen to know a good mage who \ncould fix a barrier blastia?'
00260578:'The Tree of Halure used \nto protect our town.'
00260579:'Is this town finished?'
00260580:'Now Halure is safe, too.'
00260581:'As the Tree protects us, \nwe shall protect the Tree.'
00260582:'What are Imperial Knights \ndoing in Halure...?'
00260583:'I fear they might do something \nto damage the Tree.'
00260584:'The Knights left the \ncity afterwards. <PAGE>What in the world did \nthey come for? You \ncan't just work people up.'
00260585:'They didn't protect \nus before, so what \ndo they want now?'
00260586:'Our fates are intertwined with \nthat of the Tree of Halure.'
00260587:'We can decide \nour own destiny.<PAGE>If we can keep the \nTree of Halure safe...'
00260588:'The Empire and the Knights \nalways make fun of us. <PAGE>I guess the Knights and \nthe government are not \nfriends of the people.'
00260589:'Good Knights, bad Knights... \nCan we trust the \nKnights, can we not...? <PAGE>The only thing \nthat's clear is that \nthe top guy is bad.'
00260590:'The current situation may \nnot be favorable... but we \nmust stop lamenting the past.'
00260591:'We can't live looking backwards. \nWe must move ever forwards.'
00260592:'The disaster was unfortunate. \nAs long as we still live, \nhowever, there is hope.'
00260593:'I'm going to do my \nbest to bring the \nsurvivors happiness.'
00260594:'Sometimes living can \nme more difficult than \nsurrendering to death.'
00260595:'Nevertheless, \nwe must live on. <PAGE>We must put forth an effort \nnot to just survive, but to thrive.'
00260596:'I feel bad for \nrelying on outsiders \nfor help, but... <PAGE>Please, you have \nto do something...'

00260609:'This is a tranquil \ntown, famous for our \nbeautiful flowers.'
00260610:'This is the City of Blossoms, \nHalure. We have many refugees \nfrom the capital now.'

00260614:'A miracle. I don't \nknow who said it, \nbut it's beautiful. <PAGE>But we have to remember \nthat miracles don't \nhappen twice.'
00260615:'A miracle that happens \noften isn't a miracle.'
00260616:'If beautiful flowers should give \nyou pleasure, show your gratitude \nto the roots that birthed them...'
00260617:'It's an old saying \nwe have in Halure.'
00260618:'The Tree of Halure\nmay be massive, but even \nit began as a sprout.'
00260619:'You could say it was watered by the \nblood, sweat and tears of the people \nthat have always tended to it.'
00260620:'I think this will \nbring down the glory \nof the capital... <PAGE>Pride goes before \nthe fall...'
00260621:'Even if the capital \nwas destroyed, \nit's people weren't. <PAGE>The youth must be \nstrong and live.'

00260637:'The Tree of Halure is \nnot doing well. <PAGE>I have to get a doctor \nto examine the Tree!'
00260638:'But are there doctors \nfor trees...?'
00260639:'Ho! Listen! The Tree of \nHalure has come \nback to life! <PAGE>Uh... I didn't mean \nto say, "Ho." \n...Hey!'
00260640:'I guess a doctor came \nto see the Tree.'
00260641:'Some Knights came by. One \nof them kept saying, "I \nsay, I say" over and over.<PAGE>That's so weird...'
00260642:'Hey, mister, what do \nyou think they wanted?'
00260643:'Fall, snow... come on, snow. <PAGE>This is what snow is like, \nright? What do you mean, \nyou don't know?! Weak...'
00260644:'If these flower petals \nfell for 100 years, they would \nbury the houses. '
00260645:'I didn't know there was \ntrouble in Dahngrest. \nIt seems pretty bad.'
00260646:'Not that it has anything \nto do with us.'
00260647:'There were a lot of people \npushing and shoving. \nThey were like waves. '
00260648:'Why are those \npepole from the \ncapital so arogant. <PAGE>They just happened to be \nborn there! It's just luck!'
00260649:'I always felt so relieved and \nat peace when I looked around \nat this city's flowers. <PAGE>I can't believe this \ncould happen...'
00260650:'Every time I look up \nat the flowers at night, \nI'm just filled with sadness.'
00260651:'This world is full \nof suffering... <PAGE>But looking at the flowers \nin this city makes me \nglad that I'm alive. '
00260652:'Oh... I'm so glad the \nTree came back to life...'
00260653:'I don't like a whole lot of \ncommotion, but I hate not being \nable to just live my life in peace. <PAGE>I wonder if it was good \nor bad that the \nImperial Knights came.'
00260654:'It would be nice if this world \nwould continue to be peaceful \nwithout the Imperial Knights. '
00260655:'The flowers blossom beautifully. <PAGE>However, withered flower \npetals that bury the city \naren't necessarily beautiful. '
00260656:'Even beautiful things may \nnot always be beautiful \nin their last moments. '
00260657:'They bloom and wither, bloom and \nwither... The flowers of Halure\nalways repeat this cycle. <PAGE>All of this is \ndue to the direct \nblessings from aer. '
00260658:'Ahh, this is really \na magnificent city...'
00260659:'I'm worried whether those people \nwho escaped from Zaphias will \npay respect to that Tree. <PAGE>I wonder if we should \nteach everyone just how \nprecious the blossoms are.'
00260660:'No... \nMaybe we should just \nmind our own business?'
00260661:'Although the life of the \nflower is short, it still \nblooms with all its energy. <PAGE>I really like to \nwatch these flowers. '
00260662:'One day I'll die, my body \nwill return to the ground, and \nflowers will bloom above me. <PAGE>I want to continue \nliving forever, giving \nenergy to the flowers.'
00260663:'I may also die soon. <PAGE>Why? \nBecause my body \nfeels really weak.'
00260664:'I don't have any regrets, \neven if I die tomorrow. <PAGE>Why? \nBecause I can die under \nthose beautiful flowers.'
00260665:'I really like looking at the \nflowers... Having drinks while \njust gazing at the flowers...'
00260666:'I wonder if those happy \ndays will come again?'
00260667:'We'll be able to watch the \nblossoms again... Having drinks \nwhile watching the blossoms...'
00260668:'Flower viewing, \nflower viewing!♪'
00260669:'I thought the Imperial \nKnights also came to \nwatch the blossoms. <PAGE>Because they were \nloud even though they \nweren't drinking.'
00260670:'Do you want to check out the \nblossoms together? We'll \nhave a good time. Trust me.'
00260671:'Good drinks and \nbeautiful blossoms... <PAGE>They say, "Food over \nflowers," but you \ngotta have both.'
00260672:'I'm so glad that \nI came to this city. <PAGE>My hometown in the middle of \nthe mountains looks bleak. '
00260673:'It's nice being able \nto relax and look \nat the flowers. '
00260674:'Ohhhh, so relaxed... \nOhhhh, so drunk...'
00260675:'It's fun as more people gather. \nAhh... I know that we don't \nhave time to have fun. <PAGE>But I thought it \nwould be okay as it \nwas getting noisier. '
00260676:'It would be \nbetter if everyone \nlived here. <PAGE>Why don't you just \nhand over the capital\nto the Commandant?'
00260677:'Hmm... There must be some \nway to bring the Tree of \nHalure back to life...'
00260678:'I don't have the \nknowledge to look \ninto what caused it.'
00260679:'Isn't it great that \nthe Tree of Halure\nwas revived? <PAGE>But... we're worried about \nwhat we should do to ensure \nthe Tree does not die.'
00260680:'The more the Tree blooms, \nthe more concerned I am. \nHmmm...'
00260681:'Why did the Knights come \nto this city? Are they \nhere to collect taxes? <PAGE>I think we paid last month. \nYeah, we paid... \nWait... Did we?'
00260682:'Am I going to get arrested \nif I didn't pay taxes? \nHmmmm....'
00260683:'The water here is said \nto spring out from the \ntrunk of the Tree. <PAGE>Even if that was true, do you \nreally think this much water \nwould just keep coming out?'
00260684:'Do you think that the \nTree will run out of \nwater and wither again?'
00260685:'How did the Tree grow so big...? \nI can't sleep through the night \nwhen I ponder this question. <PAGE>There are so many \nthings to think about \nwith this town...<PAGE>Hmmmm...'
00260686:'There are just too \nmany things to think \nabout in life!'
00260687:'Why are there \nthis many people? <PAGE>This is a small city! \nWe can only handle so many \npeople... *Grumble*...'
00260688:'About 40,000 people per square \nkilometer... Know what that is? The \npopulation density of this city. <PAGE>Normally It's about 30 people... \nSomething is way out of whack!'
00260689:'I traveled all the way \nhere to see the flowers... \nBut the Tree has withered.'
00260690:'This is no time for \nflower viewing, it would seem...'
00260691:'I traveled all the way here \nto see the flowers...\nI'm glad it wasn't a waste.'
00260692:'I wonder when the best \ntime for flower viewing is?'
00260693:'What do the Knights \nwant in Halure?'
00260694:'I doubt they came \nfor flower viewing!'
00260695:'Why don't I get tired of \nwatching the flowers all day?'
00260696:'Even if I was watching a \nbeautiful woman, I'd get \ntired of her in a single night...'
00260697:'The flowers bloom, then fall... \nYear after year, the same cycle.'
00260698:'I suppose our lives are \nmuch the same thing...'
00260699:'I want people from the capital who \nhave faced horrendous times to \nlook at the flowers and be healed. <PAGE>And then I want them \nto tell the world just \nhow good Halure is. '
00260700:'No matter what's going on, looking \nat such beautiful trees makes you \nfeel like everything will be okay.'
00260701:'I can't believe monsters \nattacked... Why isn't the \nbarrier blastia working?!'
00260702:'I don't want to be eaten!'
00260703:'Now we'll be safe even \nif the monsters attack.'
00260704:'I really, really don't \nwant to be eaten...'
00260705:'Will the Knights \nprotect this town?'
00260706:'If they did, our defense \ncertainly would be tough.'
00260707:'I can no longer see the \nmonster that used to wander \nclose to the city until recently.'
00260708:'It probably gave up due \nto the blastia in this city. '
00260709:'Being young and beautiful is \nnothing special, but to be old and \nbeautiful... That is true beauty.'
00260710:'I wonder how old the \nTree of Halure is.'
00260711:'How should we welcome \nthe refugees? <PAGE>Should we console \nthem, or just not talk \nabout the situation...?'
00260712:'We don't know how to \ndeal with so many people \nfleeing at once. '
00260713:'The Tree of Halure may seem static, \nbut in fact it grew little by little \ninto the towering giant it is.'
00260714:'We are the same. \nLittle by little, day by \nday, we grow as well.'
00260715:'We need a blastia engineer \nto repair the blastia... <PAGE>But there's no one \nlike that in this city.'
00260716:'At this rate, the town will \nbe overrun by monsters...'
00260717:'The blastia started working \nagain when the flowers of \nHalure returned... <PAGE>What kind of place is this...? \nThis place is really interesting.'
00260718:'This is a good chance \nfor me to study blastia... '
00260719:'There seems to be \na town of mages to the \neast of this town. <PAGE>I'd like to go there \nand study the blastia. '
00260720:'I'd like to go to Aspio but\nstepping out of the barrier\nis dangerous. <PAGE>It's just my luck. '
00260721:'I'd like to study blastia and feel \nsecure enough to repair the barrier \nblastia if it ever falls apart. <PAGE>And this feeling grows \nstronger by the day. '
00260722:'I can't stop worrying \nabout when we will lose \nthe blastia again.'
00260723:'I've organized all the \nissues with the blastia \nin my head but... <PAGE>Argh... \nI can't think straight with \neverything going on...!'
00260724:'I want to escape so I \ncan think quietly again.'
00260725:'Hey mister! \nStop by the historic old \nDenebola if you're tired! '
00260726:'We're helping our dad. '
00260727:'Come on by the \nhistoric old Denebola \ninn if you're tired.'

00260730:'We get 100 Gald when \nwe help our dad.'
00260731:'Are you tired? \nThen try the historic \nold Denebola inn. <PAGE>We'll take good \ncare of you. '
00260732:'Oh... I'm tired... \nCan you all help me \nbring in some customers?'
00260733:'Stop by the historic \nold Denebola inn! <PAGE>Thanks for coming. \nYou all aren't gonna \nstay at the inn today?'
00260734:'The Denebola is free \nto anyone right now. '
00260735:'If you follow the \nhill up, you'll arrive \nat the Tree of Halure. <PAGE>Of course, it's dead now...'
00260736:'Why did it have to die...?'
00260737:'If you follow the \nhill up, you'll come to \nthe Tree of Halure. <PAGE>It has been restored \nto beautiful life!'
00260738:'Thank you for reviving the Tree.'
00260739:'If you follow the \nhill up, you'll come to \nthe Tree of Halure. <PAGE>Three types of flowers \nbloom on it...oh, do you \nalready know about them?'
00260740:'How can three \ndifferent flowers bloom \non one tree...?'
00260741:'The Tree of Halure is \nnot immortal. The Tree may \none day wither and die. '
00260742:'We're all the same... \nIt seems a little sad \nwhen I put it that way. '
00260743:'I heard that Zaphias\nis in real trouble, \nbut is Halure okay? <PAGE>Did the Commandant of the Knights \ndo something? I didn't think \nhe was...evil...I guess?'
00260744:'I don't think that the \nCommandant of the Knights will \ninvade Zaphias... will he?'
00260745:'These people escaped \nfrom Aspio after that \ntower destroyed it. <PAGE>There's a strange \nfeeling in the air...'
00260746:'The people of this \ntown are all tired for \nno apparent reason. <PAGE>I don't know if I caught \ntheir bug, but I've felt \nreally tired recently...'
00260747:'We have lost everything...<PAGE>But we still live.'
00260748:'As long as we live, \nthere is hope.'
00260749:'Our losses are great, \nbut we will not despair.'
00260750:'Making new discoveries is \nour greatest happiness...'
00260751:'This is the City of \nBlossoms, Halure.'
00260752:'Halure shall remain at \npeace as long as the \nflowers continue to bloom.'
00260753:'Some unknown illness has hit \na lot of people recently.<PAGE>There are no visible \nsymptoms, but it seems to \nmake people tire faster... '
00260754:'Sometimes, I feel \nsick to my stomach. <PAGE>At least I can still get \noutside and walk around. '
00260755:'This is the Krityan \ncity of Myorzo. I'm the \nguard at this gate. <PAGE>Nice to meet you.'

00260758:'Why am I living in a place like \nthis? Well... I guess because that's \nwhat my ancestors decided...?'

00261241:'We really need the \nDon in this town.'
00261242:'Say, did you hear? \nThat cool knight \ngot arrested!'
00261243:'Kind of a shame. \nHe looked so cool...'
00261244:'Barbos made plenty of \ntrouble for this inn, too.'
00261245:'He finally showed \nhis true colors.'
00261246:'The Don himself has stayed \nat this inn. Surely you'd \nlike to stay too?'
00261247:'We still have vacancies! Hurry \nup! First come, first served!'
00261248:'The Don himself has stayed \nat this inn. Surely you'd \nlike to stay too?'
00261249:'We still have vacancies! Hurry \nup! First come, first served!'
00261250:'Wh-why is something \nlike this happening?!'
00261251:'Wh-why is something \nlike this happening?!'
00261252:'The Don instigated the \nattack on Nordopolica?<PAGE>I'm starting to smell \nconflict coming...'
00261253:'Oh, it wasn't the Don? It \nwas his grandson, Harry?<PAGE>What is he thinking? \nWhat a stupid kid.'
00261254:'Hey, you, isn't this \ngetting out of hand?<PAGE>Are they seriously \nthinking of going up \nagainst Nordopolica?'
00261255:'The people of \nPalestralle are tough.<PAGE>What'll we do if \nthey overthrow \nthis town?'
00261256:'The Don... \nThose eyes... \nThey're the eyes of resolution...'
00261257:'The Don... \nI thought this day would \ncome sooner or later...'
00261258:'The poor Don... \nIt's gonna be lonely \naround here.'
00261259:'Our young people will \nreally have to get their \nacts together now.'
00261260:'It sounds like things \ncould get ugly over in \nthe Empire, doesn't it?'
00261261:'Of course, I'd welcome anything\nthat weakened the Empire.'
00261262:'What on earth is going on?'
00261263:'I don't understand \nanything anymore!'
00261264:'A traveler told me \nhe went to Yurzorea.<PAGE>He said he saw Nifil Lake on the \nsouthern side of the continent \nall dried up. What is going on?'
00261265:'I wonder if Nifil Lake, in \nsouthern Yurzorea dried up \nbecause of that monster...'
00261266:'Getting attacked by a huge \npack of monsters right after \narriving, huh... Having fun yet?'
00261267:'Getting attacked by a huge \npack of monsters right after \narriving, huh... Having fun yet?'
00261268:'You say the Empire is coming \nto attack? Well, well. That's \nnot very peaceful at all, is it?'
00261269:'You say the Empire is coming \nto attack? Well, well. That's \nnot very peaceful at all, is it?'
00261270:'That Ragou was quite \na scoundrel, wasn't he?'
00261271:'Just thinking about \nhow he lived so comfortably \nmakes my guts churn.'
00261272:'There's no way \nwe can make nice \nwith the Empire!'
00261273:'It'd be fine if they were \nall as nice as that young \nknight who was here before.'
00261274:'The Don is a great man.'
00261275:'The Don is a great man.'
00261276:'What are monsters \ndoing in the town?! Did \nthe Empire's do this?!'
00261277:'Citizen evacuation has top \npriority! Those who can \nfight, take up your swords!'
00261278:'The only reason we managed to \nget out of that mess with minimum \nlosses is our Union's leadership.'
00261279:'The Don is a great man.'
00261280:'The Empire is supposedly \ngoing to attack. We need \nto tighten up security.'
00261281:'We need to tighten \nup security.'
00261282:'That damn Barbos... \nI'll never forgive him.'
00261283:'I'd never forgive anyone \nwho violated this town.'
00261284:'After Barbos was taken \ncare of, this town got \na lot more peaceful.'
00261285:'I'm just glad Dahngrest is \nback to its good, old self.'
00261286:'If only we could sign a treaty \nof friendship with the Empire,\nwork would be so much simpler.'
00261287:'The day my job gets easy \nis the day we're at peace.'
00261288:'The Empire isn't our only \nenemy! We can't forget \nabout the monsters.'
00261289:'But can anyone really hope\nto defeat that thing...?'
00261290:'Something is giving me \na very bad feeling... \nWhat's going to happen?'
00261291:'For some reason, \nbad feelings always \nseem to come true.'
00261292:'I never even thought \nabout what might happen \nif the Don died.'
00261293:'If we had just done \nour job a little better...'
00261294:'The Don's dead now...\nZaphias can go to \nhell for all I care.'
00261295:'I hope the Empire\nloses its center and \ncompletely collapses.'
00261296:'Hey, you don't think the \nworld's going to be destroyed \nor anything, do you?'
00261297:'Damn! What are we \nsupposed to do about \nthat thing in the sky?'
00261298:'That bastard Harry... \nHe never grows up\ndoes he?<PAGE>The fate of the Union...\nisn't looking good...'
00261299:'Harry's a pretty \ngood worker. <PAGE>But compared to his \ngrandfather, he's just \ngot no backbone.'
00261300:'Hey, you don't think the \nworld's going to be destroyed \nor anything, do you?'
00261301:'Damn! What are we \nsupposed to do about \nthat thing in the sky?'
00261302:'Hey, you don't think the \nworld's going to be destroyed \nor anything, do you?'
00261303:'Damn! What are we \nsupposed to do about \nthat thing in the sky?'
00261304:'Things sure are lively. All thanks \nto the Don and the Union... \nNo no, I'm just talking to myself!'
00261305:'Boss Barbos would have \nmy head if heard me saying \nanything nice about the Don.'
00261306:'This ain't good at all! \nThe smart thing to do \nis make a break for it!'
00261307:'This ain't good at all! \nThe smart thing to do \nis make a break for it!'
00261308:'Well that was a surprise! \nGuess things like this \nreally do happen...'
00261309:'No, no...I didn't run! \nWe fought all proper-like. \nMe too!'
00261310:'They should just hurry \nup and kill all the \nknights they captured!<PAGE>...Wh-what, you got a \nproblem with that...?'
00261311:'...Wh-what, you got \na problem with that...?'
00261312:'Look, it's not \nlike I'm a Barbos\nfan or anything...'
00261313:'S-seriously, I'm not!'
00261314:'With Barbos dead,\nthe Blood Alliance\nis finished...'
00261315:'Jobs are gonna get \nscarce without the Blood \nAlliance around anymore...'
00261316:'We're supposed to be friendly\nwith the Empire now? No way!'
00261317:'What, are we supposed to all \nhold hands with the Knights and \nplay pattycake? What a joke!'
00261318:'This ain't good at all! \nThe smart thing to do \nis make a break for it!'
00261319:'This ain't good at all! \nThe smart thing to do \nis make a break for it!'
00261320:'Just being in this town makes \nme feel like I'm going to get \nwrapped up in something bad.'
00261321:'It might be smart to wait \nfor the right time and just \nget away from this town.'
00261322:'This is bad... I was just \nhanging out, and I got \ncaught up in this mess.<PAGE>What's up with guilds\nfighting each other?!'
00261323:'This is no time to \njust wander around...<PAGE>Ugh...I hate how \nlazy I am...'
00261324:'First Barbos, \nnow the Don?'
00261325:'Just think about it... \nThe heads of two of the five \nmaster guilds are dead.'
00261326:'What's going\nto happen now?'
00261327:'What should I do?'
00261328:'I don't know what to do!'
00261329:'Someone do something!'
00261330:'The air around this town is \nunstable, refracting the sunlight \nand turning the sky red.<PAGE>But no one knows \nwhy the air has \nbeen so unstable.'
00261331:'So now this town is in \na perpetual sunset.<PAGE>It's kind of sad \nand depressing...'
00261332:'The monsters' numbers count \nfor nothing! We shall rout \nthem and drive them back!!'
00261333:'The monsters' numbers count \nfor nothing! We shall rout \nthem and drive them back!!'
00261334:'Those monsters... They looked \nlike the ones I fought in Keiv \nMoc... I wonder why...'
00261335:'......The forest ofKeiv Moc?\nIt's southwest from this town.'
00261336:'First monsters... Now \nthe Empire... \nHow pathetic...'
00261337:'First monsters... Now \nthe Empire... \nHow pathetic...'
00261338:'I have no interest \nin peoples' squabbles.'
00261339:'The chief would say \nthe same thing. \nNo interest at all.'
00261340:'Ragou? \nHmph, I could care \nless about him.<PAGE>So what if a guy like \nthat falls from power? \nI don't feel a thing.'
00261341:'Isn't there a monster out there \nthat can move the heart \nmore than a human?'
00261342:'So... What monsters should \nI go hunting next?'
00261343:'Hmm... Maybe I \nshould rejoin the \nchief and his men.'
00261344:'I gotta hurry and \ntell the chief about \nthat monster.'
00261345:'Monsters are evil.\nThe Hunting Blades\nexist to hunt them.'
00261346:'I hear the chief and \nhis men did quite a \njob in Nordopolica.'
00261347:'Apparently they took out \nall the monsters there.'
00261348:'Whoa, whoa, whoa! The \nDon dies because of some \nwork the bosses did?<PAGE>Isn't that a little \nover-the-top?'
00261349:'You could roast him, burn him, \nfry him up for breakfast... \nThe Don won't die!'
00261350:'I may have no interest in \npeoples' squabbles, but the \ndeath of the Don is heavy...'
00261351:'Maybe I'll go out hunt to \ntake my mind off things.'
00261352:'They say something \nhappened in Zaphias, but it \nhas nothing to do with me.'
00261353:'I guess I'll go fulfill the duty \nof the Hunting Blades.'
00261354:'The monsters are restless. \nI wonder if it's because of \nthe monster in the sky?'
00261355:'Sky, land, whatever. \nI'll take on all the \nvicious monsters.'
00261356:'I'm glad the Don can keep this \nplace lively, but I wish we'd just \ngo take out the Empire already.'
00261357:'Surely Barbos will \nstand against them...'
00261358:'What a great chance \nto show the world \nwhat a guild can do!'
00261359:'If we take care of this before the \nDon gets his chance to show off, \neveryone will know our strength!'
00261360:'Damn the Don\nand his antics!'
00261361:'At this rate we could even \ntake on the Empire...'
00261362:'Now we can finally take on those \nidiots from the Empire. We'll \nshow them a thing or two.'
00261363:'Now we can finally take on those \nidiots from the Empire. We'll \nshow them a thing or two.'
00261364:'Damn it! What do guildsmen\nthink they're doing fighting \nagainst each other?!'
00261365:'The Empire is the enemy!'
00261366:'Heh, so the mighty Don\npasses away... I won't get \nmy share of excitement.'
00261367:'The Don's weak. \nNow Dahngrest's \ngonna get boring.'
00261368:'Who the hell would \nsupport a treaty \nwith the Empire?'
00261369:'The Don is weak.'
00261370:'If Barbos were still alive, \nhe'd take that thing down \nbefore you could blink.'
00261371:'What the hell does the \nDon think he's doing?'
00261372:'I hear Palestralle has \nmade their move.'
00261373:'Heh...things are going \nto get interesting.'
00261374:'All right, now things \nget interesting.<PAGE>How's the Don\ngonna finish this?'
00261375:'I haven't been this \nexcited in a while! \nI'm gonna enjoy this!'
00261376:'I hate the way the \nDon does things. \nThis ain't right.'
00261377:'Damn it! \nWhy are all the \nstrong men dying?'
00261378:'If the Empire tries to muscle in,\nthere's no way the Union as it \nis now can stand up to them.'
00261379:'I wonder how long \nDahngrest will hold...'
00261380:'It's times like this I wish \nthe Don and Barbos\nwere still with us...'
00261381:'I wonder how long \nDahngrest will hold...'
00261382:'Hey! Whaddaya think you're \ndoin' just wanderin' around?'
00261383:'Well?! You got a \nproblem, buddy?!'
00261384:'Th-the barrier broke?! \nThat's impossible!! \nIs the Empire behind this?!'
00261385:'Well?! You got a \nproblem, buddy?!'
00261386:'Hey! Whaddaya think you're \ndoin' just wanderin' around?'
00261387:'Well?! You got a \nproblem, buddy?!'
00261388:'Yo, buddy! \nYou sure you ain't an \nEmpire spy? Huh?!'
00261389:'Well?! You got a \nproblem, buddy?!'
00261390:'The Blood Alliance\nshould just take over \nthe Union already.'
00261391:'And then beat the living \ncrap out of the Empire!'
00261392:'Hey! Whaddaya think you're \ndoin' just wanderin' around?'
00261393:'Well?! You got a \nproblem, buddy?!'
00261394:'A treaty of friendship? \nAre you crazy?'
00261395:'Ain't nobody getting \nfriendly with the Empire.'
00261396:'I'm tough, but that \nthing scares even me.'
00261397:'Not that it would\nbeat me in a fight,\nmind you.'
00261398:'Is it true Belius died?<PAGE>Not that I care \nmuch either way.'
00261399:'Hey, I've got my \nhands full taking \ncare of myself!'
00261400:'All this commotion... \nWhat a pain...<PAGE>What, can he go and do \nanything he wants, just \n'cause he is Don?'
00261401:'Prepared to die? Hah! \nThat's ridiculous. Like \nanyone could do that...'
00261402:'The Don is dead. \nHah hah... I get it. \nI'm dreaming...'
00261403:'I just don't know...'
00261404:'Hey! Whaddaya think you're \ndoin' just wanderin' around?'
00261405:'Well?! You got a \nproblem, buddy?!'
00261406:'Come on, give me a break... \nThis is just crazy.'
00261407:'If nothing else, we gotta \nprotect Dahngrest.'
00261408:'Be careful. \nThe brighter the light, \nthe darker the shadows.'
00261409:'Don't go walking into any alleys. \nDon't whine if you get yourself \nkilled... That's Dahngrest.'
00261410:'Well, well. \nIt's nice the guild\nfolks all fired up.'
00261411:'Monsters aren't my style. \nPeople are.'
00261412:'We take the barriers for granted, \nbut when you think about it \nthey're pretty incredible.'
00261413:'They're so much a part of \nour lives that nobody thinks \ntoo hard about them, but...'
00261414:'Human marks. \nThat's where we come in.'
00261415:'Human marks. \nThat's where we come in.'
00261416:'The Don, or Barbos. \nWonder who I should \nwork for...?'
00261417:'It doesn't really matter, \nas long as I get paid.'
00261418:'If only I could kill Ragou\nwith my own hands.'
00261419:'You'd be surprised how many folks \nthere are that some people wouldn't \nmind seeing disappear...'
00261420:'You say that Ragou's \nas good as free?<PAGE>I swear, everyone and \neverything is rotten. \n...I bet you are too.'
00261421:'Right now, the only people \ninnocent enough to face the \nheavens are small children.'
00261422:'Those monsters are divine \npunishment to humans \nfor the reckless behavior.<PAGE>It's too late to \nregret it now.'
00261423:'Now, for good people \nlike me, it's time to \nget out of here.'
00261424:'I heard Ragou\nturned up dead.<PAGE>The Union put a bounty \non him, but I guess \nsomeone got to him first.'
00261425:'Karma makes the world \ngo 'round, I guess.'
00261426:'Things are bad...<PAGE>But this is my chance \nto make some money...'
00261427:'But I have no obligations \nto the Union.<PAGE>Mercenaries will fight for \nwhoever pays us best.'
00261428:'Hey, what's going on? \nWhat's everyone doing here?<PAGE>A battle with \nPalestralle could start \nany minute, you know.'
00261429:'If you keep just hanging \naround, their people are \ngonna take the town!'
00261430:'In the end, the Don was \njust another person.<PAGE>He was not superhuman. \nHe was not immortal.'
00261431:'There was no \none who could kill \nthat old man after all.<PAGE>The only one who \ncould kill the Don was \nthe Don himself.'
00261432:'I wonder who ended \nup killing Ragou?<PAGE>He was mine. I should \nkill whoever it was \nthat took my prize.'
00261433:'Ragou only got what \nwas coming to him\nsooner or later.'
00261434:'I have no idea what \ncan be done to defeat \nthe evil in this world.'
00261435:'There's no clear \nline between what's \ngood and what's evil.'
00261436:'I don't know what \nthe line is between \ngood and evil.<PAGE>But destroying the world \ncrosses way over that line.'
00261437:'Are you ready \nto take a stand \nagainst evil?'
00261438:'I came here with my \nhusband, but I had no idea \nthis was such a large town.'
00261439:'This place really \nhas a different energy \nthan Zaphias.'
00261440:'Wh-what are the Knights doing? \nTh-they told us to run, but \nwhere are we supposed to go?'
00261441:'Grrr! \nWhere has my idiot of a \nhusband run off to?'
00261442:'That really was something! \nWhat a city! The citizens \ndefend it all by themselves.'
00261443:'And that man, the one \nthey call "the Don"... \nWow...'
00261444:'Wh-what do we do? We'll \nbe in danger if they \nfind out we're nobles!'
00261445:'A-are we going to be okay? \nThey'll beat us up if they \nfind out we're nobles!'
00261446:'I'm so glad the \nmisunderstanding \nhas been cleared up...<PAGE>Now they won't \nbeat us up.'
00261447:'I thought I would \nbe worth more dead \nthan alive.'
00261448:'Things have finally quieted \ndown here... Unlike Zaphias, this \nis quite a down-and-dirty town.'
00261449:'It can be tiring staying \nin an unfamilar place.'

00261456:'A lot of people are gathered \nin the town's main street...<PAGE>Isn't that the Don\nsitting in the middle?'
00261457:'Why is the Don sitting in \nthe middle of the street...?<PAGE>Something's about \nto go down...'
00261458:'Now everyone's \nstrangely quiet... \nI wonder what happened...'
00261459:'It's just one thing after \nanother in this town.'
00261460:'Oh my... Are things all \nright back in Zaphias?'
00261461:'My son and his wife \nare still there...'
00261462:'My son and his wife are still in \nthe capital... I said I wanted to \ngo home, but my husband said no. <PAGE>I know it's dangerous, \nbut still...'

00261464:'A huge tower appeared \ntoward Zaphias, and Aspio\ngot crushed, right?<PAGE>I wonder if Zaphias is \nall right. Scary, scary...'
00261465:'Oh, this is so irritating...! I want \nto go home! I want to go home!\nI want to get back to Zaphias...'
00261466:'I live in this city \nand help out with \nvarious guild jobs.'
00261467:'I love being able to \ninteract with so many \ndifferent people.'
00261468:'I-I have lived in this town \nfor many a year, but I have \nnever seen the barrier fail!!'
00261469:'B-but this town is my \ntown! I-I shall strive to \nprotect it with my life!'
00261470:'I am so pleased the \nbarrier is back in operation! \nNow we can rest easy.'
00261471:'I am so pleased the \nbarrier is back in operation! \nNow we can rest easy.'
00261472:'Of course they're angry here. \nThis town was built by people \nwronged by the Empire.'
00261473:'Of course they're angry here. \nThis town was built by people \nwronged by the Empire.'
00261474:'Fights even happen between \nthe guilds themselves.'
00261475:'Why do people fight...?'
00261476:'Things here in Dahngrest\nare finally back to normal.'
00261477:'I love this city.'

00261481:'Life's not always fun. \nThat is the biggest \ndilemma with living.'
00261482:'Everyone's worried \nthat people will start \nfighting each other again.'
00261483:'Whose blood will flow...? \nHow much this time...?'
00261484:'I knew of no other \nman like the Don.\nIt's such a great loss.'
00261485:'It's such a great loss.\nDon... Rest in peace...'
00261486:'I believe the blastia brought \nabout the catastrophe \nZaphias is facing.'
00261487:'Is the aer going \nout of control? \nWhat's going on?'

00261499:'That Knight dragged people into \njail, and now he's in jail himself...\nBet he's not laughing now.'
00261500:'They went and let \nthat Knight out of jail.'
00261501:'What are they doing, \nslacking at the jail \nat a time like this?'
00261502:'It'd be nice if something \nhappened around here.'
00261503:'I can't stand days \nwith no excitement.'
00261504:'There's no point in \nsigning a treaty! We should \ngo crush the Empire.'
00261505:'To hell with the \nEmpire. We should go \nwipe them off the map.'
00261506:'What the...?! \nWhat is that thing?!'
00261507:'Whoa...! \nOne screw up \nand we're dead.'
00261508:'...Now things are starting \nto get interesting...<PAGE>This is the way \nthe world should be... \nHah hah hah hah...'

00261516:'What the hell is happening?'

00261526:'A guild feud, huh?\nThat's not so bad \nevery now and then.'
00261527:'A guild struggle, huh? \nThat has nothing to do \nwith us Hunting Blades.'
00261528:'Looks like the \nsummons from the \nchief isn't happening yet.'

00261537:'I never thought I'd see the \nDon's final moments \nwith my own eyes.'
00261538:'I hope the Hunting \nBlades are all right.'
00261539:'Tison and I started together. \nWe haven't worked together \nfor a while though...'
00261540:'Monsters are evil. \nBig monsters \nare big evils.<PAGE>We should get rid \nof the big evils \nbefore the little ones.'

00261543:'But it's too big... \nI'm just not feeling this...'
00261544:'You can't rely on anybody \nfrom the Empire.'
00261545:'They don't give a damn \nabout common people. \nStuck up, little...'
00261546:'What?! What's going on?! \nWhy would the barrier fail?'
00261547:'Whoa, whoa, what the \nhell is this? What \nthe hell's going on?'

00261552:'So that piece of crap \nBarbos finally showed \nhis true colors...'
00261553:'Well, everyone already \nknew about that Barbos.'
00261554:'So, I guess peace once \nagain comes to Dahngrest.'
00261555:'The value of peace \ncan only be understood \nby those who know war.'
00261556:'I support the treaty \nof friendship.'
00261557:'We're better off without \nwar, you know?'
00261558:'Whoa, whoa, trouble again? \nWhat the hell's going on?'
00261559:'There's just no end to \nproblems in this world.'
00261560:'You'd have to be \ncrazy to pick a fight \nwith Palestralle.<PAGE>It's dangerous\nto get on their\nbad side...'
00261561:'I don't think just taking \nresponsibility is gonna \nstop things anymore...'
00261562:'You can't move forward \nif you're bound by sadness.'
00261563:'We have to keep everything \nthe Don taught us in our \nhearts, and press on.'
00261564:'We can't grieve one \nman's death forever.<PAGE>Time goes on, and memories fade. \nThat's just the way it is.'
00261565:'All that matters is that we \nkeep feeling the presence \nof the Don in this city.'
00261566:'There's a monster in \nthe sky... I wonder what \nthe Don would do...'
00261567:'If the Don were here... \nNo, the Don isn't \nhere anymore.<PAGE>We have to decide \nfor ourselves.'
00261568:'How embarrassing \nfor Harry. I mean, \nhe's an adult.<PAGE>He was crying \njust now, right?'

00261574:'......'
00261575:'......'
00261576:'W-we'll be fine.\nThe Don will do \nsomething about this.'
00261577:'Th-this town has always \nbeen that way. There's \nnothing to worry about.'
00261578:'See? I was right. \nThe Don took care \nof things.'
00261579:'Th-this town has always \nbeen that way. See? \nNothing to worry about.'
00261580:'The Empire, the Knights... \nNobody in this town \ntrusts them at all.'
00261581:'The Imperial Council and the Knights \nwouldn't stand a chance if the guilds\nbanded together to take them on.'
00261582:'Curse that Barbos! \nHe's disgraced the guilds!'
00261583:'This isn't any time \nfor the guilds to \nbe fighting!'
00261584:'Guess things got \nwrapped up nicely.'
00261585:'That Ragou guy \ngot away, though...'
00261586:'I respect the Don, but \nI'm not big on the idea \nof a friendship treaty.'
00261587:'I can't believe the \nDon would sign a treaty \nwith the Empire...<PAGE>Wait, this is the Don. \nCould it be to throw \nthe Empire off guard?'
00261588:'What the hell is that?!'
00261589:'I never seen anything \nlike that, much less \neaten anything like it!'
00261590:'The fun never \nends in this town.<PAGE>But I guess Dahngrest\nwouldn't be Dahngrest\nif it were quiet.'
00261591:'Of course, that's exactly \nwhy I like Dahngrest.<PAGE>It'd be missing something \nif it were just some \nquiet, sleepy town.'
00261592:'I get the feeling the old \nera is ending, and a new \none is about to begin.'
00261593:'It's so exciting to \nlive in times of change.'
00261594:'What's going to \nhappen now?'
00261595:'My uneasiness is \nlike a dark cloud \nmoving into my heart.'
00261596:'We have to protect this \ntown ourselves. We don't \nhave anyone else to rely on.'
00261597:'This is the time for all guilds\nto pull their strength together.'
00261598:'Is it imprudent of me \nto think that this state \nof the world is...fun?'
00261599:'People are coming together \nnow. Even if the world came \nto an end now, I'd die happy.'
00261600:'My mommy's a guild\nbigshot! Really! \nI even met the Don!'
00261601:'The Don's an even \nbigger bigshot! Not just \nanybody can meet him.'
00261602:'Waaah, waaah...'
00261603:'Mommy! Mommy! \nWhere are you?!'
00261604:'My mommy fought, too! I'm \ngonna be a guild when \nI grow up, just like her!'
00261605:'When I grow up, I'm \ngonna be a guild!\n...Be a...guild?'
00261606:'Even if the Empire attacks, \nthe Don'll beat them up good!'
00261607:'Even if the Empire attacks, \nI'm going to help the Don\nfight them!'
00261608:'Mommy says someone called \nBarbos is the bad guy.'
00261609:'Don't you wish \nbad guys would all \njust go away?'
00261610:'We're back at peace! \nThat's what my mommy said.'
00261611:'Even the neighbors \nwere saying that \npeace is best.'
00261612:'Now we're gonna be \nfriends with the Empire?'
00261613:'I guess being \nfriends is nice.'
00261614:'Waaah, waaah...'
00261615:'Mommy! Mommy! \nWhere are you?!'
00261616:'Mommy says something's \ngonna happen.'
00261617:'They say something's gonna \nhappen, but what? A party?'
00261618:'It sure is crazy out there. \nFancy a drink before you go?'
00261619:'I wanna go see what's \ngoing on out there, but \nI got customers to serve.'
00261620:'It sure is crazy out there. \nFancy a drink before you go?'
00261621:'I wanna go see what's \ngoing on out there, but \nI got customers to serve.'
00261622:'We got anything you want.\nFancy a drink before you go?'
00261623:'Zaphias Brew, Ehmead Snow, Dese \nDraft... They're good drinks \nthat do down like water.'
00261624:'We'll hold a banquet \nhere when the friendship \ntreaty is signed.'
00261625:'I'll bring out the really good \nbooze when that happens!'
00261626:'What was that noise? Another \nmonster? If you need another \nhand, I have one to lend.'
00261627:'Even if it means I have to use \nan empty bottle as a weapon, \nI'll do it to protect this town.'
00261628:'The customers have a lot \nto complain about lately.<PAGE>I know what that's like.'
00261629:'But it's part of \nmy job to listen,\nso I can't join in.'
00261630:'Careful not to drown your \ncares in too much drink. You'll \njust make yourself sick.'
00261631:'The Don was quite \na drinker, you know.\nHe came by often.'
00261632:'Fancy a drink before you go?'
00261633:'What do you like? \nCocktails? Wine? Whiskey?<PAGE>Or maybe rain water is good \nenough for you? We also have hot \nmiso soup, if that's your fancy.'
00261634:'Many customers come here\nas an escape from reality.<PAGE>Personal relationships\nin the guilds can be\npretty stressful.'
00261635:'Even I work here\nto escape from reality.'
00261636:'Have any troubles \nyou want to unload?\nI'll listen to anything.<PAGE>I am the bartender \nhere, after all.'
00261637:'I'm the bartender, \nnot the bar or a bender. \nThe bartender!'
00261638:'Hmph... I can't even drink in \npeace and quiet in this town.'
00261639:'Seriously, what is all \nthe commotion about?'
00261640:'Barbos... That's the chief \nof the Blood Alliance, right?'
00261641:'I hear that guy\nhas some skill.'
00261642:'So Barbos is gone, huh?'
00261643:'People dying... \nThat's exactly how \ntimes change.'
00261644:'Someone long ago once told me\nthat work is what you make of it.<PAGE>If I have to make it,\nthen I'd rather not bother.'
00261645:'...Isn't there any work?'
00261646:'What? A monster \nconvered in flames?\nYou drunk?'
00261647:'Yeah, I'm drunk, \nbut I ain't about to say \nanything stupid like you.'
00261648:'I'm just a mercenary. \nWhat was I thinking, helping \nto repair that bridge?<PAGE>Well, I guess it would \nbe pretty inconvenient \nwithout a bridge.'
00261649:'Now that the bridge is fixed, \nthey're having me figure out \nthe costs of the repairs.<PAGE>I'm telling you, this \nis not part of my job.'
00261650:'The Don was \nthe Don, right \nto the end.'
00261651:'I've never met any other man\nlike the Don in my whole life.'
00261652:'There's trouble in the Empire? \n Well, that news makes my day.'
00261653:'There's trouble in the Empire? \nWell, that's nothing new.'
00261654:'Things are so bad lately \nI can't even get by \nwithout a drink.'
00261655:'Ooooh... *Hic!*'
00261656:'Nothing is solved by \ndrinking. I know that.<PAGE>But I can't get by \nwithout my alcohol.'
00261657:'*Hic!* I can't believe I'm \ndrunk after 10 iced teas...'
00261658:'I ain't drunk!'
00261659:'I'm tellin' ya, I ain't drunk!'
00261660:'I ain't drunk!'

00261677:'Huh? No, I'm not drunk.'
00261678:'This is a fine drink. \nFortune's Market sure knows \nhow to pick the right stuff.'
00261679:'When business is good,\ndrinking is that much more fun.'
00261680:'I make my own way no matter how \ncrazy things get. That's how you do \nthings when you're part of a guild.'
00261681:'It's a disgrace for a guildsman\nto get caught up in every new \ntrend that comes along.'
00261682:'I come here every day...\nI wonder if I'm living a decent life...'
00261683:'I know my tab \nis getting up there...<PAGE>What's even scarier is no one's \npressuring me to pay...'
00261684:'I haven't done \nany real work lately.'
00261685:'Guess it doesn't matter.'
00261686:'Monsters, you say? \nWhere are your manners? \nCan't you see I'm drinking?<PAGE>Ask someone else \nwho has the time.'
00261687:'These guys drink all day. \nIf you need a favor, ask around \nfor someone with nothing to do.'
00261688:'I hear someone let slip \nthat Leviathan's Claw\nis making a move.<PAGE>I guess it's tough\neverywhere you go.'
00261689:'Nothing good ever \ncomes when Leviathan's \nClaw makes a move.'
00261690:'There are times when \nyou just want to drink and \nforget about everything.'
00261691:'Sometimes you just can't get \nanything done. I'm just biding \nmy time until I can do something.'
00261692:'Drinks can fool even \nterminal illnesses.'
00261693:'Alcohol is the cure for everything.\nBut don't go drinking too much.'
00261694:'I want to do something \nbefore I really regret it.'
00261695:'But I just can't pry \nmy hands off this bottle...'
00261696:'I heard there's a sword style \ncalled Drunken Sword. It lets \nyou fight even while drinking.<PAGE>I want to learn it.'
00261697:'If I could master Drunken Sword, \nI could work while I drink...'
00261698:'This is where we mercenaries \nscout for work.'
00261699:'Don't bother me.'
00261700:'Thanks to Barbos, attitudes \ntowards us mercenaries\nhave gotten pretty cold.'
00261701:'I'm may be a mercenary, \nbut I'm not part of the \nBlood Alliance...'
00261702:'I'm scrambling every day\nto regain the trust of\nthe tarnished mercenaries.<PAGE>Damn it, it's all \nBarbos's fault.'
00261703:'How hard do I have to work\nto regain that trust...?'

00261707:'If you want that thing dead,\ntry barking up another guild.'
00261708:'More resistance among \nthe guilds? It better not be \nanother mercenary guild.'
00261709:'Any more bad reflections \non the mercenaries, and \nwe'll seriously be out of work.'
00261710:'The more chaos befalls the \nworld, the more the mercenary \nbusiness flourishes.<PAGE>Even so, it is forbidden for us \nto create conflicts ourselves.'
00261711:'Trust is number one in the guild business.\nIf you're caught cheating the system,\nyou'll be banished from the industry.'
00261712:'I bet I could find plenty of jobs\nin Zaphias right now.'
00261713:'Of course, that's only \nif I could make it there.'
00261714:'My sword is no match for that \nnasty monster in the sky.<PAGE>I don't think there's \nany other sword who can \ntake it down either...'

00261718:'Don't talk to me \nor you'll get hurt.'

00262119:'There's no way \nthe monsters could \nbring it down, right?'
00262120:'They say someone tampered \nwith the barrier blastia.'
00262121:'We'll have to put the barrier \nblastia under much heavier \nguard from now on.'
00262122:'Even our mighty barrier \nwon't protect us against \nthe Imperial Knights.'
00262123:'If only we had a barrier \nthat worked against people.'

00262132:'The barrier failure, the monsters \nattacking... So much for the \nfairytale about barrier safety.<PAGE>Sure, we're safer with it, \nbut it's no guarantee.'
00262133:'Even the peace we have right now\nis only a temporary thing.'
00262134:'Barriers protect us from monsters, \nbut they can't protect us from \nthe evil of other humans.<PAGE>The Don protected \nus from that.'

00262146:'Such a fuss over one or \ntwo barriers going bad.'

00262148:'No matter how much the \nEmpire may struggle, they're \nno match for the Don.'
00262149:'He's the strongest man I \nknow. Next to me, of course.'
00262150:'Barbos doesn't know \nhis place.'
00262151:'What he needs is a lesson. \nAnd I'll smack some \nlearning into his head!'
00262152:'People from the Empire\nhave begun to show \ntheir faces around here.'

00262164:'If only I were twenty \nyears younger... I'd take \nthat monster out quick.'
00262165:'Ohh, my back...'

00262169:'Out of the way!\nOut of the way!'
00262170:'I'm just here for a visit, \nand the barrier disappears! \nTalk about bad luck...'
00262171:'I'm just really unlucky. \nYeah, really unlucky.'
00262172:'The barrier was fixed... \nNow I can breathe a \nsigh of relief.'
00262173:'I can have a good \ndrink here. Maybe my \nluck has turned a little.'
00262174:'Sometimes the solidarity \nof the guilds\ncan \nbe a painful thing.'
00262175:'People with conviction \nwho get bound up by rules \ncan often do crazy things.'
00262176:'Barbos is only doing \nwhat he thinks is right.'
00262177:'Don't like it? \nYour only choice is to resist \nwith a show of force.'
00262178:'It's so nice to enjoy a \ngood meal while listening \nto this beautiful music.'
00262179:'Hey, why don't you take \nit easy and enjoy a nice \nmeal once in a while?'
00262180:'It's so nice to enjoy a \ngood meal while listening \nto this beautiful music.'
00262181:'Hey, why don't you take \nit easy and enjoy a nice \nmeal once in a while?'
00262182:'That monster in \nflames seems like it's \nlooking for something.'
00262183:'Do you think it has some \nkind of intelligence?\nNo, that's impossible.'
00262184:'There's going to be a lot \nof casualties if it comes to \nfacing Palestralle head-on.'
00262185:'Belius, from Palestralle, \nis just as important to \nthe guilds as the Don is.'
00262186:'Belius and the Don... \nEveryone knew and respected them,\nand now, one after the other...'
00262187:'They say Leviathan's Claw\nis pulling the strings.'
00262188:'The kindling that started \nin the Empire looks like it \nwill spread to the world.<PAGE>It's times like these that try \nthe unity of the guilds.'

00262201:'What would be best is \nif it all ended while \nI'm thinking about it.'

00262203:'I'll just drink and \nsleep well tonight.'
00262204:'I hear the Knights \ndefeated Barbos.<PAGE>I'm a little disappointed \nI didn't get a chance to \nshow my true strength.'

00262209:'Is that huge monster \nstill out there?'
00262210:'So the Imperial Knights used \ntheir hoplon blastia to chase \nthat huge monster away.<PAGE>I'm disappointed that I \ncouldn't use my strength \nto chase it away myself.'
00262211:'I failed to seize \nthe opportunity to show \nmy true strength.<PAGE>What? Palestralle? \nTh-that's out of \nmy league...'

00262579:'Resting your weary bodies \nhere after the long journey \nwould be a fine idea.<PAGE>Hmm? The sky? Hah hah hah! \nWorrying won't change anything! \nI just won't think about it.'

00262581:'Why not have a rest \nhere before you leave? '
00262582:'The desert's scorching, but the \ntown's nice and cool. We're doing all \nwe can to preserve the peace here.'
00262583:'Please let us know if you have \nany trouble. Captain <STR>(FRE)\nhas told us to listen well.'

00262585:'With the Empire unstable, we \nmust be resolute! We must not \nlet the citizens fall to despair!'
00262586:'I-is that a monster? H-how \nare we supposed to defend the town \nfrom something like that...?<PAGE>W-wait, what \nam I saying?!<PAGE>I can't panic... That would \nonly worry the people. \nWe must hold fast!'
00262587:'I'm fine, I'm really fine... \nI'm not scared... I'm \nnot scared at all...'
00262588:'I-is that thing in the sky \ngonna attack or what? I wish \nit would make up its mind!'

00262590:'I saw something that looked \nlike a massive bird in the \nsky before we came here.<PAGE>I asked around, but I was the \nonly person in the brigade who \nsaw it. Nobody believed me.'

00262596:'You know that new town \neveryone's talking about? \nI hear it floats in the sky.<PAGE>...That's gotta be a lie. \nWhoever made that story up... \nThat's a real bigmouth.'
00262597:'But if it were true... Floating \ncities? And that huge monster? \nIt's the end of the world.'
00262598:'It seems that \nCaptain Cumore\nwasn't a real magistrate.<PAGE>He didn't want us to find \nout, so he prohibited the \nresidents from going out.'
00262599:'But I'm glad he wasn't a real \nmagistrate. If he was, we wouldn't \nbe able to run him out of town. '
00262600:'The Knights in town \nare quite different from the \nones that were here before!<PAGE>I guess this is the way \ngenuine knights behave. \nThey're so dependable. '
00262601:'Their captain, too... I only saw him \nfor a second, but he was so handsome! \nHe seems like a wonderful guy.∀'
00262602:'Say, do you know about the hole \nback behind the inn? There's \nsomething...strange in it...<PAGE>What could it be? \nIt's kind of scary...'
00262603:'You people should probably \nstay away from it. '
00262604:'I heard the castle\nin Zaphias was \ndestroyed recently...<PAGE>What's with all \nthe strange things \nhappening lately? '
00262605:'The knights in the <STR>(FRE)\nBrigade will protect this \ntown. Everything's fine.<PAGE>We have our barrier, too. '
00262606:'You know that city floating in \nthe sky? I wonder if it was on the \nground, and then just took off!<PAGE>This town isn't going to go, \n"Fwoop!" and sail off into the \nsky too some day, is it?'
00262607:'What are we going \nto do if this town \nstarts floating...?<PAGE>We won't be able to import \nfood from other towns anymore. \nI hope we don't starve.'
00262608:'Whew... I can finally get out of \nthe house and walk around. I thought \nI'd never see the sun again...<PAGE>This is all thanks \nto that young \nKnight, <STR>(FRE).'
00262609:'The Knight who was here \nbefore... Cu-something? \nHe was terrible.<PAGE>Where did he run off to? \nI'd wager he got caught \nand thrown in jail. '
00262610:'The town is finally free again, \nbut now there's all this hubbub \nabout giant birds and the Empire.<PAGE>Everyone's in such a fuss. People \nshould take things easy, like me. \nOtherwise, life'll tire you out.'
00262611:'Honestly, I'm more afraid \nof my wife's scoldings. '
00262612:'*Fgggh...grph...grrph... \nfthrrrp...gggh*'
00262613:'Oh my, I forgot to \nput in my dentures! \nHah hah hah.'
00262614:'All the brouhaha lately \nhas some folk saying \nit's the end of the world.<PAGE>Foolishness. Do they really \nthink the world's going \nto end that easily?'
00262615:'It seems like the younger \npeople are, the gloomier they \nare... Kids, I swear...'
00262616:'I'm just thankful to be free, \nI guess. You only miss \nsomething once you lose it...<PAGE>We've all got the \nknights of the <STR>(FRE)\nBrigade to thank for that.'
00262617:'Now we'll be able to \nlive without worrying. '
00262618:'That giant bird... \nI bet its droppings \nare simply nasty.<PAGE>Oh dear. Excuse me \nfor saying something \nso indelicate.'
00262619:'Oh no! Now that I have \nthat thought in my head! \nI can't shake it... '

00262621:'Oh, I know what's next. \nThe sun's going to split \ninto three, or something. '
00262622:'Goodness gracious. \nThe right answer was a \ncity being built in the sky.<PAGE>I was so sure it'd be \nthree suns after that \ngiant flying monster...'
00262623:'I guess it doesn't really matter. \nIt's not a quiz, after all. '

00262625:'He must've been \nscared of me. \nHah hah hah!'
00262626:'Owww... My old lady \nreally went to work \non me again.<PAGE>All I did was stay out 'til \ndawn three days in a row... \nIs that so bad...?'

00262633:'I heard some horror stories \nabout the Knights here, but they \ndon't seem to be a problem now. '
00262634:'Apparently a large number of \ntroops came here a while ago, \nand then left quickly.<PAGE>Whatever could have happened?'

00262878:'Of course, <STR>(FRE) can't hold \na candle to Captain Cumore.<PAGE>I am quite sure he's the \nstrongest knight of all.'
00262879:'Whenever will the new \nEmperor be appointed?<PAGE>If only a successor could \nbe decided, it would surely \nhelp to quell this chaos.'
00262880:'I would be quite happy with His Royal \nHighness Ioder, or even someone else. \nWe need a new Emperor soon...'
00262881:'I was surprised with that \ntower, but it's okay. <PAGE>That's because we \nhave a barrier. '
00262882:'As long as we have \nthe Empire and barriers, \nthis world is secure. <PAGE>I feel sorry for lower \nclass citizens who do not \nbelieve in the Empire. '
00262883:'Things seem to be quite clamorous \noutside town, but within the barrier, \nit's rather peaceful.<PAGE>Of course, the low-born folk are \npanicking, as is their wont.'
00262884:'We have a barrier. No \nmatter what happens, \nwe will be safe.'

00262886:'On rainy days, Rhybgaros are \nwandering outside the barriers. <PAGE>They seem to \nappear in wooded \nareas. '

00262891:'What a magnificent view.<PAGE>Looking upon such a sight, \none forgets all their bothersome, \ndaily cares.'

00262913:'Alright, the sky is clearing. \nI can take my boat out. <PAGE>I hope I don't interrupt \nthe magistrate... '
00262914:'I can take my boat out when \nthe magistrate is gone...! <PAGE>I'm sure that I'll \nbe killed if I send \na message...!'
00262915:'Finally, the port's been reopened! \nNow we can set sail. First stop, \nCapua Torim.'
00262916:'"The ocean is the domain \nof lusty men... Seaways \nthe roads we travel..."'
00262917:'The atmosphere here is nice \nenough, but the town itself \nis sort of irritating.<PAGE>This must be the influence \nof that magistrate's rule.'
00262918:'"Bound by brotherhood, the men of the \nsea set sail... Upon oceans fine, \nwith wind warm and sun bright..."'
00262919:'Our ship is going to \nbe heading south, with \nrefugees onboard.<PAGE>I'm not entirely sure what our ports \nof call will be, but there's an entire \ncontinent down there, right?'

00262922:'"Ring, o ring on the sea! \nSay your vows to the..." \nAh, hell. This is no time for singing.'
00262923:'Just when I thought I was getting used \nto a giant ring floating on the sea, \nthat thing showed up in the sky.<PAGE>What in the world's \ngoing on?'
00262924:'I'm not in a jaunty enough \nmood to sing today. *Sigh* \nIt's sad, isn't it?'
00262925:'I don't know what I could have \ndone, but compared to how scary \nthe ocean is, this is nothing. <PAGE>It's not as if the boat \nis going to overturn. '
00262926:'Oh, I'm a man of the sea... I'm \nnot scared of landslides, but \ntidal waves are scary... <PAGE>I stirring up my heart \nby singing...!'
00262927:'Have you seen the notice board? \nThere's a new wanted man!<PAGE>It says he has long black \nhair, kind of like you!'
00262928:'When I finally thought it would \nclear up, it's now this. <PAGE>This is scary, real scary. There's a lot of \nthings in this world that frighten me. '
00262929:'Hmm? There's a reward \nposted for Lord Ragou... <PAGE>"Ex-magistrate Ragou, \nWhereabouts Unknown! Reward For \nInformation: 2000 Gald", it says.'
00262930:'Ohh, how frightening. \nDo you think he \nwas kidnapped?'
00262931:'This one says, "Don Whitehorse Dead! \nWho Will Be His Successor?"<PAGE>If the relationship between the guilds \nand the Empire gets worse, this town \nwill be the first to feel the effects.'
00262932:'Ohh, how frightening. There'll be \na war of succession. It's almost \ntoo frightening to think about!'
00262933:'"Giant Insect Blastia \nRampages From East To West!", \nsays this one. <PAGE>I wonder if that \nwas what I saw out \non the sea...?'
00262934:'Ohh, how frightening. Just think about how \nutterly squashed you'd be if something \nlike that stepped on you. How terrible!'
00262935:'There were people shouting, \n"Martial Law in Zaphias! \nCitizens Flee to Capua." <PAGE>I have no idea what \nthey're talking about.'
00262936:'Ohh, how frightening. Just think about \nhow many scary people there are \nout there. It's simply horrible!'
00262937:'"Ancient Relic Of The Past?! \nA Giant Palace Appears In The \nInland Sea!", this one reads.<PAGE>Do you think the ancients \nlived beneath the sea...?'
00262938:'Ohh, how frightening. I hope they don't \ndiscover a bunch of dead bodies there. \nNothing could be scarier than that!'
00262939:'What was that sound? \nI'm worried. <PAGE>I wish they would post news on \nthe bulletin board quicker...'
00262940:'I'm always here \nwaiting for the \nlatest news. <PAGE>I'm all a-twitter...'
00262941:'"The Monster In The \nSky: Angel Or Demon?!", \nit says.<PAGE>How could that thing possibly \nlook like an angel to anybody?!'
00262942:'Ohh, how frightening. I'm starting \nto think there isn't anything in \nthis world that ISN'T scary!'
00262943:'Clear skies are \nthe best♪ <PAGE>A bright sun and blue ocean \nare a match for this city!'
00262944:'Welcome, welcome! City of the \nsurf and sun. City of the blue \nocean and ship's horn. <PAGE>This is Capua \nNor.'
00262945:'Originally, this was one city \nmade up of Nor, Torim, and \nDuo, built on the ocean.<PAGE>I suppose it's been more than \na hundred years since Duo \nsank to the bottom of the sea...'
00262946:'You can probably see \nit from the piers.<PAGE>See what? The bridge that once \nconnected Capua, Torim and Duo.'
00262947:'This town owes its prosperity to the \nregular liners and trading ships.<PAGE>Of course, Ragou's control was \nmore than enough to strip this \ntown of all its vitality.'
00262948:'Once a town loses its vitality, I'd wager it's \nan almost impossible task to get it back.'
00262949:'The capital's in an \nuproar and people are \nleaving in droves.<PAGE>Some are crossing over Ehmead \nHill and coming here.'
00262950:'First, the chaos in the \ncapital, now an explosion \non Ehmead Hill. <PAGE>I heard some people were \ncaught in that explosion.'
00262951:'I heard they somehow repaired the barrier \nback in Zaphias, but I'm sure they're \nnot taking any chances. <PAGE>We can't, either. We have \nto prepare our town for anything \nthat might happen...'
00262952:'It seems researchers come from \nAspio now and again to perform \nmaintenance on our blastia. <PAGE>Even so, it's pure foolish \nto have blind faith that \neverything will be all right.'
00262953:'There have been a lot of small temblors \nlately. It's strange... The land \nhere is historically very stable.'
00262954:'We can't ignore these earthquakes any \nlonger. Might they have something to \ndo with the monster in the sky...?'
00262955:'Aspio was right beneath where that \ntower sprang up. If I had to guess, \nI'd say it was razed to the ground.<PAGE>Who's going to do our \nblastia maintenance now...?'
00262956:'At any rate, it certainly was huge. \nI wouldn't be surprised if the entire \ncontinent of Ilyccia sank...'
00262957:'Hey. You didn't find \nany Rhybgaros? <PAGE>Wait, you did? Then \nwhere are they?'
00262958:'Don't lie. You \ndidn't find any. '
00262959:'Have you seen the new magistrate \nyet? He's a young man with fair \nskin, and he seems really kind.<PAGE>Of course, I thought the old magistrate \nseemed like a nice old man \nwhen I first saw him, too.'
00262960:'Absolute power \ncorrupts absolutely.<PAGE>...That's what the knight with \nbristly green hair wearing \na mask was saying, anyway.'
00262961:'There are more Rhybgaros \nlike the one brought over \nby the previous magistrate.'
00262962:'"If you mix foreign animals \nin an area, this disrupts \nthe local ecosystem."<PAGE>...At least, that's what the \ntied blue-hair, cool, bad-mouthed \nstudent said... '
00262963:'I wonder if "aer" has anything \nto do with the freezing \nof the Northern Sea. <PAGE>Do you know whether the \ndrift ice of frozen \nsea water is salty?'
00262964:'Our very lives depend on \nthe existence of "aer". \nWe should be thankful.<PAGE>...That's what the pink-haired, \nKritya-looking girl carrying \na broom said, anyway.'
00262965:'There are more Rhybgaros \nlike the one brought over \nby the previous magistrate.'
00262966:'"If you mix foreign animals \nin an area, this disrupts \nthe local ecosystem."<PAGE>...At least, that's what the \ntied blue-hair, cool, bad-mouthed \nstudent said... '
00262967:'Everyone's talking about the end \nof the world lately, but...<PAGE>...Just look at how big the \nworld is! Do you think it's \nreally going to end so fast?'
00262968:'Even if the world should be coming\nto an end, we can still fight as long\nas we never lose hope.<PAGE>That's what the guy with spiky\nblonde hair who was calling himself\na hero was saying, anyway.'
00262969:'I'm surprised!\nI didn't think that a tower\nwould come out from there.<PAGE>I wonder who made that.'
00262970:'How could I be scared? It's an \nancient mystery and something \nthat looks like a daffodil. <PAGE>That's what the silver-haired, \nloud-mouthed, female \nteacher said. '
00262971:'Have you gone and climbed the tower that \ncame out of the northern mountains yet?<PAGE>It looks like it's made from \na whole bunch of other buildings \nstanding together.'
00262972:'I think the ancient city only looks like \na tower from a distance because of how \nthe buildings stand close together.<PAGE>...That's what the cool swordsman \nwearing a bone on his head \nwas saying, anyway.'
00262973:'I hate rain. However, \nI hate clear skies \neven more. <PAGE>It's so pretty and smells \nof lies that it makes \nme want to vomit. '
00262974:'Although there are people who complain \nto the magistrate, it's their \nfault for not having any money.'
00262975:'Barbos from the mercenary \nguild and Ragou from the \nEmpire were the same. <PAGE>People with power do whatever they \nwant, and then they die. Trying to \nlive an honest life is pointless.'
00262976:'Course, I'll never become like \neither of those guys no matter \nhow much I might struggle.'
00262977:'I tell you... This is one mean world... \nHeh, I guess that's not much of \na welcome. Anyway, wanna stay?<PAGE>It's 300 Gald a night.'

00263002:'A golden light in the forest south \nof Nor Harbor. Please. \nThat's just a rumor among the poor. <PAGE>I guess everyone \nlikes talking \nabout gold. '
00263003:'A golden light moving at high \nspeed in the south forest must \nbe someone's delusion. '

00263008:'Heh heh heh. If they won't \nlet me take a boat out, I'll \njust buy off the helmsman.<PAGE>What, surely a billion \nGald would be enough?'
00263009:'A billion Gald will put a tiny \ndent in my wallet, but I may \nhave no choice! Tee-hee.'
00263010:'It seems it doesn't matter how much money \nI have, no ships are leaving and that's \nthat.

00263011:'It's the unexpected that makes travel \nso rewarding. If you think about it like \nthat, it's really quite wonderful.<PAGE>Under normal cirumstances I'd never be staying \nin such accommodations, but now I might \neven start feeling attached to it.<PAGE>Don't you agree? You must, \notherwise you wouldn't have \nset foot inside this inn.'
00263012:'I think the magistrate, Ragou, \nmet with great misfortune.<PAGE>He was only collecting monsters to practice \nthose elegant hobbies of his.<PAGE>They may have been eccentric hobbies, but \nhe was only exercising his special privileges. \nDon't you think that's charmingly grandiose?'
00263013:'Can you even believe it? What has he done? \nRagou was branded an evildoer for nothing \nmore than wielding his magistratear rights.<PAGE>I really feel for this town's \nmagistrate, I really do.<PAGE>You do too, yes? Yes? \nNo? Of course you \ndo. You must.'
00263014:'All the people here are up in arms about \nthe head of the Guilds passing away.<PAGE>This Empire doesn't even have \na sitting Emperor...could things \npossibly get any worse?<PAGE>I don't have any problem with lauding the \nachievements of those that were lost, \nbut there's no point grieving for them.'

00263675:'The sky? I don't have any time to think \nabout it! My life is on the line, here!'
00263676:'I lost...I lost...what's \nwrong with this \ntipster?<PAGE>I...I haven't been \ncheated, have I?'
00263677:'I suppose I should be thankful \nI still have my life...'
00263678:'This tipster here, Itoken...he once \npicked a dark horse that won against \nhundred thousand-to-one odds.<PAGE>I reckoned I didn't have anything to \nlose, so I followed his tip. I never \nimagined it would pay out so well.'
00263679:'That bet netted me an almost \nunthinkable amount of Gald. \nIt was like paradise...<PAGE>Yet ever since then, neither Itoken \nnor I have picked any winners. Now all \nI have left to my name is debt...'
00263680:'Itoken has quite the silver tongue. He \nmanages to convince himself his predictions \nare sound even when they fail.<PAGE>I must be a generous man...I \nfall for his smart talk \nagain and again.'
00263681:'This noble lady beside me is \nplacing quite a large bet...perhaps \nI will as well.<PAGE>How lucky I'd be if this paid off \nand I was able to get out of debt.'
00263682:'Itoken fingered a dark horse worth \nfive hundred thousand...!<PAGE>What an old fool I am! Why \nnow, of all times, did I decide \nto get cold feet...'
00263683:'The noble lady beside \nme won big...<PAGE>Surely she could spare \na few Gald now...'
00263684:'Itoken's tips never \npan out, do they?<PAGE>It's incredible he's able to stay \nin business with nothing but talk.'
00263685:'Why do I even keep \non buying Itoken's \ntips...?'
00263686:'What a dupe...this noble lady \njust bet her entire fortune \non one of Itoken's tips.<PAGE>I suppose that's just the pot \ncalling the kettle black...'
00263687:'Poor Belius has died...this \nis no time to \nbe gambling...<PAGE>But I can't stop. \nIt's an addiction.'
00263688:'He's never right...this so-called tipster \nis nothing but a clump of bad luck.<PAGE>Even so, his business is booming. \nHow nice it must be to be ignorant.'
00263689:'Hey...when you think about it, he's \nnot losing a single Gald, is he?<PAGE>His tips aren't worth a whit and he \nkeeps on squeezing money out of us!'
00263690:'I don't know how much longer I have left \nto live. If I can just win one more \nbet, have one final good memory...<PAGE>But still, I lose. Does \nthis cruel tipster even \ncare about my feelings?'
00263691:'The end is nigh...if we're all going \nto be destroyed anyway, perhaps \nbankruptcy isn't so bad...'
00263692:'This is my first time at the coliseum. \nEverything was so shocking, and \nI got a bit too excited...<PAGE>Now I'm just taking in a little \nsea breeze to calm myself down.'
00263693:'Whew...my heart is still \npounding. Here, touch \nmy chest and see.<PAGE>Hey, I'm just kidding, \nyou know.♪'
00263694:'That's the Coliseum City \nfor you! I can see \nfights every day! <PAGE>It's wonderful! \nJust wonderful!'
00263695:'Can I see a bit \nmore blood...?<PAGE>I lied, \nI’m just kidding!'
00263696:'What’s happened!? \nAn old man wearing explorer’s \nclothes ran out of the town.<PAGE>What’s that!? Trouble you say? \nAh, I’m so excited! '
00263697:'Great, that’s what I love about this town!<PAGE>There’s cheating everyday...<PAGE>Ahhh, I mean...Picking?...\nnot learning...\nhiking...?'
00263698:'The crowd was going crazy a \nlittle while ago. You could \neven hear screams of pain.<PAGE>I wish I had been there to see \nit. The louder the screams, \nthe more exciting it is...'
00263699:'Bloody flesh...blackened bones...shredded \nskin...scattered entrails...it's \nall so thrilling.<PAGE>Hey, I'm just kidding! I sure \nhave a sick mind, huh?♪'
00263700:'All the matches are so boring \nlately. It's always the \nsame old fighters.<PAGE>You're already here in \nNordopolica. How about \nyou step in the ring?'
00263701:'Of course, you'll just lose \nand die a dog's death.<PAGE>Tee-hee, I'm just kidding! \nWhat a big mouth I have.♪'
00263702:'If they're going to have such big, \nexciting matches, why don't they \nadvertise them beforehand?<PAGE>They just held an event with people against \ngiant monsters. And it was a walk-in!'
00263703:'Look, we came all the way here. \nThat's the kind of ridiculous \nthing we want to see, right?'
00263704:'Ooh, I just had a great idea. \nWhy not pit knights against \nguildsmen in the coliseum?<PAGE>Now, wouldn't that be exciting?∀'
00263705:'Howls of anguish! Brother against brother! \nShowers of blood! The mad roar of \nthe crowd... Oh, how wonderful!<PAGE>I'm kidding! \nI'm kidding!♪'
00263706:'Say, that monster in \nthe sky...what is it?<PAGE>It's so new and exciting...even if it \nis the kind of monster that attacks \npeople, I'd love to see it up close...'
00263707:'It’s first victim will be little...old...me!∀ \nAh, the martyrdom of a tragic heroine.<PAGE>I'm just kidding. That \nwould be awful!♪'
00263708:'The coliseum is a cornucopia \nof thrills and excitement.<PAGE>But, for some reason...it's \njust not enough anymore.'
00263709:'The matches in the coliseum just \ndon't satisfy me anymore.<PAGE>Why? What does \nit mean?'
00263710:'I'm completely addicted \nto the coliseum's \ncharms.<PAGE>That's why I made up my mind to \nlive here permanently. Now I just \nhave to save up some Gald...'
00263711:'I left a husband behind, but \nit doesn't really bother me.<PAGE>The coliseum is more important \nthan a husband.'
00263712:'My. oh my...\nWhy do they fight \nhere of all places?<PAGE>If you want to fight, \nget to the coliseum!'
00263713:'If they want to fight, \nthey should try beating \nsomeone in the coliseum.<PAGE>Honestly, these bloody-minded \nmen are really a pain!'
00263714:'A bearded man \nwith a pale face ran \naway from here.<PAGE>There was a dog chasing him... \nNo, it was more like a monster... \nIs there a monster inside the barrier...?'
00263715:'The guy running away, \nand even the dog, \nboth looked terrible!'
00263716:'I'm originally \nfrom Zaphias, but \nI moved here.<PAGE>The seaside view and the smell of the \nsea are wonderful, but most importantly \nthis is where the coliseum is.'
00263717:'I may have left my husband behind in Zaphias, \nbut he always had more time for his hobbies \nthan he did me. Now we're even.'
00263718:'I left my husband in Zaphias to \nbe near the coliseum, but sometimes \nI get a little worried...<PAGE>Is he eating right? Is he \ncleaning up after himself?'
00263719:'Of course, I forget all \nabout my husband when \nthe matches begin.'
00263720:'Just look at this town. Full \nof warships and knights.<PAGE>I thought this place was so \nunlike Zaphias, but now it isn't \nvery different at all.'
00263721:'Even so, it's worth \nit as long as the coliseum \nkeeps running.'
00263722:'I was just another immigrant when I first \nmoved here, but now I've really gotten used \nto the place and made a lot of friends.<PAGE>...Just a little joke. No, \nall I care about are the \nmatches in the coliseum.'
00263723:'All my cares are washed \naway when the matches \nbegin...'
00263724:'What's wrong with the sky? That \nmust be over in Ilyccia.<PAGE>Is Zaphias safe? \nMy husband...'
00263725:'I'm not exactly sure why, but I'm worried \nabout my husband in Zaphias...'
00263726:'I've decided to return to Zaphias \nfor a little while, and bring \nmy husband back here with me.<PAGE>It's much better \nliving in Nordopolica \nnow, anyway.'
00263727:'I love watching the matches alone, \nbut maybe they'll be even more exciting \nwith my husband beside me.'
00263728:'These are the docks. If you \nwish to travel by sea, you \nmay depart from here.'

00263757:'What did I see, you ask? \nA monster. A monster!<PAGE>I mistakenly stepped into the pathway, \nand saw the very moment it changed shape \nfrom human to beast...*shiver*...'
00263758:'Did the coliseum \nmonster escape...?<PAGE>It’s gone?! \nThe monster that looks \nlike a big fox...'
00263759:'I’ve seen that monster before... \nMan, if that thing goes off on one, \nit’s gonna get real serious real quick.'
00263760:'That monster I saw awhile ago at the back \nof the coliseum...what could it have been?<PAGE>It was certainly fearsome, but there \nwas something almost celestial about \nit that gave me goosebumps...'
00263761:'Perhaps it was a guardian \ndeity that protects \nour city...?'
00263762:'There's something disquieting \nin the air recently...<PAGE>I suppose you'd call it sixth sense. \nI just have a feeling something \nawful is going to happen...'
00263763:'O guardian deity, please \nprotect your city \nand its citizens...'
00263764:'Our guardian deity...the \nmonster...it was killed.<PAGE>Guildsmen from the \nUnion did it. What \nbarbarians...'
00263765:'If that really was \nour guardian, this \ncity is finished.'
00263766:'They say it was the \nguardian deity that \nkilled Duce Belius. <PAGE>I suppose it wasn't our \nguardian at all...just \na common monster.'
00263767:'How pitiful to be without a guardian \ndeity, without Duce Belius...and \nprotected by the Knights.'
00263768:'Lord Natz is \nworking hard as \ninterim Duce.<PAGE>Unlike Duce Belius, we're \nable to see him frequently...one \nfeels very close to him.'
00263769:'It's true he doesn't have the charisma \nDuce Belius had, even though she \nalways kept herself hidden away.'
00263770:'Lord Natz is doing his very \nbest to protect this city.<PAGE>Now all the citizens have to make a \nconcerted effort to unite behind him.'
00263771:'I don't care what's happening in \nany of the other cities. If Nordopolica \nis peaceful, I'm happy.'
00263772:'You lot came to fight, didn't \nyou? I can tell by your eyes. \nWhat a bunch of eager beavers!<PAGE>How I love to see people \nlike you get the stuffing \nkicked out of them.'
00263773:'Hey, no offense. This may \nbe a spectator arena, but \nthe monsters are monsters.<PAGE>It's not unusual for some pretty \ntough customers to leave the \ncoliseum bruised and broken.'
00263774:'Hey you, what are you \ndoing wandering about?<PAGE>Aer krene? Phaeroh? \nWhat are you \ntalking about?'

00263778:'A bearded old man ran \nout of the coliseum \nand out of town.<PAGE>There are many like him that just \nrun away after losing a tournament.'
00263779:'The old man that ran away \nwas different to the normal \nsorts you get at the coliseum...<PAGE>Well, I guess there \nare some like him \nthere...sometimes. '
00263780:'You're travelers, right? I'll \ntell it to you straight. There's \nnothing on this continent.<PAGE>There's a road, but it's a dead end. The \ncaves are all full of monsters, and beyond \nthem is desert and desolate mountains.'
00263781:'There's a town out there \nthey call an oasis, but it's \njust another sand pit.<PAGE>Look, I won't say any more. \nYou best get back on your ship \nand go home to mama, huh?'
00263782:'Oh, man...what do they think \nthey're doing, just letting \nthe Knights in like that?<PAGE>A lot of people here \nhate the Empire. There \nmight be trouble.'
00263783:'Not that I'd mind. Maybe \nwe'll have us a little \nbit of sightseeing.'
00263784:'What? Belius is dead? Now things \nare really getting interesting.<PAGE>The only reason this town lasted \nis because Belius was around.'
00263785:'Seems like more Knights are coming in \nto Nordopolica every day. I wonder what \nPalestralle's going to do about it?<PAGE>Heh-heh...This is going \nto be fun. A real show!'
00263786:'How boring...the Knights are \nactually pretty well-behaved.<PAGE>You might even say it's thanks to them \nthings have quieted down around here.'
00263787:'Hmph. I'm surprised at how spineless \nthe people here really are.<PAGE>Not to mention, Belius turned out to \nbe a lot less popular than I thought.'
00263788:'Ha ha ha ha! What the hell's that \nthing in the sky? Some kind of monster? \nLooking good, looking good!<PAGE>What's this then, the end of the \nworld? Ha ha ha! Bring it on!'
00263789:'I don't care. I don't care if this \ntown, this continent, the entire \nworld goes up in flames. Hmph.'
00263790:'Now it's Ilyccia \nin a panic!<PAGE>The seas and the skies going mad! \nHow festive! It's a party, a \nbig old party! Ha ha ha ha!'
00263791:'...I don't know. Now I'm feeling empty. \nWhat the hell am I carrying on about?<PAGE>If I don't act like this...if I \nstart to see what's really going \non...it'll be so frightening...'
00263792:'I came to Desier to search \nfor the origin of we \nKritya in the west.<PAGE>But the mountain path has \ncollapsed, and I've had \nto forsake that goal...'
00263793:'If only I could get beyond the mountain \npath...the land beyond is flat and \nwould be comparatively easy going.<PAGE>At least, that's how it \nlooks on the maps.\n'
00263794:'It seems I have much more hard \ntravel to endure if I'm to discover \nthe origin of the Kritya.<PAGE>Even if I somehow get through the \nmountains, they say the lands beyond \nare vast and brutal desert.'
00263795:'The only people I can imagine going \nout into that desert would be pioneers, \nthrillseekers, or madmen.'
00263796:'I'm considering postponing my quest \nfor the origins of the Kritya \nand staying here for a while.<PAGE>Belius, the Duce of Nordopolica, \nhas expressed a desire \nin meeting me.'
00263797:'If things go well, \nshe may offer me \nemployment...'
00263798:'I can't believe Duce Belius \nis dead...we were supposed to meet \nand have all manner of discussions.<PAGE>What an unfortunate twist of fate. \nIt was such a promising chance...'
00263799:'This must be a message from the \nheavens: "Go and discover the \norigin of the Kritya"...'
00263800:'I've had Lord Natz arrange \nfor me to work at the \ncoliseum's library.<PAGE>It's quite befitting a city of such history. \nThere are enough books there to satisfy \nany Kritya's thirst for knowledge.'
00263801:'I may even be able to discover \nour origins without ever having \nto go beyond those mountains.'
00263802:'I once saw an image that looked \nvery much like that ominous \nshadow in the sky.<PAGE>It must have been in one of \nthe books in my parents' room, \nwhen I was very young...'
00263803:'I get the feeling we Kritya somehow \nhave a very deep connection \nto that beast in the sky...'
00263804:'Long ago, the clans of old and the human \nruling class stood in partnership, \nunited through Kritya mediation.<PAGE>This may finally be \nour time to stand up.'
00263805:'Yes, I remember now. It \nwas in a passage in one \nof my parents' books.<PAGE>Be it lies or truth, I \nbelieve this is a duty \nassigned to our people.'
00263806:'*Huff*...*huff*...*huff*...<PAGE>What...*pant*...am \nI...*pant*...doing?'
00263807:'Whew...I'm thinking about \ntaking part in a tournament, \nthat's what.<PAGE>I'm in training, you see. \nGot to build stamina.'
00263808:'*Huff*...*huff*...*huff*...*huff*...\n*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...\nI'm starting to get bored with...<PAGE>*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...\n...Swinging this sword...'
00263809:'Whew...Maybe go for a jog \noutside town? No...the monsters \nare too dangerous...'
00263810:'*Huff*...*huff*...*huff*...*huff*...\n*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...\nThe Knights are such a pain...<PAGE>*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...\n...I wish they wouldn't...look at me...\n...It's so...embarrassing...'
00263811:'...What do we even need \nwith the Knights when \nwe're around...?'
00263812:'*Huff*...*huff*... I'm doing my \nbest to build up stamina \nhere, and Belius up and dies?<PAGE>If they stop the tournaments...\n*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...\nThis will all have been...for nothing...'
00263813:'Whew...Cados is closed, sea \nroutes are closed, and the mountain \npath is impassable.<PAGE>Nordopolica's completely \nindependent now...'
00263814:'Don! Don! Doooooon!! Aaaaaah...!! \nThe Don...how could the \nDon have died...?!<PAGE>This shock...how am I supposed...to \nexpress it?!'

00263816:'*Huff*...*huff*... This is no \ntime...to mourn... *Pant*...*pant*... \n...the Don's death...<PAGE>*Huff*...*huff*... Now I have \nto train... *Pant*...*pant*... \n...to kill that monster...!'
00263817:'Whew...I wonder how much training \nI'll have to do to be able \nto kill that thing...?'
00263818:'*Huff* *huff*... I'll keep swinging \nthis sword... *Pant*...*pant*... \nfor tomorrow...!'
00263819:'Whew...the road to victory \nis a long, rugged, and vicious\none...'
00263820:'This city is governed by the Guild \nknown as Palestralle, and their \nchief is a woman named Belius.<PAGE>Here in the city, they \ncall her the "Duce" \nout of respect.'
00263821:'This world may be a wide one, \nbut the only Guild governing an \nentire city is Palestralle.<PAGE>Dahngrest is different...in \nactuality, it's ruled by \nthe Don and his Union.'
00263822:'Nordopolica exists \ncompletely independent \nfrom the Empire.<PAGE>So even if a riot breaks out, \nthe Knight's are not \nallowed to intervene.'
00263823:'If the knights did intervene, \nthis would be a big deal!'
00263824:'The coliseum is divided into three areas: \nThe market district, the residential \ndistrict, and the coliseum itself.<PAGE>Outsiders are strictly forbidden from \nentering the residential district in \nthe interest of keeping the peace.'
00263825:'I'm told you can enter the residential \ndistrict if you become a citizen.<PAGE>I can't imagine there'd \nbe much of interest \nthere, though.'
00263826:'The monsters in the coliseum are \nsupposed to get much fiercer \nwhen the new moon approaches.<PAGE>That's why they post especially tough \nmembers of Palestralle to keep watch \non the night of the new moon.'
00263827:'I just happened to be inside the \ncoliseum when the reverse barrier \nholding in the monsters failed.<PAGE>It was very frightening, but I'm glad \nit happened during the full moon, when \nthe monsters are relatively docile.'
00263828:'The coliseum city is \ncompletely independent \nfrom the Empire.<PAGE>That's partly thanks to it being located \nso far from Ilyccia, where Zaphias is.'
00263829:'I'm sure letting Knights in \nlike this goes against the citizenry's \nbetter judgment.'
00263830:'They say the person who was actually \nin charge of managing Palestralle \nwas the interim Duce, Natz.<PAGE>Belius's death doesn't seem to \nhave been attributed to any failing \nof his management, either.'
00263831:'With that said, the loss of a \nspiritual leader like Belius \nis a great one for this city.'
00263832:'I hear the Knights have lost their \ncaptains, and the influence they wield \nis splitting up here and there.<PAGE>It might not be long before \nNordopolica is in the hands \nof Palestralle again.'

00263835:'Maybe it's time for us to pray \nto her, too. For our own safety, \nand for peace in the world...'
00263836:'Hey, mister. Why \ndoesn't that statue \nhave a head?<PAGE>Did someone play a \nprank and steal it?'
00263837:'Is it supposed to be a lady? She must \nhave been really pretty, if people \nwanted to make a statue out of her.<PAGE>How nice...I hope they \nmake a statue of \nme some day, too.'
00263838:'There's a cave called Cados to \nthe west of town, you know.<PAGE>I've been told I mustn't \ngo near it because \nit's so dangerous.'
00263839:'They say it makes a squeaking \nnoise like a flute or something \nwhen the wind blows.<PAGE>That's why it has another name, \nyou know: "The Weasand of Cados".'
00263840:'Some monsters got out of the coliseum. The \nreverse barrier must not be very strong!<PAGE>I wonder if they'll come \nand eat me when I'm \nsleeping at night...?'
00263841:'By the way, it's called a reverse barrier because \nit's supposed to keep monsters in...the opposite \nof the barriers that keep monsters out.'

00263936:'This town is a treasure trove of \ninformation. We have its long and \nstoried history to thank for that.<PAGE>The more I study, the more \nthe machinations of this \nworld grow clear to me.'
00263937:'The Empire's history goes back roughly\neight hundred years. This city is even older...\nsome twelve hundred years old, in fact.<PAGE>It begins at a time when this was just \na primitive stone dueling ground.'
00263938:'About twenty or thirty kilometers \nwest is a tall mountain range \ncalled the Mother Cados mountains. <PAGE>It's quite a meaningful name, \nbut it's only used by \nfolks in this town.'

00263944:'Duce Belius? I haven't yet had the \nhonor of meeting her, but it seems as \nif she has some interest in Kritya.<PAGE>I don't know \nwhy, however.'
00263945:'This descendant of an ancient \nclan, the woman who governs \na city of such contrasts...<PAGE>Yes, the woman called \nBelius interests \nme greatly.'
00263946:'It's a good thing there \nare Knights here to protect \nthe city's security.<PAGE>One does have to wonder what the \nwarships are for, however.'
00263947:'One small misstep, and \nthose warships could destroy \nthis entire town.<PAGE>What a terrible blow to \nhistory the loss of this \nripe old city would be.'
00263948:'Duce Belius has passed away...I must \noffer my heartfelt condolences.<PAGE>Death means a great loss, but \nat the same time a rite of passage \nfor those who still live.'
00263949:'One cannot feign ignorance and \npretend to be dispassionate on the \noccasion of someone's death.<PAGE>This city will surely be \nfacing a time of trial.'
00263950:'The tale of the legendary disaster \nis written of in this city's \nvast library as well.<PAGE>I never imagined \nit would be so \nrepugnant...'
00263951:'Should that disaster truly try \nto attack the city, the barrier \nwill be meaningless.<PAGE>Is this how humanity \nwill end...?'

00263954:'I came here to visit my friend, \nafter he moved into the \nresidential district.<PAGE>But they won't let \nme inside...'
00263955:'After coming all this way I was \ndead set on seeing the \ntournament, but it's sold out...<PAGE>Sheesh, way to kick a guy when he's \ndown. What the heck am I gonna do if \nmy luck gets any worse than this?'

00263963:'I'm not a rich man. I'm not \neven sure how I'm going to \npay for the trip back home.'
00263964:'The Knights are surprisingly cheap. All I \ndid was ask them to lend me a little money, \nbut they aren't giving me a single Gald.<PAGE>Aren't the Knights supposed \nto help good, decent \ncitizens in need?'
00263965:'Surely it wouldn't \nhurt to lend me enough \nto buy supper...'
00263966:'Hey, those warships are going back \nto Zaphias eventually, right?<PAGE>Where's the harm \nin letting me catch \na ride onboard?'

00263971:'But it's not like I can stay here \nforever...even my friend's been \ncold to me lately...*sigh*...'
00263972:'We were relieved because \nwe thought the monster was \naway to Ilyccia...<PAGE>But then we were attacked by\nsomething weird. Disasters occur\nwhen you least expect them!'

00263977:'The coliseum is massive enough to not \nonly hold a crowd of spectators, but an \nentire residential district as well.<PAGE>As you can see, we have a market, \nan inn...the coliseum is really one\ngiant city.'
00263978:'On the way to the Sands of Kogorh,\n there is a shortcut through \nthe Cados mountain range.<PAGE>But it's just sand. \nWhat on earth do you \nwant to go there for?'
00263979:'That reminds me, the Cados mountain\npass was closed off by fallen rocks\nsome years ago. I think...'

00263985:'That fact is the pride of every man, \nwoman and child in Nordopolica.<PAGE>Of course, outsiders seem to have \na hard time understanding it.'
00263986:'I'm astounded they let Imperial Knights in. Not \nto worry, though...Palestralle and the warriors \nfrom the coliseum are all tough cookies.<PAGE>They'll have the Knights \nthrown out in no time.'

00264003:'We may have had a bit of trouble \nhere lately, but now they're \nway out of bounds.<PAGE>I want to raise some serious protest, \nbut it's out of my league...'
00264004:'The Union's really \ndone it now...<PAGE>I always knew the Don \nwas after the Duce's \ngood stuff!'
00264005:'The only faction that can stand \ntoe-to-toe with the Union and \nthe Empire is Palestralle.<PAGE>The Don in the north and Belius to the \nsouth...they weren't playing around.'
00264006:'The interim Duce's doing a pretty good \njob of keeping Palestralle together.<PAGE>Our only problem now is the \nKnights making such a nuisance \nof themselves in town...'
00264007:'The whole deal with the Union was just \na misunderstanding. Why do we still \nhave to have the Knights watch us?'

00264640:'If you're looking for\nyour friends, they're\noutside already.'
00264641:'Welcome, travelers. \nIt's 50 Gald per night...will \nyou stay?'
00264642:'<inn>Would you like to rest?'
00264643:'Thank you. Come \nback for a stay \nany time.'
00264644:'Hmm? Are you all right already?<PAGE>You can rest as long \nas you need to.'
00264645:'Don't you go getting yourselves \nknocked out again, you hear?<PAGE>Next time, I'll be \ncharging boarding \nfee! Tee-hee.'
00264646:'You're all wearing such \nunusual clothes.<PAGE>We don't really see anything \nlike them around here. Did you \ncome from very far away?'
00264647:'Is your food \nvery different \nas well?<PAGE>I'd love to hear \nsome recipes from \nyour hometowns.'
00264648:'It's so hot...there's no shade \nat all...wearing this armor \nis like being on a grill...<PAGE>Stand guard here...? \nIt's torture...'
00264649:'Our mission is to protect \nthe Ruins' Gate researchers \nfrom monsters, but...<PAGE>...I think the heat is going \nto kill us first...'
00264650:'When will I be able \nto...go home...?<PAGE>They swore...a relief unit was \ncoming to take over for us...'
00264651:'...Hey...it scares me to \nthink about this, but...<PAGE>You don't think this is a demotion \ntransfer...do you...?'
00264652:'Ah! You are friends \nof Sir <STR>(FRE)?<PAGE>Please, ask me anything. \nI'll be happy to tell \nyou whatever I can!'
00264653:'We are here investigating the \nruins, to determine why Captain \nAlexei came to these lands!<PAGE>However, with ruin excavation being \noutside our realm of expertise, we have \nemployed the help of Ruins' Gate!'
00264654:'I'm ashamed to say we have a knight \ncollapsing every single day here.<PAGE>My partner fell unconscious as well, \nand was withdrawn back to Zaphias. He \nalways pushes himself too hard...'
00264655:'The bizarre monster that \nappeared in the sky...what \ndo you suppose it is?<PAGE>It smells like an emergency situation \nto me, but with things as they are...we \nwouldn't be any help...'
00264656:'The <STR>(FRE) Brigade is a \nranger unit, so we were able to \nsee so many different places...<PAGE>To be frank, standing guard \nhere isn't very fun at \nall. And it's so hot...'
00264657:'Captain <STR>(FRE) may seem \nso kind, but he pushes \nhis men hard.<PAGE>Of course, you can't really \ncomplain when he's pushing \nhimself so hard, too.'
00264658:'I haven't seen any other units \nat all lately, let alone \nour replacement unit...<PAGE>I wonder if all the other knights \nhave gone to deal with that \nstrange monster in the sky.'
00264659:'I hear our captain \nis leading the way.<PAGE>Say...you don't suppose Sir <STR>(FRE) \nhas forgotten about us because \nof that monster, do you?'
00264660:'I suppose things as strange as the Imperial \nKnights hiring us for something other \nthan blastia excavation do happen.<PAGE>We're supposed to be searching for clues as to some \nknight captain's motive. Do you think there's \nbeen some internal friction among the Knights?'
00264661:'Whatever the reason, all we have \nto do is complete the investigation \nwe've been tasked with.<PAGE>The areas we have to search are \nrather harsh on this job, though. \nWe'll have to charge extra...'
00264662:'Our initial investigations have \nrevealed one thing. These ruins \nare very mysterious...<PAGE>We believe they're some one thousand years \nold, but we haven't been able to identify \nthe reasons for this weathering.'
00264663:'Even supposing it collapsed \ndue to a monster attack...the \nweathering is so unnatural.<PAGE>By the good name of \nRuins' Gate, we'll \nsolve this mystery!'
00264664:'Hmm...these ruins \nare so intriguing.<PAGE>Judging by the condition of these stone \nfragments, I'd say this place is very old...perhaps \nas much as a thousand years.'
00264665:'Looking at these fragments, I think \nit's safe to venture that this place \nwas destroyed by some outside force.<PAGE>There were no blastia yet, so \nperhaps the collapse was because \nof a monster attack...'
00264666:'These ruins are so unusual...but \npeople definitely \nlived here.<PAGE>We've found several \ntraces of habitation.'
00264667:'Pieces of buildings, too. Monsters \ndon't really have architectural \nskills, now do they?<PAGE>If I had to guess, \nI'd say this was a Kritya \nsettlement...'

00264681:'Well... I just wanted to \nsay something like that. <PAGE>I feel so different \nin this costume.'
00264682:'Hmmm. A festival for lower class people \nis more fun than I was expecting. <PAGE>The world they live \nis too different\nfrom the world I live in...'
00264683:'I've seen their performance many times but \nI don't get tired of them at all! <PAGE>Ahh, \nI want to see their performance \nmore and more!!!'
00264684:'Do you guys know? \nThe Showtime, play Guild is \nhere for their performance! <PAGE>They are famous for \ntheir hard to get \ntickets. '
00264685:'There, there. It's there! \nHey, hurry up! <PAGE>Don't give me that weird look! '
00264686:'Here, here! \nThe (c) M sculpture \nis here! <PAGE>I wonder how many more times? \nTwo times? Three times? or \nHumm... '
00264687:'I am going to wear this \nto the ball tonight. <PAGE>Well, it's only a Lantern \nFestival Dance though..'
00264688:'Tee-hee-hee. \nIsn't this dress \ncute! <PAGE>I secretly borrowed this from \nthe costume room. \nDon't tell anybody! '
00264689:'It's a double push! '
00264690:'It's very unprofitable...'
00264691:'I want to try goldfish scooping,\nbut I also want some stir-fry\nnoodles, or maybe even some pizza...'
00264692:'There's so much\nto choose from! ∀'
00264693:'This is made from\nthe finest material.<PAGE>What do you think?\nLooks good, huh? '
00264694:'Armor that covers the whole body \nis heavy, but armor like this \nis just the right weight. <PAGE>It makes me feel like I \nwant to kill monsters. '
00264695:'The special stage\nis up ahead.<PAGE>You can watch plays\nand musicals there.'

00264697:'An 8, huh?\nThat’s a tough one.<PAGE>It seems like it could\nbe a LOW, yet it could\nturn out to be a HIGH...'
00264698:'Huh? \nOf course, \nI am talking about double-up. <PAGE>There is a trap\nafter continuous successes. '
00264699:'You can bring \nyour handouts \nfor this test. <PAGE>You might think it makes it easy, but \nit means that it'll be that much harder. '
00264700:'I am definitely going to get \na Mishica PhD! '

00264710:'Her love completes me, \nbody and sould. I'm sure \nshe feels the same. '
00264711:'... I'm happy he built a \nhome for me and all, but...\nIt's just a tent...<PAGE>I wish it had been a log \ncabin or something, \nlike that one over there... '
00264712:'A tent... Well, I guess it's \nbetter than camping out on the \nroad like the last few days. '
00264713:'What's gonna happen? I hear the \nblastia will stop working... \nI'm starving...<PAGE>This guy talks about \nlove, love, love... but \nthat's not all there is... '
00264714:'More than love... there's money. \nThat's right! This guy \nhas money, right?<PAGE>He kind of goes \noverboard, but I \nguess I can deal...'
00264715:'<inn>Will you be staying? '
00264716:'Come visit us any time! '
00264717:'We're fully stocked up \non supplies now. \nNo more inconveniences! '
00264718:'This is all thanks to the \nsupport that Fortune's \nMarket gave us.'
00264719:'Geez, my wife's \nstill complainin'. \nI can't stand this!<PAGE>That woman, she just won't give \nin... Even though she's really \ngotten used to it here by now. '
00264720:'When I'm working, I can \nforget my wife's whining. \nIt feels great! '
00264721:'I guess this is how \npeople form bonds. '
00264722:'The world should never have \nto face crises, but this \ntown owes its existence to one. '
00264723:'There could still be\na few monsters roaming\nin the residential district.<PAGE>We’re going to stay here\nuntil we can confirm it is safe.'
00264724:'We’re going to keep\nthis town safe.'
00264725:'All lives carry with \nthem pain and burden.'
00264726:'But the Tree of Halure endures \nit all, in infinite patience.'
00264727:'Most people are in \ntheir beds sick. <PAGE>Maybe something's going \naround. I seem to be the \nonly one who's okay.'
00264728:'Everyone got sick after \nthat tower showed up.'
00264729:'*Woof!*'
00264730:'*Woof♪*'
00264731:'Hey, were you \nplaying tag with \nthe Knights?'
00264732:'Hey, why don't you join the \n<STR>(FRE) Defense Force, too?<PAGE>Hee-hee. I'm the founder \nof the <STR>(FRE) Defense \nForce, you know.'
00264733:'I've watched him for a while. \nI formed the Defense Force \nwhen he made captain. <PAGE>Our main activities are \nrooting for <STR>(FRE) and \ntalking with other members.'
00264734:'I was so worried with \nthe barrier gone.<PAGE>I don't know what \nwould've happened if the \nbarrier didn't get fixed.'
00264735:'I have to thank whoever \nfixed the barrier blastia.'
00264736:'They say young \n<STR>(FRE) built a \nnew town in Hypionia.<PAGE>Will you be joining <STR>(FRE)\nthere, <STR>(YUR)?'
00264737:'I'd love to go myself, \nbut traveling so far \nat this age...'
00264738:'This is all the imperial \nfamily's fault. They neglected \ntheir duties as our guardians.'
00264739:'I'm not scared...\nI'm not scared.<PAGE>I can do it...\nI can do it.'
00264740:'I-I gave up my life in\nZaphias to be here.<PAGE>A few monsters a-aren’t\ngoing to s-scare me....'
00264741:'T-the monsters are lose?!<PAGE>Eek! I-I'm scared...!'
00264742:'What's going on upstairs?!\nLet's make a run for it...<PAGE>Oh! My legs can't move...'
00264743:'I'm strong...yes, very strong.\nI'm the strongest one in the\nworld...no, in the universe!'
00264744:'But...no matter how much I encourage \nmyself, I've never been very \nstrong at all... Oh dear...'
00264745:'You there! \nThis exit is for \nnobles only.<PAGE>Common rabble like you \nshould use the exit \nin the lower quarter.'
00264746:'No no no. I don't care if you're \ndesperate. Try again when you \nare of the proper status. <PAGE>You would have no problem \nif you were, say, the \nCommandant of the Knights.'
00264747:'This exit is for \nnobles only. <PAGE>You cannot leave \nfrom here. No no no.'
00264748:'Well...I suppose I \ncould let you pass \nif you were famous.'
00264749:'Just look at the low folk \nmiserably crawling about \nin the muck again today. <PAGE>Don't you wish you could \ncrush them beneath your heel?'
00264750:'They wear filthy rags and \neat garbage. An absolutely \ndreadful existence! <PAGE>If I got thrown into the \nlower quarter, I'd lose \nmy sanity in two minutes.'
00264751:'I bet if I tossed down a few Gald \nfrom here I could get them all to \nmake a mad scramble for it!<PAGE>How I'd like to try...'
00264752:'Look at that pack of \nhyenas down there. \nDisgusting!'
00264753:'Zaphias' barrier has disappeared! \nI'll bet it broke again! \nWe must inspect the barrier blastia!'
00264754:'Researchers from Aspio\nmust be summoned to fix the \nbarrier blastia at once!'
00264755:'There was a giant earthquake! \nThe shock came from the north!'
00264756:'Thanks to that nasty earthquake, \nall my elegant furniture and \ncrockery is smashed!<PAGE>Who do I sue \nfor damages?!'
00264757:'I returned because \nI heard the capital\nwas safe again. <PAGE>So what are you \ncommoners doing in \nthe royal quarter?'
00264758:'It is best to be in the city \nno matter what might happen.<PAGE>After all, the Knights are \nhere to protect Zaphias.'
00264759:'A long, thin structure \nappeared to the north. <PAGE>It's so tall it pierces the clouds. \nI wonder how far it goes...? \nYou can't see the top.'
00264760:'How could such a gigantic \nthing have been built?'
00264761:'I knew it. The capital's \nback to normal. It's because \nwe nobles are well-protected.'
00264762:'I'm not worried about \nmonsters or the barrier.<PAGE>Why? Because the \nnobles are protected!'
00264763:'First that hideous monster, \nnow a strange tower. \nAnything can happen...'
00264764:'Who cares what's next, as long as \nZaphias is safe. I don't give \na damn about anyone outside!'
00264765:'Do something! \nSomebody go get a \npowerful mage or something!<PAGE>What are we supposed \nto do if the barrier \nvanishes again?!'
00264766:'I'm a noble! \nI'll give you all the \nmoney you want!<PAGE>Someone, anyone! \nGet rid of those monsters \naround Zaphias!'
00264767:'The Knights and all the other \nnobles say it's safe now, \nbut that thing's still in the sky. <PAGE>How can it \npossibly be safe? \nWell?!'
00264768:'Who can I trust? \nWho's going to save me? \nSomebody tell me, please!'
00264769:'We treasure the Tree \nof Halure as much \nas we do our lives.<PAGE>So to us, you all \nare our saviors. We \nowe you our lives.'
00264770:'Any problem you have--any \nproblem at all--don't \nhesitate to let us know.'
00264771:'We decided to take \nin refugees from \nthe capital. <PAGE>And we're so encouraged \nby His Highness Ioder's \nsupport.'
00264772:'We are all fellow \ncompatriots! <PAGE>If the people of the capital\nare in trouble, we must \nextend a helping hand.'
00264773:'Do you know how long \nthe Tree of Halure has \nbeen here? <PAGE>I do.'
00264774:'They say the Tree of \nHalure has been here since \nmy grandpa was a kid.'
00264775:'My grandpa just \nsleeps all the time. \nHe never gets up. <PAGE>I wonder if it's just old age...?'
00264776:'I feel great! \nI'm young! <PAGE>...I just get a little \ndizzy sometimes...'
00264777:'I'm sure the flowers are \npretty because they bloom \nas hard as they can! <PAGE>To honor them... \nI'm gonna drink \nas hard as I can!'
00264778:'Ohhh... \nNothing beats drinks \nunder the blossoms...'
00264779:'I feel kinda dizzy... I wonder \nif it's the drinks... <PAGE>But... \nIt feels a little... \ndifferent...'
00264780:'Ugh... \nI'm pretty sure this... \nisn't a hangover...'
00264781:'Our town, Halure...no, the Tree \nof Halure...grew this big by just \naccepting all that transpires. <PAGE>And I am sure it \nwill continue to do so.'
00264782:'I think the trick to living is \nto accept what comes, \nno matter what it may be.'
00264783:'Something strange is going \non. Many people are \nreporting feeling sick. <PAGE>Healers are running \naround everywhere.'
00264784:'I feel fine today, but I \nfelt terrible yesterday. <PAGE>I wonder how my \nbody will feel tomorrow...'
00264785:'So, I heard the Don died? \nIt’s nonsense, if you ask me.<PAGE>So what if one of those big \nshots is dead? What’s the \nbig deal, anyway?'
00264786:'Someone younger is bound to\ncome along and take the Don’s place\nand lead the Guilds anyway.<PAGE>I can’t be bothered with\nsomething as trifle as this.'
00264787:'Rumor has it that Alexei\nhas seized control of Zaphias.<PAGE>Well, I saw this day coming.'
00264788:'While we’re on this topic,\nI think that captain, Flynn\nis pretty fishy too.<PAGE>I don’t know. Let’s just\nsay I’ve got a hunch for\nthese things...'
00264789:'The Imperial Knight's captain\n <STR>(FRE) put refugees on ship\nfrom Zaphias and headed south.<PAGE>I bet they're going to work those\nguys down to the bones.'
00264790:'What happens to the\npeople in Zaphias has\nnothing to do with me!'
00264791:'That hideous monster! It was\nhovering above Aspio, wasn't it?\nDid the mages put it there?'
00264792:'I've always thought\nthose darn mages\nwere up to no good.'
00264793:'That tower is close\nto Aspio, right?<PAGE>Those mages must\nbe up to something.'
00264794:'They must have revived\nthat tower for some reason.<PAGE>Just like how they monopolized the\nblastia and got the Empire to back\nthem up. I don’t trust those guys.'
00264795:'I don’t care who's plotting to\ndo what anymore.<PAGE>Either way, the Empire nor\nthe Guilds are going to do\nanything for us.'
00264796:'I bet someone built that tower out of\nself-interest because they’ve got a score\nto settle with the Empire or the Guilds.'
00264797:'The skies cleared up...Those mermen\nare roaming the sea whenever it’s sunny\nat this time of the year.'
00264798:'If it rains, we can’t go out to sea.\nIf it’s sunny, we've got those mermen\nto deal with...*sigh*'
00264799:'You know, I was a member\nof the pirate guild, Siren’s Fang.<PAGE>Then the boss died, and everyone\nwent their own ways...'
00264800:'You’ve never heard of Siren’s \nFang? It was the guild of the \nking of the pirates, Aifread.'
00264801:'An Imperial naval ship set\nout for Nordopolica a little\nwhile ago.<PAGE>At any rate, it’s tough for a guy\nlike me who’s just trying to make an\nhonest living to send a ship out to sea.'
00264802:'So, Nordopolica has fallen\nunder the jurisdiction of the\nEmpire at last...<PAGE>I guess Dahngrest\nwill be next.'
00264803:'Taking this many people\nout to sea? This is way\nover the capacity.<PAGE>I just hope we don’t sink...'
00264804:'Those landlubbing knights!\nDon't underestimate the sea!'
00264805:'I heard a lot of sunken treasures\nlie at the bottom of the ocean.<PAGE>I bet that palace on the\nsurface is no exception.'
00264806:'But, all the attention from\nthe public takes away some\nof it's mysterious aura...'
00264807:'I heard there’s a shiny\nnew continent to the\nnortheast of here.<PAGE>I’d like to go if I can only\nget a ship out to sea...'
00264808:'A precursor to a volcanic eruption, maybe? \nOr perhaps the sea level dropped?<PAGE>This is why the seas are \nfull of such romance!'
00264809:'......<PAGE>The magistrate is sleeping.\nSo scram!'
00264810:'I don't want to say\nanything bad.'
00264811:'......<PAGE>The magistrate is not in.\nGet lost!'
00264812:'You sure are pesky.\nWho the heck are you?'
00264813:'......<PAGE>The magistrate is very busy.\nGo home.'
00264814:'He's never going to meet\nwith someone the likes of you.'
00264815:'......<PAGE>The magistrate is not here.\nNow, get lost!'
00264816:'Leave while you still can!\nNow go!'
00264817:'I’ve seen quite a few men\nrow off to sea in a boat...<PAGE>None of them has\nbeen back since...'
00264818:'Hmph! I bet they all found\nthemselves a nice girl in\na town somewhere!'
00264819:'I have the smiles of \nmany men tucked away \nin my memories...<PAGE>They all said I was \nsuch a lovely woman.'
00264820:'...You can't see that?\nUgh. How rude!'
00264821:'No real man is a coward!<PAGE>Who were those losers just now?\nThey were running off crying!'
00264822:'A guy that can laugh in the\nface of danger! Now that’s\nthe kind of man I like!<PAGE>What? Well, I’m still\non the market!'
00264823:'I have the smiles of \nmany men tucked away \nin my memories...<PAGE>They all said I was \nsuch a lovely woman.'

00264827:'Yeager’s dead... What’s going \nto happen to Ruin’s Gate?<PAGE>I guess you don’t have\nthe answer to that...'
00264828:'That still gives me\na reason to slack off...'
00264829:'Everyone calm down.<PAGE>Nothing is going to threaten the\nEmpire as long as the barrier and\nthe knights are around.'

00270050:'Is <STR>(FRE) never \ncoming back to \nthe lower quarter?<PAGE>I don't want him to be a \ncaptain if it means I never \nget to see <STR>(FRE) again...'
00270051:'I dropped my dentures \nand I can't find them... <PAGE>The water from the \nbroken fountain must \nhave washed them away.'

00270060:'I wonder if the same thing's \nhappening in Deidon Hold and \nHalure. I hope they're all right...'
00270061:'It looks like the weirdness in the \nsky cleared up, but some houses in \nthe lower quarter got messed up.<PAGE>The Knights won't do anything \nfor us, so I guess we'll take \ncare of things ourselves.'
00270062:'All we have to do with the \ndebris is clear it away, but the \nmain problem is the buildings. <PAGE>We just don't have enough \nable-bodied folk to work. If only \nthe evacuees would return...'
00270063:'The monsters can get in \nwith the barrier down...<PAGE>Here in Zaphias, we have the \nKnights to keep them at bay, but \nwhat are the other towns doing?'
00270064:'I hope the refugees that \nfled Zaphias are all right...'
00270065:'There was a rumbling from \nthe north, like an earthquake. \nWhat could that have been?'
00270066:'Maybe a giant monster like \nthe one in the sky erupted from \nthe ground? I sure hope not...'
00270067:'Welcome! This shop stays open, \nno matter what. Don't want to \ninconvenience people, you know!'
00270068:'Thanks! Come back \nany time. Like I said, \nwe're always open.'

00270075:'What's going on...? Is the barrier \nblastia going weird? Yeah, \nwe're always open for business.'
00270076:'The sky may be weird, but I'm not \nleaving Zaphias. As long as people \nlive here, they'll need shops.'
00270077:'I can't keep my products \narranged right, but look around \nand pick out what you need.'
00270078:'Sorry it's still such a mess. \nDon't let it put you off! \nCome back soon!'
00270079:'Things may be crazy, \nbut you have to keep your cool. \nYou should shop with a clear mind.'
00270080:'Thanks! Come \nback any time.'
00270081:'I hear <STR>(FRE)'s building a town \nsomewhere. You should buy him \nsomething for all his hard work!'
00270082:'Thanks, buddy! \nIf you see <STR>(FRE), \ngive him my best.'
00270083:'The fountain blastia is \nbroken... At this rate even \nthe houses will be flooded!<PAGE>We have to stop the flow first. \nWe'll think about pumping out \nthe excess water later.'
00270084:'<STR>(YUR), don't just \nstand there! \nYou help out too!'
00270085:'Well well, <STR>(YUR), the \nKnights certainly are \nfond of you.<PAGE>Leblanc and his troupe \nwere just running around \ncalling your name.'
00270086:'Be careful you don't do \nsomething to get <STR>(FRE)\nchasing after you, too!'
00270087:'If it isn't the wanted man!♪<PAGE>You've got that big bounty \non your head... Maybe you \nwant us to catch you?'
00270088:'Don't worry, <STR>(YUR). <PAGE>Turning you in for \na reward wouldn't make \nme very happy.'
00270089:'It seems like <STR>(FRE)'s \nactivities lately have made \nhim quite the celebrity.<PAGE>The girls in town \nhave even formed a \n"<STR>(FRE) Defense Force"!'
00270090:'The <STR>(FRE) Defense \nForce is really \njust a fan club.<PAGE>It sounded like fun, \nso I joined too!♪'
00270091:'To think the aque blastia \nhad just been repaired! \nThey must've done a shoddy job. <PAGE>I even used money \nI'd saved for my wedding \nto get it fixed...'
00270092:'Well, whining isn't going to stop \nall this water. We have to do \nsomething about the fountain. <PAGE>I'd never forgive \nmyself if I let my \ngirl drown.'
00270093:'Well, the water stopped, but \nnow we can't use the fountain. \nSooner or later the water will run out. <PAGE>We better start \nthinking about other \nways to get water.'
00270094:'I used the money I got \nback from the shoddy repair to \nfind new sources of water.<PAGE>My wedding? Nah, we just put it \noff for a little. She'll wait for me. \nBut thanks, <STR>(YUR).'
00270095:'The lower quarter's the same \nas always. The fountain \nblastia is still broken.<PAGE>There's no point in getting \nworked up about it. \nWe'll fix it in good time.'
00270096:'That blastia breaking was bad, \nbut it brought the people of the \nlower quarter together.<PAGE>Even my girl says \nshe's counting on me... \nHeh heh.'
00270097:'Wow, <STR>(FRE)'s amazing! \nYou hear he made captain?<PAGE>He's the pride of \nthe lower quarter.'
00270098:'<STR>(FRE)'s promotion to \ncaptain makes me as \nhappy as if it were myself.'
00270099:'What's that thing \nin the sky that looks \nlike an aurora? <PAGE>Ever since it appeared, the \nsky's been so strange...'
00270100:'What, now the barrier blastia's \nbroken? At least the monsters \nhaven't invaded yet.<PAGE>We have to protect this \ncity. The lower quarter\nis my only home.'
00270101:'This is like the \ndevastation after a \ngiant storm, or something. <PAGE>When things are this bad, \neven getting depressed \nabout it feels stupid.'
00270102:'No point in getting all weepy. \nWe've got to work \ntogether and rebuild.<PAGE>If we can get the lower quarter\nback in shape, maybe everyone \nwho left will come back.'
00270103:'The refugees started coming \nback after things got back \nto normal in Zaphias.<PAGE>Of course, that was right when \nthe monsters showed up and the \nbarrier broke... What a life!'
00270104:'What's become of \nour Zaphias?'
00270105:'<STR>(FRE) took everyone \nto a town with a new barrier. <PAGE>What are you going \nto do, <STR>(YUR)?'
00270106:'They have a barrier, so it's \nsafer there. But I don't want \nto leave the lower quarter.<PAGE>I'm going to stay in the \nlower quarter to the bitter end.'
00270107:'All water for the lower quarter\ncame through that aque blastia... \nNow the pumps in our homes are dry.<PAGE>I don't really understand it, \nbut my husband says the broken \nfountain is the reason.'
00270108:'I wonder what will happen with \nour water. We can't cook, clean, \nor even bathe without it.'
00270109:'Welcome back, <STR>(YUR). \nLooks like you've caused \na ruckus again.<PAGE>They're watching you, \n<STR>(YUR), so don't do anything \ncrazy, okay?'
00270110:'What are you going to do \nnow? <STR>(FRE)'s doing his \nduty as a Knight, but you...'
00270111:'If it isn't <STR>(YUR) and \nthe young lady.<PAGE>So you came back \nto Zaphias.'
00270112:'Don't even think \nabout going uptown.<PAGE>The Knights are still looking \nfor you all, <STR>(YUR).'
00270113:'They say <STR>(FRE)'s doing a great \njob with the Knights. It's all the \nlower quarter can talk about.'
00270114:'You never change, do \nyou <STR>(YUR)? Always letting \n<STR>(FRE) take the lead.<PAGE>I hope you'll show us what \nyou're really made of one \nof these days, <STR>(YUR).'
00270115:'I sold the comb my late \nhusband gave me to help raise \nmoney to fix the blastia. <PAGE>It was the first gift \nhe ever gave me...'
00270116:'Will the house I spent so \nmany years together with \nmy husband in sink...? <PAGE>Why did I \neven bother...?'
00270117:'Thank you so much, <STR>(YUR). \nI think I'll be able to buy back \nthe comb my husband gave me. <PAGE>You seem to have some \ntrouble with the Knights... \nIs everything all right?'
00270118:'The aque blastia \nnever got fixed, did it?<PAGE>What if the barrier \nblastia broke, too? \nThat's a scary thought.'
00270119:'Is it safe for you to come \nback here, <STR>(YUR)? <PAGE>The Knights are all worked \nup looking for you.'
00270120:'Stay away from the \ncastle, you hear? \nThe Knights are on alert.'
00270121:'These are the \npeople you're \ntraveling with...? <PAGE>Isn't it a little dangerous \ntromping around with \ngirls and children?'
00270122:'You be careful now.<PAGE>Leave the dangerous \nthings to the Knights. \nDon't do anything crazy.'
00270123:'I knew you'd come! \n<STR>(YUR), it had to be you!<PAGE>What are you gonna do? \nWhat should I do to help?'
00270124:'<STR>(FRE) would always be here \nin no time when stuff like \nthis happened. Why not now?<PAGE><STR>(FRE) shouldn't live in \nthe castle when he could just \ncommute from the lower quarter.'
00270125:'So, <STR>(YUR), you went and \ngot yourself arrested, huh? Idiot! \nI guess that's like you, though.<PAGE>I went to the royal quarter\nsince you never came back. All \nthe nobles were talking about you.'
00270126:'You were in the castle, right? \nDid you see <STR>(FRE)?<PAGE>Tell <STR>(FRE) the lower quarter's \nin trouble!'
00270127:'<STR>(YUR)! I saw your \nwanted poster.<PAGE>I can't believe there's \na bounty on you! You're \nfamous in the Empire!'
00270128:'But, it's <STR>(FRE)'s job to \nhunt down people with \nbounties on their heads, right? <PAGE>I sure don't want \nyou two to fight...'
00270129:'<STR>(FRE)'s a captain now! \nHe's amazing!<PAGE>And I know <STR>(FRE)'ll keep \nworking for the lower \nquarter, even as a captain.'
00270130:'Did you hear about the \n<STR>(FRE) Defense Force? <PAGE>They made me tell \nthem everything I know \nabout <STR>(FRE).'
00270131:'Ugh... \nI feel awful...'
00270132:'Ever since the sky went all \nfunny, something's just...not \nright. This is horrible...'
00270133:'Great... Just great... \nThe lower quarter's a mess.'
00270134:'I wonder if <STR>(FRE) will rebuild \nthings if we ask. I mean, \n<STR>(FRE)'s really important now!<PAGE><STR>(YUR), go and ask \nfor us!'
00270135:'<STR>(YUR), you're safe!<PAGE>Your friend said things were \nbad, so I was really worried.'
00270136:'No way you'd go down \nthat easy, right, <STR>(YUR)?'
00270137:'<STR>(FRE) built a new \ntown in Hypionia! \nIsn't that amazing?!<PAGE><STR>(FRE)... He's on \nanother level, seriously.'
00270138:'All the members of the <STR>(FRE)\nDefense Force followed \n<STR>(FRE) to his new town.<PAGE>They just don't get it! If they \nreally knew <STR>(FRE), they'd stay \nhere in the lower quarter.'
00270139:'The aque blastia broke, huh?<PAGE>No surprise there. They only \nlet us have old beat-up blastia \nhere in the lower quarter.'
00270140:'If you've got a problem \nwith it, go tell the imperial \nfamily or the Council. <PAGE>They're the ones who \ndecide what we get.'
00270141:'You see that, beyond those buildings? \nThat's our barrier blastia, the Sword Stair. \nIt protects Zaphias from monsters.<PAGE>The barrier is incredibly important... \nOur lives and livelihood depend on it.'
00270142:'Almost all the towns in the \nEmpire have a barrier blastia, \nnot just here in Zaphias.<PAGE>Places without them have \nto fortify and arm themselves \nto keep the monsters out.'
00270143:'The Empire has a monopoly on \nthe various blastia in Zaphias, \nincluding the barrier blastia.'
00270144:'Historically speaking, the \nemperors never had the authority \nto control access to blastia.<PAGE>The imperial family \ndoesn't know their place. \nFools, all of them.'
00270145:'After the incident with magistrate \nRagou, the Council's reputation \nhas taken a huge hit. <PAGE>Now the balance between the Council and \nthe Imperial Knights is wavering... \nWhat will become of our Empire?'
00270146:'There's no question the Empire\nis in a state of disarray. <PAGE>The imperial family \nno longer has the \npower to quell this chaos.'
00270147:'Hey, <STR>(YUR). \nYou come looking \nfor something? <PAGE>Anything you need for work should \nbe lying around here somewhere. \nTake whatever you need.'
00270148:'Onions, carrots, and...\nIs this crate full of bottles? <PAGE>Lucky I noticed, I was just about \nto kick this thing away and \nshatter them all. That was close!'
00270149:'So you're back, <STR>(YUR)? \nUp to your old tricks, I hear.'
00270150:'So who's the \nyoung lady? <PAGE>The poor thing. \nThis nasty place is \nnowhere to bring a girl.'
00270151:'Hey, welcome back! \nNice to see you're \nstill alive.'
00270152:'You should visit \nyour old room \nonce in a while. <PAGE>If you don't take care of it, \nthe dust in there \nwill start forming strata!'
00270153:'The Schwann Brigade, \nthe Cumore Brigade...\nAnd now the <STR>(FRE) Brigade?<PAGE>Impressive, that boy.'
00270154:'I hope the Imperial Knights \nimprove, even a little.'
00270155:'Halt! \nIf you go any further, \nyou'll leave the city. <PAGE>The world outside Zaphias' barrier \nis swarming with monsters. It's too \ndangerous for you equipped like that.'
00270156:'You cannot be allowed \nto leave the city with such \nlight equipment. <PAGE>Come back with the \nproper armaments.'
00270157:'An emergency order \nhas been issued to \nseal off the capital. <PAGE>None may pass.'
00270158:'The gate is sealed. \nNo one may pass until \nthe order is lifted.'
00270159:'Welcome to the Imperial \nCapital of Zaphias.'
00270160:'Welcome to the Imperial \nCapital of Zaphias.'
00270161:'There are monsters just \noutside the barrier! \nIt's far safer inside the capital!<PAGE>Citizens, stay calm. The \nKnights are protecting Zaphias. \nThere is no reason to evacuate!'
00270162:'Damn it all... \nWhat in the world \nis going on?'
00270163:'Welcome to the Imperial \nCapital of Zaphias.'
00270164:'Commandant Alexei rode off \non a monster somewhere. <PAGE>Maybe I should follow him...'
00270165:'With the barrier gone, \nthe Knights are the last line \nof defense for the capital.'
00270166:'If Commandant Alexei truly brought \nthis disaster upon us, it is the Knights' duty \nto protect the city with our very lives.'
00270167:'I don't know if our strong defense \nmade them give up or what, but monsters \nhaven't attacked as much lately. <PAGE>You can rest easy. \nZaphias is a safe \nplace to live.'
00270168:'Zaphias is safe. \nThere is no need to evacuate.'
00270169:'Welcome! \nWelcome to my \nmagnificent atelier! <PAGE>Can you tell that I crackle \nwith ferocious creative power, \nthis very instant?'
00270170:'As you can see, I am an artist. \nI paint portraits, and now I find a \nspectacular subject before me! <PAGE>Will you allow me to paint your \nlikeness? It would surely flex \nmy dazzling creative muscles!'
00270171:'Wait, wait a moment! \nHas the good sir seen my work yet? \nIt burns with a palpable passion!'
00270172:'Your wanted poster. Your wanted \nposter, good sir! It was none other \nthan I who painted it! <PAGE>You're a very distinctive young man, \nso I remembered it well. \nIt is a masterwork, is it not?'
00270173:'Ahh, the hero returns! Your bounty \nkeeps going up and up, and \nI cannot but be filled with joy. <PAGE>Painting your wanted poster \nwas quite worthwhile indeed.'
00270174:'Would that you would do even more \nevil and become an arch-villain to \nforever leave his name in history!'
00270175:'The sky is the color of the water \nafter I paint. Landscapes aren't my \nspecialty, but ohhh, this color...'
00270176:'The other day a dragon flew over \nthe capital! Oh! Such a proud \nmark of winged valor! <PAGE>If you ever see one, do come \ntell me. I must burn that heroic \nsilhouette onto canvas forever!'
00270177:'This time it was a \nphoenix! A phoenix was \nflying over Zaphias! <PAGE>But it was struck \ndown by that uncanny \naurora in the sky!'
00270178:'Might I have been dreaming...? \nI must admit I was up the \nwhole night painting...<PAGE>No matter! Dream or illusion, \nI will paint that dragon! That is \nthe artiste's raison d'etre!'
00270179:'Commandant Alexei started \nsome sort of rebellion...? <PAGE>Hmm. I only ever heard \ngood things about him. \nMaybe he was blinded by greed.'
00270180:'Ah! The heavens have just sent \nme a brilliant idea! Portraits \nof Alexei! Oh, I'll be rich!'
00270181:'Good sir! They say you were \nchildhood friends with the popular \nyoung knight captain? <PAGE>Would deign to let me paint your \ndouble portrait? Two heroes \ndestined to live on in history!'
00270182:'Two youths--childhood friends--now \nfind themselves hunter and hunted! \nAh, cruel fate!... <PAGE>That is how I see the piece. \nDo come back with \nthe young captain.'

00270212:'The capital has been sealed because \nsome thief the Knights caught \nin the royal quarter escaped.<PAGE>They aren't letting anyone \ncross through the barrier.'
00270213:'Isn't closing off the entire \ncity a little excessive? \nIt's such a bother for us citizens.'
00270214:'I heard the Knights uncovered \ntreachery by a magistrate and \nsaved the people of some town.<PAGE>You can always count \non the Knights!'
00270215:'It's all thanks to the Knights \nprotecting the capital that we can spend \nour days in such peace and quiet.'
00270216:'It's been a while now since \nI left the Krityan city and \ncame to live in the capital. <PAGE>It's so quiet. \nIt's really nice here.'
00270217:'Living comfortably \nhelps enrich \nyour heart, too. <PAGE>If you've got a stable \nlivelihood, doesn't that \nput your mind at ease?'
00270218:'Everyone in the city is so kind.<PAGE>I visit the lower quarter sometimes, \ntoo. It's so lively, and the \npeople are so nice. It's great!'
00270219:'If there's ever anything \nI can do to help you, \nplease let me know.'
00270220:'I think it's good that \nthe Empire manages \nthe blastia.<PAGE>People tend to forget that blastia \nare managed because they're \nsuch a part of everyday life.'
00270221:'Regulating private possession \nof blastia is a simple and \neffective way to prevent accidents.'
00270222:'Do you know the saying, \n"To lack nobility is \nto lack humanity"?<PAGE>Ah, but of course you wouldn't. \nYou lot have no education, \nafter all. Forgive me.'
00270223:'The lower caste continues \nto work fussily about today, \nI see. How miserable.'
00270224:'They say some commoners \nbroke into one of the \nnoble mansions. <PAGE>Isn't that just like \nthe poor? They lack \nconscience and dignity!'
00270225:'The pauper filth should be \nhappy to polish our boots. <PAGE>Not that I'd let a wretch \nlike you anywhere near \nmy boots, of course.'
00270226:'Ever busy, ever \nbare, they say. <PAGE>How fitting.'
00270227:'You lot can't survive \nwithout working so hard you \nliterally cough up blood, yes?<PAGE>Sorry, but I have so much \nfree time I don't even \nknow what to do with it.'
00270228:'The Empire may appear \npeaceful, but its foundations \nare shaking. <PAGE>We still don't have \na new emperor.'
00270229:'It's already been six months \nsince Krunos XIV passed on... <PAGE>There aren't even any hints \nas to who the next emperor \nmight be. It is most unusual.'
00270230:'Apparently the \naspirants for emperor \nare quite young. <PAGE>Even if it's too early to ascend \nto the throne, they could at least \nlet us know who the successor is.'
00270231:'I'm so worried with no \nsuccessor named yet... <PAGE>Who's going to take \ncommand if there were \na state of emergency?'
00270232:'There are rumors the Council \nand Imperial Knights are clashing \nover the new emperor. <PAGE>It seems they both have \nan aspirant they favor to \ntake over the throne.'
00270233:'The power balance between the \nCouncil and the Knights could change \ndepending on the next emperor. <PAGE>I just hope whoever ascends \nto the throne truly cares \nfor their subjects...'
00270234:'The barrier is...whirling around? \nWait, is that even the barrier? \nI've never seen such a strange sky.'
00270235:'Many people have \nleft Zaphias.<PAGE>But I've lived in this city \nso long, I'd never be \nable to just abandon it.'
00270236:'Dragons and phoenixes were \nflying over Zaphias... \nWhat were they doing? <PAGE>I was sure they'd come to \nattack us, but it seems \nthe barrier blocked them.'
00270237:'It looks like the \nbarrier has stabilized. \nThank heavens.'
00270238:'What is that in the sky...?'
00270239:'Was the problem with \nthe barrier an omen that the \nsky would become so strange?'
00270240:'Thanks to the efforts of \nthe Knights, the capital\nwon't be attacked by monsters.<PAGE>Everyone who ran away \nacted much too rashly.'
00270241:'Putting aside the matter of \nthat incident with the Commandant, \nwe need the Knights. <PAGE>That state of Zaphias right \nnow is proof of that.'
00270242:'What's wrong, son? Are you lost? \nZaphias is a huge city, after all. \nVisitors get lost all the time.<PAGE>The capital is \ndivided into \nthree areas.'
00270243:'This is the citizen quarter. To the \nsouth is the lower quarter, and up the \nstairs to the west is the royal quarter.<PAGE>The castle is north. You can get \nthere from the royal quarter. \nYou'll know it by the huge gate.'
00270244:'Y-you're...the \nwanted man!'
00270245:'Eeeyaaaah! \nD-don't kill me! \nYou can have all my money...'
00270246:'As long as we remain in \nZaphias there's nothing \nto fear from the monsters. <PAGE>We've got our barrier, \nand of course the Knights.'
00270247:'Zaphias is the safest \ncity in the world.'
00270248:'You see \nall the tents \nover there? <PAGE>They're the tents for \nthe morning market.'
00270249:'There are all \nkinds of vegetables \nand meats for sale. <PAGE>My mommy and daddy \nsell bread there too!'
00270250:'This morning I was \nhelping Mommy and Daddy. <PAGE>One of the customers \ncomplimented my pretty smile!'
00270251:'Everyone's says I'm \nlike the poster girl \nfor the market. <PAGE>What's a poster girl?'
00270252:'Welcome! \nYummy fresh-baked \nbread for sale!! <PAGE>Oh, sorry, I was just \npracticing. I don't actually \nhave any bread to sell.'
00270253:'Mommy and Daddy's \nbread is really tasty. \nCome and try it sometime!'
00270254:'I came to Zaphias\nhoping I could help \npeople, but... <PAGE>Now that I'm here, I don't \nreally know what to do.'
00270255:'I'm trying to find \nsomething I can help with. <PAGE>I suppose I'll have to \nmeet more people in \nthe capital first.'
00270256:'I helped hunt monsters \nin the town where \nI used to live. <PAGE>We had seasons when our \nbarrier would weaken and \nmonsters would get inside.'
00270257:'Here in Zaphias you have the \nImperial Knights, so I can't \neven help with defense...<PAGE>What else is there \nthat I can do?'
00270258:'Zaphias may be a nice place \nto live, but that means its \ntaxes are that much higher. <PAGE>Prices went up again recently...'
00270259:'I don't have a regular job, \nand getting by from day to day \nis eating up my savings.<PAGE>*Sigh* \nMaybe I should just \ngo back to Halure...'
00270260:'Something's wrong \nwith the barrier...<PAGE>No, wait. Is this...aer?'
00270261:'Why would so much aer suddenly \nbe flowing through Zaphias?<PAGE>It seems to be coming from \nthe castle... Could the source \nbe the barrier blastia...?'
00270262:'The city's still in chaos, and now \nof all times the knight guarding the \nramparts has to be that guy...'
00270263:'The knight usually guarding \nthe lower quarter is a \ndependable, loyal person. <PAGE>He's in the Schwann Brigade. The \nuseless ones are in the Cumore Brigade. \nThe commanders make the difference.'
00270264:'I'm helping the Knights \nfight the monsters. <PAGE>I did the same \njob in Halure, so I'm \nsure I'm some help.'
00270265:'I know using bodhi blastia \ncauses harmful effects, but we \ncan't think about that now.'
00270266:'Apparently the Knights \nprotecting the capital now \nare all pretty diligent guys. <PAGE>The worthless ones all \nran away a long time ago.'
00270267:'What kind of leadership did \nthe Knights have, anyway?<PAGE>With Commandant Alexei and all... \nI don't know what to think of \nthe Imperial Knights anymore.'
00270268:'The Imperial Knights \nare so cool!<PAGE>I'm gonna be \na Knight when \nI grow up!'
00270269:'I'll defend Zaphias! \nLeave it to me! <PAGE>Don't worry, \nI'll protect \nyou too!'
00270270:'Hey! \nI saw your face \non a poster! <PAGE>If I brought you to the \nKnights they'd give me a \nlot of Gald, wouldn't they?'
00270271:'I'm gonna haul you \nin and have the \nKnights hire me!'
00270272:'Did you hear? The Knights \nhave a new brigade: \nthe <STR>(FRE) Brigade!'
00270273:'I met <STR>(FRE) before he \nwas a captain, you know. \nHe's a really nice guy! <PAGE>When I join the Knights \nI'm gonna be in the <STR>(FRE) Brigade!'
00270274:'Salt, check. Sugar, check. Did\nI forget anything...? Ah, such \na lovely day for shopping.'
00270275:'Oh...are you from the \nlower quarter, young man? <PAGE>Tee-hee...what a handsome \nyoung figure. I got a bonus \nwith my shopping today!♪'
00270276:'Is it true the aque blastia \nin the lower quarter\nbroke? How terrible.'
00270277:'If you need water, \nbring some from \nthe citizen quarter.<PAGE>In troubled times we all \nhave to help each other out.'
00270278:'Hey, why don't you join the \n<STR>(FRE) Defense Force, too?<PAGE>Hee-hee.  I'm the founder \nof the <STR>(FRE) Defense \nForce, you know.'
00270279:'I've watched him for a while. \nI formed the Defense Force \nwhen he made captain. <PAGE>Our main activities are \nrooting for <STR>(FRE) and \ntalking with other members.'
00270280:'The barrier's gone! <PAGE>What'll happen if that strange \nmonster that showed up in \nthe sky attacks Zaphias...?'
00270281:'I pray they fix the \nbarrier blastia soon...'
00270282:'They say young <STR>(FRE) built a \nnew town in Hypionia.<PAGE>Will you be joining <STR>(FRE)\nthere, <STR>(YUR)?'
00270283:'I'd love to go myself, \nbut traveling so far \nat this age...'
00270284:'This is all the imperial \nfamily's fault. They neglected \ntheir duties as our guardians.'
00270285:'We can't forgive the \nimperial family. They should \nbe condemned for this.'
00270286:'All this trouble lately has \nserved to prove one thing. <PAGE>We don't need an emperor.'
00270287:'We, the nobles, will lead \nthe Empire from now on. <PAGE>The age of imperial \nautocracy is over.'
00270288:'The Knights are the sword of justice. \nThe shield of the weak. \nWe can retreat not a step.'
00270289:'We are all that stand before the citizens. \nWe shall protect Zaphias with our lives!'
00270290:'My orders are to protect \nthe capital and its citizens. <PAGE>No matter what may \nhappen outside, I \nmust fulfill my duty.'
00270291:'I can only trust that those \nwho left the city will deal with \nwhatever is happening outside.'
00270292:'Damn... I sure pulled the \nshort end of the stick. <PAGE>I can't believe \nI have to guard \nthe lower quarter...'
00270293:'The lower quarter\nis even further out \nthan the ramparts. <PAGE>This is bad. \nIt's the worst \nplace for a battle.'
00270294:'<STR>(FRE) helped \nevacuate a lot of \nresidents from the city. <PAGE>Most of the lower \nquarter stayed, though. \nThey said they'd never leave.'
00270295:'<STR>(FRE) asked us to take care of \nthe lower quarter, so he must plan \non coming back eventually.'
00270296:'Aaaah! This is it! \nIt's the end!<PAGE>Even the Knights can't \nbeat that thing!'
00270297:'That monster's \ngonna devour us!'
00270298:'There was a huge \nearthquake to the north!<PAGE>This is it. The end of the world... \nIt doesn't matter if a monster eats you \nor the world ends. It's all the same!'
00270299:'I hope when the world \nends, it happens so fast \nwe don't even notice.<PAGE>I don't want \nit to hurt...'
00270300:'Hey, are the \nKnights bad guys?'
00270301:'Everyone's saying \nthe capital going all crazy \nis Alexei's fault.<PAGE>What a letdown...'
00270302:'Did you hear about the \nnew town Captain <STR>(FRE)\nbuilt in Hypionia? <PAGE>I wanna go live in \nCaptain <STR>(FRE)'s town...'
00270303:'I'm gonna go to the new town \nand have Captain <STR>(FRE)\nteach me how to use a sword! <PAGE>I'm gonna be a knight just \nlike Captain <STR>(FRE)!'
00270304:'Th-th-th-the barrier \ndisappeared! <PAGE>Monsters are going to attack! \n How come we have \nto stay in the city?!'
00270305:'If we don't run, we'll die! \nWe have to abandon Zaphias!'
00270306:'This lull in monster attacks is \nonly temporary. <PAGE>It's so obvious they'll be back to \nattack again in a huge swarm!'
00270307:'It's all over, it's all over! \nThe capital! My life!\nOhhh... <PAGE>Why did I ever \nbecome a knight...'
00270308:'Only nobles and royalty are \nfit to be on this level.<PAGE>It's not really a \nplace for people from \nthe lower quarter.'
00270309:'I can't really say anything, \nthough. I was raised in the \nlower quarter, too.<PAGE>Being up here really \nmakes me miss the \nwarmth of the lower quarter...'
00270310:'It's almost overwhelming \nhow large the castle is \nwhen you're this close.'
00270311:'The barrier blastia's \npretty huge, too. So big, it \nkind of numbs your senses.'
00270312:'Ahead is \nZaphias Castle.'
00270313:'Nighttime entry \nis not permitted.'
00270314:'Ahead is \nZaphias Castle.'
00270315:'There's a suspicious person! \nArrest him immediately!'
00270316:'This is the heart \nof the Empire. <PAGE>If you want to get in, you \neither have to be an Imperial Knight \nor be caught as a criminal. '
00270317:'Why are you loitering in \nfront of the castle at this hour? \nDo you want to get arrested?'
00270318:'This is the hope of the \nEmpire, Zaphias Castle. <PAGE>We, the Imperial Knights, have \nguarded the fire of hope through \nwind and rain. Well, sort of. '
00270319:'I'm not impressed \nthat you've brought along \nchildren at this hour. <PAGE>You'll be suspected \nof kidnapping. '
00270320:'Up ahead is the royal quarter.'
00270321:'What is a \nnon-noble doing here \nat this hour? <PAGE>You're not the thief that \neveryone's talking about?'
00270322:'Up ahead is the royal quarter.'
00270323:'Don't stand behind me. <PAGE>I cannot ensure your life \nif you stand behind me. '
00270324:'The only reason you can walk \naround at night is because of the \nstreet light blastia. <PAGE>We also benefit from \nbarrier blastia and aque \nblastia in Zaphias. '
00270325:'Appointments to the \nemperor's advisory body are \ndetermined by our committee... <PAGE>But I really haven't \ndone much.'
00270326:'The entire council \nhas been bad mouthed and is in \nchaos due to a certain magistrate, <PAGE>even though I'm \nsuch a good person...'
00270327:'I heard that his accomplice \ninterfered with the core \nof Zaphias's blastia. <PAGE>Handling the blastia \nwithout the proper knowledge \ncould lead to disaster. '
00270328:'The Commadant barricaded \nin the castle is the \nsource of the problem. <PAGE>We councilors were also \noverrun by the Knights \nand chased to the castle. '
00270329:'You'll be punished for \nmishandling the blastia. <PAGE>Do you think the Commandant \nwill be all right?'
00270330:'What's going on? It looked \nlike the Sword Stair formula \nshot something really far away.'
00270331:'I can't stand the abuse \nthe blastia are taking... <PAGE>We're the ones that \ndetermine who gets \nblastia and who doesn't.'
00270332:'The path we're on will be \ndestroyed... It's too late. \nThere is no other way.'
00270333:'The appearance of the \nAdephagos is a countdown \nto destruction. <PAGE>The history of \nKritya shows this. '
00270334:'The thing that appeared to \nthe north looks like the \ntop floor of the tower. <PAGE>We can't construct such a high \ntower with today's technology.'
00270335:'Is that tower from \nthe Geraios Civilization...? <PAGE>But what for...?'
00270336:'Hey! Could you please \nnot suddenly disturb me?!'
00270337:'I've been on the lookout, \nwatching the mansion to \nconfirm the rumors. <PAGE>I'll immediately call \nfor the knights if a thief \nenters the premises.'
00270338:'Hey! Could you please \nnot suddenly disturb me?!'
00270339:'I succeeded in \nreporting to the knights \nthe other day. <PAGE>I've been \non the lookout \nfor any thieves. '
00270340:'I think the poor are causing \ntoo much of an uproar just because \ntheir taxes have increased a little. <PAGE>I guess those slow-witted people \nthat can't even put their assets \nto use have no choice.'
00270341:'If you can't buy \nbread, just eat cake. <PAGE>It's so sad that something \nas simple as that \ndoesn't get around.'
00270342:'D-d-don't scare \nme like that...'
00270343:'Naturally, you would come \nto say hello when you're moving \ninto the neighbourhood. <PAGE>I'm waiting here ready \nto give you advice. '
00270344:'I'm on the watch \nwith the lady next door \nto look out for thieves'
00270345:'I heard there's a reward \nfor finding thieves. <PAGE>It's just 10,000 Gald, but \nI guess money is money.'
00270346:'Recently, a lot of poor people \nhave been trying garner sympathy \nby bringing their pets.'
00270347:'I won't fall for your sob \nstory about your dog. '
00270348:'You've been sitting around \nuntil this late hour... \nOh well...'
00270349:'You came to \ndemand water, right? \nAre you statisfied? <PAGE>What a shameless man.'
00270350:'If the poor loiter around \nhere, they'll be arrested \nby the Knights. <PAGE>Well, I'm the one \nthat'll notify them. '
00270351:'I'll accept the commotion caused \nby the thieves during the afternoon \nthe other day as dignified. <PAGE>On the other hand, \nI think those who sneak \nin at night as vulgar.'
00270352:'You've been sitting around \nuntil this late hour... \nOh well...'
00270353:'You came to \ndemand water, right? \nAre you statisfied? <PAGE>What a shameless man.'
00270354:'You've been sitting around \nuntil this late hour... \nOh well...'
00270355:'You can at least \ngo around groveling \nto gather coins.'
00270356:'People say it's dangerous \nto go walking alone at night, \nbut it's hard to resist. <PAGE>Moonlight strolls... \nAhhh, so beautiful. '
00270357:'Look around at the capital\nat night, and you can just \nfeel the peace and quiet.'
00270358:'You're collecting \nGald at this hour? <PAGE>I've heard that Gald is easier \nto find at night since the city \nlights shine off the coins. '
00270359:'The tourists that come \nto see the capital throw \nGald into that lake.'
00270360:'I saw the dragon \nwhen there were problems \nwith the capital's aer. <PAGE>That was probably \nan Entelexeia.'
00270361:'I wonder if that dragon came \nto eat the capital's aer. '
00270362:'I saw someone that looked \nlike the Commandant of the \nKnights leaving the city. <PAGE>He flew away!'
00270363:'What really happened \nin the castle?'
00270364:'I see you a lot, but you \ndon't really work in the \nroyal quarter, do you?'
00270365:'There will be no looting. \nDo you hear me? '
00270366:'Is that tower a hand of salvation \nfrom the heavens, or a \nhammer borne of the earth? <PAGE>Heh heh. \nI'm a pretty good \npoet, aren't I?'
00270367:'Is that a tower of \nhope or depair?'
00270368:'It's like those people in \nthe underworld are crowded \ninto a little, tiny hole. <PAGE>Ahh. \nI want to crush \nthem so badly...'
00270369:'Squish... <PAGE>Well, just kidding.'
00270370:'The underworld \nis newer than \nthe royal quarter. <PAGE>They may have status \nnow, but they were nothing \na few generations back.'
00270371:'We'll soon have to put \nthem in their place. <PAGE>We should make that clear. \nJust a few squishes...'
00270372:'A thief entered the mansion \nduring the evacuation! <PAGE>It was a looter, I'm telling \nyou! I can't let that go!'
00270373:'Do not disrupt \nthe guards. <PAGE>They'll arrest any thief that \nuses the chaos with the destroyed \nbarrier to try something funny. '
00270374:'The knights barricaded \nthere aren't listening \nto anyone! <PAGE>They only provide half-hearted \nanswers and have no intension \nof responding properly.'
00270375:'What in the world? \nThey're tax thieves!'
00270376:'There were a few things \nmissing when I vacated \nthe mansion for a while. <PAGE>A thief must \nhave broken in.'
00270377:'I'll give up on the stolen goods. \nI don't think the Knights \nhave time for that. <PAGE>That would only matter \nif you were alive. '
00270378:'Actually, the ladies here followed \nthat knight for an entire day \nand have not stopped complaining. <PAGE>The Knights are \ngreatly worried... \nI feel sorry for them. '
00270379:'Keep this conversation a secret \nfrom the other ladies.'

00270384:'Huh? \nWhat about \nyour blastia? <PAGE>I don't care \nabout blastia. \nDon't waste my time.'
00270385:'I'm telling you, \nI don't know anything \nabout blastia.<PAGE>If your blastia broke, \njust buy a new one!'
00270386:'I've got a serious problem. \nDon't bother me.'
00270387:'I'm trying to figure out what to \ndo with all my money. I have more \nthan I know what to do with. <PAGE>Huh? You want some? Show me \nyour best antlionz impression \nand just I might consider it.'
00270388:'Just look at the low folk \nmiserably crawling about \nin the muck again today. <PAGE>Don't you wish you could \ncrush them beneath your heel?'
00270389:'They wear filthy rags and \neat garbage. An absolutely \ndreadful existence! <PAGE>If I got thrown into the \nlower quarter, I'd lose \nmy sanity in two minutes.'
00270390:'I bet if I tossed down a few Gald \nfrom here I could get them all to \nmake a mad scramble for it!<PAGE>How I'd like to try...'
00270391:'Look at that pack of \nhyenas down there. \nDisgusting!'
00270392:'Zaphias' barrier has disappeared! \nIt must be repaired immediately!'
00270393:'Researchers from Aspio\nmust be summoned to fix the \nbarrier blastia at once!'
00270394:'There was a giant earthquake! \nThe shock came from the north!'
00270395:'Thanks to that nasty earthquake, \nall my elegant furniture and \ncrockery is smashed!<PAGE>Who do I sue \nfor damages?!'
00270396:'I came back to Zaphias\nbecause I heard it was safe. <PAGE>But the barrier has \ndisappeared, and there's \na monster in the sky.'
00270397:'Will that beast be in the sky \nno matter where we run? <PAGE>Perhaps Zaphias is \nthe safest place. \nWe have the Knights here.'
00270398:'A long, thin structure \nappeared to the north. <PAGE>It's so tall it pierces the clouds. \nI wonder how far it goes...? \nYou can't see the top.'
00270399:'How could such a gigantic \nthing have been built?'
00270400:'I knew it. The capital's \nback to normal. It's because \nwe nobles are well-protected.'
00270401:'I'm not worried about \nmonsters or the barrier.<PAGE>Why? Because the \nnobles are protected!'
00270402:'First that hideous monster, \nnow a strange tower. \nAnything can happen...'

00270678:'I traveled all the way here \nto see the flowers...\nI'm glad it wasn't a waste.'
00270679:'I wonder when the best \ntime for flower viewing is?'
00270680:'What do the Knights \nwant in Halure?'
00270681:'I doubt they came \nfor flower viewing!'
00270682:'The flowers bloom, then fall... \nYear after year, the same cycle.'

00270693:'We had taken the Tree of Halure\nfor granted. But now, we must \nbe more thankful for it.'
00270694:'The Tree of Halure may seem static, \nbut in fact it grew little by little \ninto the towering giant it is.'
00270695:'We are the same. \nLittle by little, day by \nday, we grow as well.'
00270696:'Can't we repair the \nblastia somehow?'
00270697:'At this rate, the town will \nbe overrun by monsters...'
00270698:'I'm so relieved the \nblastia was repaired.'
00270699:'The people of this town \ncare for the Tree deeply.'
00270700:'It may be a blastia, but that \ndoesn't mean it's permanent.'
00270701:'I ask you folk to care \nfor the Tree as well.'

00270718:'Even the mighty Tree \nof Halure isn't immortal.'
00270719:'We're all the same. \nWe're all alive.'

00270733:'Thankfully, the Tree of \nHalure does that for us.'
00270734:'Grandpa says the Tree \nof Halure was around even \nwhen he was a little boy...'
00270735:'I wonder how long \nthe Tree's been here?'
00270736:'A bunch of dirty \npeople came to town.<PAGE>Is that what \nthey call "refugees"?'
00270737:'I wish they'd \nall just leave.'
00270738:'I think the flowers are beautiful \nbecause they bloom with every \nlast ounce of their strength.'
00270739:'I hope I can be as \nbeautiful as these \nflowers some day.'
00270740:'I think the flowers are so \nbeautiful because they're silent.'
00270741:'I wish people could \nbe the same way...'
00270742:'Our town, Halure...no, the Tree of Halure\ngrew as large as it did by \nsimply accepting all that transpires.<PAGE>And I am sure it will \ncontinue to do so.'
00270743:'I think the trick to living is \nto accept what comes, \nno matter what it may be.'
00270744:'Are you afraid of \nbeing hurt? So am I.<PAGE>But look at the Tree of \nHalure...can't you feel something?'

00270761:'It has been some time since \nwe last had human visitors.'
00270762:'You people came from outside, \ndidn't you? I could tell right away. \nI know everybody in this town.'

00270764:'Well, if it isn't <STR>(JUD)! \nIt's been a while! \nHow are you?'
00270765:'How many years has it been \nsince you've been back in \nMyorzo? Not that it matters.'
00270766:'The monster in the sky isn't the \nsame one on the ancient relief \nwe have here in Myorzo, is it?'
00270767:'Myorzo is protected by an \nEntelexeia. We'll be safe \nno matter what happens.'
00270768:'I-I'm not scared \nof that thing! \nHmph!'
00270769:'We're not gonna be eaten \nby that monster, right?'
00270770:'I can't believe the image \nof the Adephagos on our \nrelief became reality...'
00270771:'Should we Kritya \njust stay hiding \ninside Myorzo?'
00270772:'Welcome to Myorzo. \nThings certainly seem \ntumultuous outside.'
00270773:'Of course, it doesn't \nhave anything to do \nwith us living here.'
00270774:'There's such a commotion \noutside. Do something \nabout it. Please.'
00270775:'This is just my opinion, but the \ngiant building that erupted from \nthe ground is very suspicious.'
00270776:'There's nothing in any of \nour lore that mentions \nsuch a massive construction.'
00270777:'There must be something \nwe can do, too.'
00270778:'Hmm? Oh, you're the people \nthat came from outside? \nHow boring. You're so...normal.'
00270779:'*Sigh* \nI can't believe you people \nstill use blastia...'
00270780:'Well, well... \nSo you're the humans? \nIt's nice to meet you.'
00270781:'We may not look the same, but \nI suppose humans and Krityans \nreally aren't all that different.'
00270782:'Did you know \nthere's another Kritya \ntown besides Myorzo?'
00270783:'What? The town on Temza\nwas destroyed? Oh my...'
00270784:'Nothing good comes \nfrom using blastia.'
00270785:'You people \nbetter take care \nof that monster.'
00270786:'I think that beast \nmay be the Adephagos \ndepicted on the relief...'
00270787:'I wonder how they \nmanaged to defeat the \nAdephagos in the past.'
00270788:'Aren't the people down \non the surface afraid of \nthe monster in the sky?'
00270789:'Will that thing \nalways be up \nthere now?'
00270790:'Can blastia really \nbe used to brighten \nup the night?'
00270791:'If we used blastia to \nbrighten up the night, when \nwould we be able to sleep?'
00270792:'Nothing good comes \nfrom using blastia.'
00270793:'You people \nbetter take care \nof that monster.'
00270794:'This town will always \nbe safe as long as \nwe have the Entelexeia.'
00270795:'I don't like the \nsky like this. \nNot at all.'
00270796:'Hey, is it true you humans \nactually use blastia?'
00270797:'My grandpa said \nhis grandpa told him \nblastia were no good.'
00270798:'Why don't you people \nuse your blastia to \nkill that monster?'
00270799:'What's the point of having \nblastia if you don't use \nthem at a time like this?'
00270800:'If you guys won't take \ncare of the Adephagos I'll \ntake it out myself!'
00270801:'The Adephagos is \nnothing compared to me.'
00270802:'What are you doing \nloitering around at a time \nlike this, <STR>(JUD)? <PAGE>You really haven't changed. '

00270806:'Why don't you come back, \n<STR>(JUD)? Doesn't the \nhuman world tire you out? <PAGE>That's what Tort\nsaid when he came \nback a while ago. '
00270807:'To think this city, without \nblastia, is easier to live in than \nthe human world. How strange...'
00270808:'Good evening. \nPlease take your time.'

00270813:'I'm sure the \nelder is inside.'
00270814:'Did you see the relief in the \nelder's house? Doesn't it look \nlike the monster in the sky?'
00270815:'I'm sure the \nelder is inside.'
00270816:'Did you see the relief in the \nelder's house? Doesn't it look \nlike the monster in the sky?'

00270825:'And what might bring \nyou here at this late hour?'
00270826:'Youngsters these days just have \nno appreciation for the magnificence \nof the legendary cucumber.'
00270827:'And what might bring \nyou here at this late hour?'
00270828:'I've said to myself that \nno night can last forever, \nbut perhaps I spoke too soon.'
00270829:'I never imagined the day would \ncome when I would see the \nAdephagos with my own eyes...'
00270830:'I suppose this is no time \nfor talk of legendary cucumbers...'
00270831:'Is that the beast shown \nour ancient relief?'
00270832:'How did people in \nancient times manage to \nsubdue the Adephagos?'

00270834:'Hey, you. \nGet rid of that \nmonster already.'
00270835:'We Kritya should be \nable to do something...'

00271089:'Stop by any time... '
00271090:'Hey, what do you think? \nTake a look. Turned into \nquite a town, hasn't it? '

00271210:'The Empire has it \npretty rough, too.'
00271211:'Business? Now? The sky is like \nthis all over the entire world, \nright? So it's not safe anywhere?'

00271244:'Wh-why isn't the barrier \nblastia working?!'
00271245:'I just don't know \nabout those Knights. \nThey sure were late.'
00271246:'We really need the \nDon in this town.'
00271247:'Say, did you hear? \nThat cool knight \ngot arrested!'
00271248:'Kind of a shame. \nHe looked so cool...'
00271249:'Barbos made plenty of \ntrouble for this inn, too.'
00271250:'He finally showed \nhis true colors.'

00271261:'The Don... \nThose eyes... \nThey're the eyes of resolution...'
00271262:'The Don... \nI thought this day would \ncome sooner or later...'
00271263:'The poor Don... \nIt's gonna be lonely \naround here.'
00271264:'Our young people will \nreally have to get their \nacts together now.'
00271265:'It sounds like things \ncould get ugly over in \nthe Empire, doesn't it?'
00271266:'Of course, I'd welcome anything\nthat weakened the Empire.'
00271267:'Getting attacked by a huge \npack of monsters right after \narriving, huh... Having fun yet?'
00271268:'Getting attacked by a huge \npack of monsters right after \narriving, huh... Having fun yet?'
00271269:'You say the Empire is coming \nto attack? Well, well. That's \nnot very peaceful at all, is it?'
00271270:'You say the Empire is coming \nto attack? Well, well. That's \nnot very peaceful at all, is it?'
00271271:'That Ragou was quite \na scoundrel, wasn't he?'
00271272:'Just thinking about \nhow he lived so comfortably \nmakes my guts churn.'
00271273:'There's no way \nwe can make nice \nwith the Empire!'
00271274:'It'd be fine if they were \nall as nice as that young \nknight who was here before.'
00271275:'What on earth is going on?'
00271276:'I don't understand \nanything anymore!'
00271277:'What on earth is going on?'
00271278:'I don't understand \nanything anymore!'
00271279:'We will keep the peace \nhere in Dahngrest.'
00271280:'We will keep the peace at \nnight here in Dahngrest.'
00271281:'I can't believe monsters \nwould show up in town... \nI bet the Empire's behind it.'
00271282:'The barrier failed!\nThis is a disaster!'
00271283:'The only reason we managed to \nget out of that mess with minimum \nlosses is our Union's leadership.'
00271284:'The Don is a great man.'
00271285:'The Empire is supposedly \ngoing to attack. We need \nto tighten up security.'
00271286:'We need to tighten \nup security.'
00271287:'That damn Barbos... \nI'll never forgive him.'
00271288:'I'd never forgive anyone \nwho violated this town.'
00271289:'After Barbos was taken \ncare of, this town got \na lot more peaceful.'
00271290:'I'm just glad Dahngrest is \nback to its good, old self.'
00271291:'If only we could sign a treaty \nof friendship with the Empire,\nwork would be so much simpler.'
00271292:'The day my job gets easy \nis the day we're at peace.'
00271293:'The Empire isn't our only \nenemy! We can't forget \nabout the monsters.'
00271294:'But can anyone really hope\nto defeat that thing...?'
00271295:'Something is giving me \na very bad feeling... \nWhat's going to happen?'
00271296:'For some reason, \nbad feelings always \nseem to come true.'
00271297:'I never even thought \nabout what might happen \nif the Don died.'
00271298:'If we had just done \nour job a little better...'
00271299:'The Don's dead now...\nZaphias can go to \nhell for all I care.'
00271300:'I hope the Empire\nloses its center and \ncompletely collapses.'
00271301:'Things sure are lively. All thanks \nto the Don and the Union... \nNo no, I'm just talking to myself!'
00271302:'Boss Barbos would have \nmy head if heard me saying \nanything nice about the Don.'
00271303:'This ain't good at all! \nThe smart thing to \ndo would be to run!'
00271304:'This ain't good at all! \nThe smart thing to \ndo would be to run!'
00271305:'Well that was a surprise! \nGuess things like this \nreally do happen...'
00271306:'No, no...I didn't run! \nWe fought all proper-like. \nMe too! Seriously!'
00271307:'They should just hurry \nup and kill all the \nknights they captured!<PAGE>...Wh-what, you got a \nproblem with that...?'
00271308:'...Wh-what, you got \na problem with that...?'
00271309:'Look, it's not \nlike I'm a Barbos\nfan or anything...'
00271310:'S-seriously, I'm not!'
00271311:'With Barbos dead,\nthe Blood Alliance\nis finished...'
00271312:'Jobs are gonna get \nscarce without the Blood \nAlliance around anymore...'
00271313:'We're supposed to be friendly\nwith the Empire now? No way!'
00271314:'What, are we all supposed hold \nhands with the Knights and \nplay pattycake? What a joke!'
00271315:'This ain't just bad... It's \nreally bad! Nothing to do but \nmake a break for it again!'
00271316:'This ain't just bad... It's \nreally bad! Nothing to do but \nmake a break for it again!'
00271317:'Just being in this town makes \nme feel like I'm going to get \nwrapped up in something bad.'
00271318:'It might be smart to wait \nfor the right time and just \nget away from this town.'
00271319:'First Barbos, \nnow the Don?'
00271320:'Just think about it... \nThe heads of two of the five \nmaster guilds are dead.'
00271321:'What's going\nto happen now?'
00271322:'What am I supposed to do?'
00271323:'I'm at my wits' end.'
00271324:'Someone do something!'
00271325:'It doesn't matter where \nwe run anymore...'
00271326:'Someone do something!'
00271327:'Hey, you don't think the \nworld's going to be destroyed \nor anything, do you?'
00271328:'Damn! What are we \nsupposed to do about \nthat thing in the sky?'
00271329:'Hey, you don't think the \nworld's going to be destroyed \nor anything, do you?'
00271330:'Damn! What are we \nsupposed to do about \nthat thing in the sky?'
00271331:'I've been on a traveling to find \npowerful monsters, but the tornado to \nthe north has stopped my progress.'
00271332:'There's nothing one man can \ndo about that tornado. It's \nunfortunate, but can't be helped.'
00271333:'The monsters' numbers count \nfor nothing! We shall rout \nthem and drive them back!!'
00271334:'The monsters' numbers count \nfor nothing! We shall rout \nthem and drive them back!!'
00271335:'Those monsters... They looked \nlike the ones I fought in Keiv \nMoc... I wonder why...'

00271337:'First monsters... Now \nthe Empire... \nHow pathetic...'
00271338:'First monsters... Now \nthe Empire... \nHow pathetic...'
00271339:'I have no interest \nin peoples' squabbles.'
00271340:'The chief would say \nthe same thing. \nNo interest at all.'
00271341:'Ragou? \nHmph, I could care \nless about him.<PAGE>So what if a guy like \nthat falls from power? \nI don't feel a thing.'
00271342:'Isn't there a monster out there \nthat can move the heart \nmore than a human?'
00271343:'So... What monsters should \nI go hunting next? <PAGE>I'll think about it tonight.'
00271344:'Hmm... Maybe I \nshould rejoin the \nchief and his men.'
00271345:'I gotta hurry and \ntell the chief about \nthat monster.'
00271346:'Monsters are evil.\nThe Hunting Blades\nexist to hunt them.'
00271347:'I hear the chief and \nhis men did quite a \njob in Nordopolica.'
00271348:'Apparently they took out \nall the monsters there.'
00271349:'I may have no interest in \npeoples' squabbles, but the \ndeath of the Don is heavy...'
00271350:'Maybe I'll go out hunt to \ntake my mind off things.'
00271351:'They say something \nhappened in Zaphias, but it \nhas nothing to do with me.'
00271352:'I guess I'll go fulfill the duty \nof the Hunting Blades.'
00271353:'The monsters are restless. \nI wonder if it's because of \nthe monster in the sky?'
00271354:'Sky, land, whatever. \nI'll take on all the \nvicious monsters.'
00271355:'Even in times like these, \nwe can't keep from \nhunting monsters.<PAGE>It's fate, I tell ya.'
00271356:'Monster are evil. Dangerous. \nWe must eradicate them \nat all costs.'
00271357:'I'm glad the Don can keep this \nplace lively, but I wish we'd just \ngo take out the Empire already.'
00271358:'Surely Barbos will \nstand against them...'
00271359:'What a great chance \nto show the world \nwhat a guild can do!'
00271360:'If we take care of this before the \nDon gets his chance to show off, \neveryone will know our strength!'
00271361:'Damn the Don\nand his antics!'
00271362:'At this rate, we could even \ntake on the Empire...'
00271363:'Now we can finally take on those \nidiots from the Empire. We'll \nshow them a thing or two.'
00271364:'Now we can finally take on those \nidiots from the Empire. We'll \nshow them a thing or two.'
00271365:'Damn it! What do guildsmen\nthink they're doing fighting \nagainst each other?!'
00271366:'The Empire is the enemy!'
00271367:'Heh, so the mighty Don\npasses away... I won't get \nmy share of excitement.'
00271368:'The Don's weak. \nNow Dahngrest's \ngonna get boring.'
00271369:'Who the hell would \nsupport a treaty \nwith the Empire?'
00271370:'The Don is weak.'
00271371:'If Barbos was still alive, \nhe'd take that thing down \nbefore you could blink.'
00271372:'What the hell does the \nDon think he's doing?'
00271373:'I hear Palestralle has \nmade their move.'
00271374:'Heh...things are going \nto get interesting.'
00271375:'I hate the way the \nDon does things. \nThis ain't right.'
00271376:'Damn it! \nWhy are all the \nstrong men dying?'
00271377:'If the Empire tries to muscle in,\nthere's no way the Union as it \nis now can stand up to them.'
00271378:'I wonder how long \nDahngrest will hold...'
00271379:'Hey! Whaddaya think you're \ndoin' just wanderin' around?'
00271380:'Well?! You got a \nproblem, buddy?!'
00271381:'Th-the barrier broke?! \nThat's impossible!! \nIs the Empire behind this?!'
00271382:'Well?! You got a \nproblem, buddy?!'
00271383:'Hey! Whaddaya think you're \ndoin' just wanderin' around?'
00271384:'Well?! You got a \nproblem, buddy?!'
00271385:'Yo, buddy! \nYou sure you ain't an \nEmpire spy? Huh?!'
00271386:'Well?! You got a \nproblem, buddy?!'
00271387:'The Blood Alliance\nshould just take over \nthe Union already.'
00271388:'And then make mincemeat \nout of the Empire!'
00271389:'Hey! Whaddaya think you're \ndoin' just wanderin' around?'
00271390:'Well?! You got a \nproblem, buddy?!'
00271391:'A treaty of friendship? \nAre you crazy?'
00271392:'Ain't nobody getting \nfriendly with the Empire'
00271393:'I'm tough, but that \nthing scares even me.'
00271394:'Not that it \nwould beat me in \na fight, mind you.'
00271395:'Is it true\nBelius died?'
00271396:'Not that I really care.'
00271397:'The Don is dead. \nHah hah... I get it. \nI'm dreaming...'
00271398:'I just don't know...'
00271399:'Hey! Whaddaya think you're \ndoin' just wanderin' around?'
00271400:'Well?! You got a \nproblem, buddy?!'
00271401:'Come on, give me a break... \nThis is just crazy.'
00271402:'If nothing else, we gotta \nprotect Dahngrest.'
00271403:'Come on, give me a break... \nThis is just crazy.'
00271404:'If nothing else, we gotta \nprotect Dahngrest.'
00271405:'It's times like this I wish \nthe Don and Barbos\nwere still with us...'
00271406:'I wonder how long \nDahngrest will hold...'
00271407:'Hmph, I guess \nwe got no choice \nbut to cooperate.<PAGE>But I wonder how \nlong that'll last.'
00271408:'Well, we'll just \nhave to do \nwhat we can.'
00271409:'Be careful. \nThe brighter the light, \nthe darker the shadows.'
00271410:'Don't go walking into any alleys. \nDon't whine if you get yourself \nkilled... That's Dahngrest.'
00271411:'Well, well. \nIt's nice the guild\nfolks all fired up.'
00271412:'Monsters aren't my style. \nPeople are.'
00271413:'We take the barriers for granted, \nbut when you think about it \nthey're pretty incredible.'
00271414:'They're so much a part of \nour lives that nobody thinks \ntoo hard about them, but...'
00271415:'Human marks. \nThat's where we come in.'
00271416:'Human marks. \nThat's where we come in.'
00271417:'The Don, or Barbos. \nWonder who I should \nwork for...?'
00271418:'It doesn't really matter, \nas long as I get paid.'
00271419:'If only I could kill Ragou\nwith my own hands.'
00271420:'You'd be surprised how many folks \nthere are that some people wouldn't \nmind seeing disappear...'
00271421:'You say that Ragou's \nas good as free?<PAGE>I swear, everyone and \neverything is rotten. \n...I bet you are too.'
00271422:'Right now, the only people \ninnocent enough to face the \nheavens are small children.'
00271423:'Those monsters are divine \npunishment to humans \nfor the reckless behavior.<PAGE>It's too late to \nregret it now.'
00271424:'Now, for good people \nlike me, it's time to \nget out of here.'
00271425:'I heard Ragou\nturned up dead.<PAGE>The Union put a bounty \non him, but I guess \nsomeone got to him first.'
00271426:'Karma makes the world \ngo 'round, I guess.'
00271427:'Things are bad...<PAGE>But this is my chance \nto make some money...'
00271428:'But I have no obligations \nto the Union.<PAGE>Mercenaries will fight for \nwhoever pays us best.'
00271429:'Hey, what's going on? \nWhat's everyone doing here?<PAGE>A battle with \nPalestralle could start \nany minute, you know.'
00271430:'If you keep just hanging \naround, their people are \ngonna take the town!'
00271431:'I came here with my \nhusband, but I had no idea \nthis was such a large town.'
00271432:'This place really \nhas a different energy \nthan Zaphias.'
00271433:'Wh-what are the Knights doing? \nTh-they told us to run, but \nwhere are we supposed to go?'
00271434:'Grrr! \nWhere has my idiot of a \nhusband run off to?'
00271435:'That really was something! \nWhat a city! The citizens \ndefend it all by themselves.'
00271436:'And that man, the one \nthey call "the Don"... \nWow...'
00271437:'Wh-what shall we do?\nIf we stay in this town any longer,\nwe're going to be in danger.'
00271438:'Wh-what shall we do?\nIf we stay in this town any longer,\nwe're going to be in danger.'
00271439:'Wh-what shall we do?\nIf we stay in this town any longer,\nwe're going to be in danger.'
00271440:'Wh-what shall we do?\nIf we stay in this town any longer,\nwe're going to be in danger.'
00271441:'Things have finally quieted \ndown here... Unlike Zaphias, this \nis quite a down-and-dirty town.'
00271442:'It can be tiring staying \nin an unfamilar place.'
00271443:'Things have finally quieted \ndown here... Unlike Zaphias, this \nis quite a down-and-dirty town.'
00271444:'It can be tiring staying \nin an unfamilar place.'
00271445:'What is that?! What's \ngoing on in this city?!'
00271446:'What is that?! What's \ngoing on in this city?!'
00271447:'The people here \nare nervous. \nWhat is it now?'
00271448:'It's just one thing after \nanother in this town.'
00271449:'Now everyone's \nstrangely quiet... \nI wonder what happened...'
00271450:'It's just one thing after \nanother in this town.'
00271451:'Oh my... Are things all \nright back in Zaphias?'
00271452:'My son and his wife \nare still there...'

00271455:'Oh my... Are things all \nright back in Zaphias?'
00271456:'My son and his wife \nare still there...'
00271457:'In the end, the Don was \njust another person.<PAGE>He was not superhuman. \nHe was not immortal.'
00271458:'There was no \none who could kill \nthat old man after all.<PAGE>The only one who \ncould kill the Don was \nthe Don himself.'
00271459:'I wonder who ended \nup killing Ragou?<PAGE>He was mine. I should \nkill whoever it was \nthat took my prize.'
00271460:'Ragou only got what \nwas coming to him\nsooner or later.'
00271461:'I have no idea what \ncan be done to defeat \nthe evil in this world.'
00271462:'There's no clear \nline between what's \ngood and what's evil.'
00271463:'I don't know what \nthe line is between \ngood and evil.<PAGE>But destroying the world \ncrosses way over that line.'
00271464:'Are you ready \nto take a stand \nagainst evil?'
00271465:'I live in this city \nand help out with \nvarious guild jobs.'
00271466:'I love being able to \ninteract with so many \ndifferent people.'
00271467:'I-I have lived in this town \nfor many a year, but I have \nnever seen the barrier fail!!'
00271468:'B-but this town is my \ntown! I-I shall strive to \nprotect it with my life!'
00271469:'I am so pleased the \nbarrier is back in operation! \nNow we can rest easy.'
00271470:'I am so pleased the \nbarrier is back in operation! \nNow we can rest easy.'
00271471:'Of course they're angry here. \nThis town was built by people \nwronged by the Empire.'
00271472:'Of course they're angry here. \nThis town was built by people \nwronged by the Empire.'
00271473:'Fights even happen between \nthe guilds themselves.'
00271474:'Why do people fight...?'
00271475:'Things here in Dahngrest\nare finally back to normal.'
00271476:'I love this city.'
00271477:'I love it when this \ncity's filled with people's \nlaughter and voices.<PAGE>The fighting has \nstopped and things \nhave calmed down.'
00271478:'I'm so glad that \npeace has returned...'
00271479:'A lot of things have \nhappened in this city.<PAGE>It just goes to show \nthat life's not all \nfun and games.'
00271480:'Life's not always fun. \nThat is the biggest \ndilemma with living.'
00271481:'Everyone's worried \nthat people will start \nfighting each other again.'
00271482:'Whose blood will flow...? \nHow much this time...?'
00271483:'I knew of no other \nman like the Don.\nIt's such a great loss.'
00271484:'It's such a great loss.\nDon... Rest in peace...'
00271485:'I believe the blastia brought \nabout the catastrophe \nZaphias is facing.'
00271486:'Is the aer going \nout of control? \nWhat's going on?'
00271487:'Wait... That monster \nin the sky... Is that \nthing made of...aer...?'
00271488:'How could that...?'
00271489:'A monster made of aer... \nI feel like I've heard that story \nlong ago someplace...'
00271490:'I never could have \nimagined something so big \nit could cover the sky...'

00271494:'You all gotta be \nready for the worst!'
00271495:'You want to see the \nDon? He just took off, \nleading some forces.'
00271496:'Where are they going? \nWho knows? No clue.'
00271497:'Where are they keeping \nthat Knight they caught? \nI want to go laugh at him.'
00271498:'That Knight dragged people into \njail, and now he's in jail himself...\nBet he's not laughing now.'
00271499:'They went and let \nthat Knight out of jail.'
00271500:'What are they doing, \nslacking at the jail \nat a time like this?'
00271501:'It'd be nice if something \nhappened around here.'
00271502:'I can't stand days \nwith no excitement.'
00271503:'There's no point in \nsigning a treaty! We should \ngo crush the Empire.'
00271504:'To hell with the \nEmpire. We should go \nwipe them off the map.'
00271505:'What the...?! \nWhat is that thing?!'

00271511:'The Empire's in \nbad shape, too.'
00271512:'Serves them right.'
00271513:'W-we're safe as long as we stay\ninside the barrier, right?'
00271514:'Hey, I can laugh \nbecause it's not me.'
00271515:'What the hell is happening?'
00271516:'This is a dream...\nThis is all a dream, \nI'm telling you...'
00271517:'Monsters are evil, so we \nkill 'em! That's the mission \nof the Hunting Blades.'
00271518:'Monsters are evil, so we \nkill 'em! That's the mission \nof the Hunting Blades.'
00271519:'Hunting the monsters is our job. \nIt ain't funny if other guilds\ntry to muscle in on our territory!'
00271520:'We Hunting Blades\nwill lose face if the \nmonsters defeat us!'
00271521:'Union headquarters are up ahead.\nDid you want to see the Don?<PAGE>I'm sure he's asleep \nat this hour.'
00271522:'Of course, even the \nDon sleeps at night.<PAGE>You know the elderly \nget to bed early.'
00271523:'I don't kill \npeople willingly.<PAGE>It's not about morals \nor taking lives. \nIt's just my policy.'
00271524:'Whatever. I gotta pay \nthe Empire back. I'm \ngonna have some fun.'
00271525:'A guild feud, huh?\nThat's not so bad \nevery now and then.'
00271526:'A guild struggle, huh? \nThat has nothing to do \nwith us Hunting Blades.'
00271527:'Looks like the \nsummons from the \nchief isn't happening yet.'

00271540:'They don't give a damn \nabout common people. \nStuck up, little...'
00271541:'We'll stick with the Don to the \nend! And we'll "don" our finest \narmor to do it! Hah hah hah!!'

00271560:'I wonder what the \nDon would do...'
00271561:'Everyone dies. \nBut the Don did \nit with style.'
00271562:'I never thought I'd see the \nDon's final moments \nwith my own eyes.'
00271563:'I hope the Hunting \nBlades are all right.'
00271564:'Tison and I started together. \nWe haven't worked together \nfor a while though...'
00271565:'Monsters are evil. \nBig monsters \nare big evils.<PAGE>We should get rid \nof the big evils \nbefore the little ones.'

00271567:'...For a monster, that \nthing's just a little \ntoo big to feel real.\nOh well. \nWe gotta take it down \nlike any other monster...!'
00271568:'But it's too big... \nI'm just not feeling this...'

00271570:'I mean, you know... \nHe's the Don!'
00271571:'W-we'll be fine.\nThe Don will do \nsomething about this.'

00271573:'See? I was right. \nThe Don took care \nof things.'
00271574:'Th-this town has always \nbeen that way. See? \nNothing to worry about.'
00271575:'The Empire, the Knights... \nNobody in this town \ntrusts them at all.'

00271580:'That Ragou guy \ngot away, though...'
00271581:'I respect the Don, but \nI'm not big on the idea \nof a friendship treaty.'
00271582:'I can't believe the \nDon would sign a treaty \nwith the Empire...<PAGE>Wait, this is the Don. \nCould it be to throw \nthe Empire off guard?'
00271583:'What the hell is that?!'
00271584:'I never seen anything \nlike that, much less \neaten anything like it!'
00271585:'The fun never \nends in this town.'

00271597:'We're back at peace! \nThat's what my mommy said.'

00271612:'Mommy! Mommy! \nWhere are you?!'
00271613:'Things certainly are \nlively in town recently.'
00271614:'It's a good thing. \nYoung folk should \nbe lively.'
00271615:'I never thought the \nDon would pass on \nbefore this old man...'
00271616:'To live such a \nfruitful life and \nhave it end that way...'
00271617:'How could things possibly \nget any worse...?'
00271618:'It seems like there's nothing \ngood to talk about lately.'
00271619:'What is going to happen \nto our world?'

00271628:'Zaphias Brew, Ehmead Snow,\nDese... They're good drinks\nthat will really quench your thirst.'
00271629:'We'll hold a banquet \nhere when the friendship \ntreaty is signed.'
00271630:'I'll bring out the really good \nstuff when that happens!'
00271631:'Are things all right outside? \nI'll go out there if anyone \nneeds help.'
00271632:'Even if it means I have to use \nan empty bottle as a weapon, \nI'll do it to protect this town.'
00271633:'The customers just won't \nstop complaining lately.'
00271634:'They complain so much I want \nto start complaining myself.'
00271635:'Careful not to drown your \ncares in too much drink. You'll \njust make yourself sick.'
00271636:'The Don was quite \na drinker, you know.\nHe came by often.'
00271637:'Fancy a drink before you go?'
00271638:'What would you like? \nCider? Soda? Milkshake?<PAGE>Or maybe rain water is good \nenough for you? We also have hot \nmiso soup, if that's your fancy.'

00271644:'Seriously, what is all \nthe commotion about?'
00271645:'Barbos... That's the chief \nof the Blood Alliance, right?'
00271646:'I hear that guy\nhas some skill.'
00271647:'People dying... \nThat's exactly how \ntimes change.'

00271652:'Yeah, I'm troubled, \nbut I ain't about to say \nanything stupid like you.'
00271653:'I'm just a mercenary. \nWhy'd I even help \nrepair that bridge?'
00271654:'Well, I guess it would \nbe pretty inconvenient \nwithout a bridge.'
00271655:'The Don was the Don, right to the end.'
00271656:'I've never met any other man\nlike the Don in my whole life.'
00271657:'There's trouble in the Empire? \n Well, that news makes my day.'
00271658:'There's trouble in the Empire? \nWell, that's nothing new.'
00271659:'Things are so bad lately \nI can't even get by \nwithout a drink.'
00271660:'Ooooh... *Burp!*'
00271661:'Nothing is solved by \ndrinking. I know that.<PAGE>But I can't get by \nwithout this stuff.'
00271662:'*Hic!* I can't believe I'm \ndrunk after 10 iced teas...'

00271682:'Huh? No, I'm not drunk.'
00271683:'This is a fine drink. \nFortune's Market sure knows \nhow to pick the right stuff.'
00271684:'When business is good,\ndrinking is that much more fun.'
00271685:'I make my own way no matter how \ncrazy things get. That's how you do \nthings when you're part of a guild.'
00271686:'It's a disgrace for a guildsman\nto get caught up in every new \ntrend that comes along.'
00271687:'I come here every day...\nI wonder if I'm living a decent life...'

00271700:'But I just can't pry \nmy hands off this bottle...'
00271701:'I heard there's a sword style \ncalled Drunken Sword. It lets \nyou fight even while drinking.<PAGE>I want to learn it.'
00271702:'If I could master Drunken Sword, \nI could work while I drink...'
00271703:'This is where we mercenaries \nscout for work.'
00271704:'Don't bother me.'
00271705:'Thanks to Barbos, attitudes \ntowards us mercenaries\nhave gotten pretty cold.'
00271706:'I'm may be a mercenary, \nbut I'm not part of the \nBlood Alliance...'
00271707:'I'm scrambling every day\nto regain the trust of\nthe tarnished mercenaries.<PAGE>Damn it, it's all \nBarbos's fault.'

00271712:'Get another guild if \nyou want that thing dead.'
00271713:'More resistance among \nthe guilds? It better not be \nanother mercenary guild.'
00271714:'Any more bad reflections \non the mercenaries, and \nwe'll seriously be out of work.'
00271715:'The more chaos befalls the \nworld, the more the mercenary \nbusiness flourishes.<PAGE>Even so, it is forbidden for us \nto create conflicts ourselves.'

00271717:'I bet I could find plenty of jobs\nin Zaphias right now.'
00271718:'Of course, that's only \nif I could make it there.'
00271719:'My sword is no match for that \nnasty monster in the sky.<PAGE>I don't think there's \nany other sword who can \ntake it down either...'

00271748:'Wonder who stuck it \nto Barbos, anyway.'
00271749:'I don't think it's \ngoing to be too easy \ngetting the treaty signed.'

00272128:'We'll have to put the \nbarrier blastia under much heavier \nguard from now on.'
00272129:'Even our mighty barrier won't \nprotect us against the Knights.'
00272130:'If only we had a barrier\nthat worked against people.'

00272139:'The barrier failure, the monsters \nattacking... So much for the \nfairytale about barrier safety.<PAGE>Sure, we're safer with it,  \nbut it's no guarantee.'
00272140:'Even the peace we have right now\nis only a temporary thing.'
00272141:'Barriers protect us from monsters, \nbut they can't protect us from \nthe evil of other humans.<PAGE>The Don\nprotected us\nfrom that.'
00272142:'What you can protect, and \nhow you protect it... It \nchanges with the situation.'
00272143:'The barrier in Zaphias\nis acting up.<PAGE>If you put all your trust in the barrier,\nit could hurt you in the end.'

00272155:'No matter how much the \nEmpire may struggle, they're \nno match for the Don.'
00272156:'He's the strongest man I \nknow. Next to me, of course.'
00272157:'Barbos doesn't know \nhis place.'
00272158:'What he needs is a lesson. \nAnd I'll smack some \nlearning into his head!'
00272159:'People from the Empire\nhave begun to show \ntheir faces around here.'
00272160:'I despise the Empire.'

00272165:'The Knights helped \nus repair our bridge.'
00272166:'I guess there are some \ndecent Knights, after all.'
00272167:'All of Dahngrest\nis in mourning.'
00272168:'But it won't last long. \nThat's not what the Don\nwould have wanted.'
00272169:'The young are still \nin despair over the \nDon's death.<PAGE>It just goes to show\nwhat a huge influence\nthat old man had.'
00272170:'The young people \nmust truly stand firm now \nthat the Don has passed on.'
00272171:'If only I were twenty \nyears younger... I'd take \nthat monster out quick.'
00272172:'Ohh, my back...'
00272173:'I will not be \noutdone by kids!'
00272174:'Ohh, my back...'
00272175:'I'm just here for a visit, \nand the barrier disappears! \nTalk about bad luck...'
00272176:'I'm just really unlucky. \nYeah, really unlucky.'
00272177:'I'm just here for a visit, \nand the barrier disappears! \nTalk about bad luck...'
00272178:'I'm just really unlucky. \nYeah, really unlucky.'
00272179:'The barrier was fixed... \nNow I can breathe a \nsigh of relief.'
00272180:'I can have a good \ndrink here. Maybe my \nluck has turned a little.'
00272181:'Sometimes the solidarity \nof the guilds\ncan \nbe a painful thing.'
00272182:'People with conviction \nwho get bound up by rules \ncan often do crazy things.'
00272183:'Barbos is only doing \nwhat he thinks is right.'
00272184:'Don't like it? \nYour only choice is to resist \nwith a show of force.'
00272185:'It's so nice to enjoy a \ngood meal while listening \nto this beautiful music.'
00272186:'Hey, why don't you take \nit easy and enjoy a nice \nmeal once in a while?'
00272187:'It's so nice to enjoy a \ngood meal while listening \nto this beautiful music.'
00272188:'Hey, why don't you take \nit easy and enjoy a nice \nmeal once in a while?'
00272189:'That monster in \nflames seems like it's \nlooking for something.'
00272190:'Do you think it has some \nkind of intelligence?\nNo, that's impossible.'
00272191:'There's going to be a lot \nof casualties if it comes to \nfacing Palestralle head-on.'
00272192:'Belius, from Palestralle, \nis just as important to \nthe guilds as the Don is.'
00272193:'Belius and the Don... \nEveryone knew and respected them,\nand now, one after the other...'
00272194:'They say Leviathan's Claw\nis pulling the strings.'
00272195:'The kindling that started \nin the Empire looks like it \nwill spread to the world.<PAGE>It's times like these that try \nthe unity of the guilds.'
00272196:'We all have to work \ntogether to prepare for \nunforseen situations.'
00272197:'The Imperial Knights and \nthe Council are weak, \nand there's no Emperor.<PAGE>Now's the time for the guilds\nto take over the Empire.'
00272198:'This is the perfect time \nto overthrow the Empire. \nBut no one's standing up.<PAGE>If only the Don\nwere here...'
00272199:'If the Union would band \ntogether, there'd be \nnothing to be afraid of.<PAGE>Let's kill monster in \nthe sky already.'
00272200:'Our true enemy \nis the Empire, \nnot that rabble!'
00272201:'To fight or not to fight. \nThat is the question.<PAGE>...But thinking about it \ndoesn't bring any answers...'
00272202:'What would be best is if \nthe monsters went away while \nI'm thinking about it.'
00272203:'To fight or not to fight. \nThat is the question.<PAGE>...But thinking about it \ndoesn't bring any answers...'
00272204:'What would be best is if \nthe monsters went away while \nI'm thinking about it.'
00272205:'The monsters went away \nwhile I was still wondering \nwhether to fight or not.<PAGE>I guess that's what I was \nasking for, but...I'm \na little disappointed.'
00272206:'I'm a little disappointed I didn't \nget to show what I can do.'
00272207:'To join the fight with \nthe Imperial Knights or not. \nThat is the question.<PAGE>...I really don't \nwant to go.'
00272208:'What would be best is \nif it all ended while \nI'm thinking about it.'
00272209:'Barbos should be left \nto the Imperial Knights.<PAGE>There's no reason to \nfight pointless battles.'
00272210:'I'll just drink and \nsleep well tonight.'
00272211:'I hear the Knights \ndefeated Barbos.<PAGE>I'm a little disappointed \nI didn't get a chance to \nshow my true strength.'
00272212:'I always end up regretting \nall the wrong choices \nI keep making.'
00272213:'To support the friendship \ntreaty or not...<PAGE>I see the pros in \nsupporting it, but I see \nthe cons too. Hmm...'
00272214:'It's just easier to go with \nwhichever side wins out...'
00272215:'There's a huge monster \nnear the bridge?<PAGE>No way. \nThere's nothing \nthat I can do.'
00272216:'Is that huge monster \nstill out there?'
00272217:'So the Imperial Knights used \ntheir hoplon blastia to chase \nthat huge monster away.<PAGE>I'm disappointed that I \ncouldn't use my strength \nto chase it away myself.'
00272218:'Yet again, I failed \nto seize the opportunity \nto show my true strength.'
00272219:'The Don died while I was \njust sitting around worrying.'
00272220:'I'm such a failure...'
00272221:'...I've been reborn. \nI will protect this town.<PAGE>No matter what happens, \nI will not waver. \nI will not run away.'
00272222:'I know I said I \nwouldn't run away...<PAGE>...But I'm still a \nlittle scared...'
00272223:'What's with that huge \nmonster? Th-that's \nagainst the rules, right?<PAGE>You're telling me \nto fight that thing?'
00272224:'I-I have no choice. I'll see \nhow things go from here for a \nlittle while, then I'll join in.'
00272225:'Th-that monster still \nscares me a little, but \nI'm going to do it!'

00272583:'It's so nice and cool at night! \nAnd I'm gonna make sure it \nstays peaceful at night too!'
00272584:'Please let us know if you have \nany trouble. Captain <STR>(FRE)\nhas told us to listen well.'
00272585:'Travelers have been \ntelling me things are \nbad back in the Empire.<PAGE>I'm worried, but our orders are \nto keep the peace here in \nMantaic. We must hold fast!'
00272586:'With the Empire unstable, we \nmust be resolute! We must not \nlet the citizens fall to despair!'
00272587:'I-is that a monster? H-how \nare we supposed to defend the town \nfrom something like that...?<PAGE>W-wait, what \nam I saying?!<PAGE>I can't panic... That would \nonly worry the people. \nWe must hold fast!'
00272588:'I'm fine, I'm really fine... \nI'm not scared... I'm \nnot scared at all...'
00272589:'I-is that thing in the sky \ngonna attack or what? I wish \nit would make up its mind!'
00272590:'But... I don't want it to \nmake up its mind to come! \nDon't attack! Stay away! '
00272591:'I saw something that looked \nlike a massive bird in the \nsky before we came here.<PAGE>I asked around, but I was the \nonly person in the brigade who \nsaw it. Nobody believed me.'
00272592:'Sure there aren't any \nflying monsters that size, \nbut I know what I saw!<PAGE>Hmm... \nWhat do you \nthink it was? '
00272593:'*Grumble* \nA traveler told me he saw that \ngiant bird, and a dragon, too!<PAGE>Why didn't anyone in our \nbrigade see them? I still can't \nget anyone to believe me...'
00272594:'Now I'm going to have a \nreputation as a bigmouth. I have \nto do something about that...'
00272595:'With that weird thing in the \nsky, everyone's forgotten \nabout the giant bird I saw.<PAGE>I guess I managed to escape \ngetting branded a bigmouth, \nbut I feel strange.'
00272596:'Still, I'm even more \nconcerned about that \nstrange thing in the sky.'
00272597:'You know that new town \neveryone's talking about? \nI hear it floats in the sky.<PAGE>...That's gotta be a lie. \nWhoever made that story up... \nThat's a real bigmouth.'
00272598:'But if it were true... Floating \ncities? And that huge monster? \nIt's the end of the world.'
00272599:'It seems that \nCaptain Cumore\nwasn't a real magistrate.<PAGE>He didn't want us to find \nout, so he prohibited the \nresidents from going out.'
00272600:'But I'm glad he wasn't a real \nmagistrate. If he was, we wouldn't \nbe able to run him out of town. '
00272601:'The Knights in town \nare quite different from the \nones that were here before!<PAGE>I guess this is the way \ngenuine knights behave. \nThey're so dependable. '
00272602:'Their captain, too... I only saw him \nfor a second, but he was so handsome! \nHe seems like a wonderful guy.∀'
00272603:'Whew... I can finally get out of \nthe house and walk around. I thought \nI'd never see the sun again...<PAGE>This is all thanks \nto that young \nKnight, <STR>(FRE).'
00272604:'The Knight who was here \nbefore... Cu-something? \nHe was terrible.<PAGE>Where did he run off to? \nI'd wager he got caught \nand thrown in jail. '
00272605:'The town is finally free again, \nbut now there's all this hubbub \nabout giant birds and the Empire.<PAGE>Everyone's in such a fuss. People \nshould take things easy, like me. \nOtherwise, life'll tire you out.'
00272606:'Honestly, I'm more afraid \nof my wife's scoldings. '
00272607:'*Fgggh...grph...grrph... \nfthrrrp...gggh*'
00272608:'Oh my, I forgot to \nput in my dentures! \nHah hah hah.'
00272609:'All the brouhaha lately \nhas some folk saying \nit's the end of the world.<PAGE>Foolishness. Do they really \nthink the world's going \nto end that easily?'
00272610:'It seems like the younger \npeople are, the gloomier they \nare... Kids, I swear...'
00272611:'Say, do you know about the hole \nback behind the inn? There's \nsomething...strange in it...<PAGE>What could it be? \nIt's kind of scary...'
00272612:'You people should probably \nstay away from it. '
00272613:'I heard the castle\nin Zaphias was \ndestroyed recently...<PAGE>What's with all \nthe strange things \nhappening lately? '
00272614:'The knights in the <STR>(FRE)\nBrigade will protect this \ntown. Everything's fine.<PAGE>We have our barrier, too. '
00272615:'You know that city floating in \nthe sky? I wonder if it was on the \nground, and then just took off!<PAGE>This town isn't going to go, \n"Fwoop!" and sail off into the \nsky too some day, is it?'
00272616:'What are we going \nto do if this town \nstarts floating...?<PAGE>We won't be able to import \nfood from other towns anymore. \nI hope we don't starve.'
00272617:'Hey, we're not supposed \nto walk around at night. \nKeep this a secret.<PAGE>The best time for going out's \nactually at night. It's so dark \nyou can hide almost anywhere. '
00272618:'If I had some black clothes \nnobody could see me...<PAGE>Hey, wait. \nYour clothes are \nall black.'
00272619:'What?! Cumore\nran away?<PAGE>I was hoping I'd get \nto pound him good. '
00272620:'He must've been \nscared of me. \nHah hah hah!'
00272621:'Owww... My old lady \nreally went to work \non me again.<PAGE>All I did was stay out 'til \ndawn three days in a row... \nIs that so bad...?'
00272622:'You agree with me, \ndon't you? '
00272623:'*Hic!*<PAGE>Uh? Whuzzah? Look, thurrrs a big \nol' monster in the skyyyy... \nHah hah hah! '
00272624:'Uh ohhh... \nmy ol' lady's gonna \nblow up again...<PAGE>She's gonna be sayin', "You big \noaf! What're you doin' drinkin' \nin tha m-middle of the day"...!'
00272625:'My wife thought I was \ndrinking too much, so she \nslashed my allowance...<PAGE>Now I can only afford \none drink per day... \nI-it's the end of the world!'
00272626:'What? You want to know why \nI'm not that concerned about \nmonsters and cities in the sky?<PAGE>That stuff ain't nothing \ncompared to getting your \nallowance cut... *Sniffle*... '
00272627:'I just stopped in here at \nMantaic on my vacation, but it \nreally is a lovely town, isn't it?'
00272628:'I heard some horror stories \nabout the Knights here, but they \ndon't seem to be a problem now. '
00272629:'Apparently a large number of \ntroops came here a while ago, \nand then left quickly.<PAGE>Whatever could have happened?'
00272630:'Not that the comings and goings \nof soldiers has any bearing \non my vacation, of course.'
00272631:'Wh-what is that nasty \nthing in the sky? '
00272632:'I once had a meal prepared by a \nyoung lady from the family of my \nacquaintances, the Kimlascas.<PAGE>Compared to that meal, \nthe thing in the sky \nisn't very vile at all.'
00272633:'The new town that was \nfounded floats upon the \nair, does it not?<PAGE>I've made up my mind! \nThat's where I'll \nbe traveling next. '
00272634:'What manner of town \ncould it be? I hope they \nhave high-class salons...'
00272635:'Whoa... \nYou can see me? I was \neven holding my breath.<PAGE>You've got pretty good eyes.'
00272636:'I wonder what the Knights \nwould do if they found me. \nTalk about exciting... '
00272637:'I'm just thankful to be free, \nI guess. You only miss \nsomething once you lose it...<PAGE>We've all got the \nknights of the <STR>(FRE)\nBrigade to thank for that.'
00272638:'Now we'll be able to \nlive without worrying. '
00272639:'That giant bird... \nI bet its droppings \nare simply nasty.<PAGE>Oh dear. Excuse me \nfor saying something \nso indelicate.'
00272640:'Oh no! Now that I have \nthat thought in my head! \nI can't shake it... '
00272641:'Dearie me. It's just one \nstrange happening right \nafter another, isn't it?<PAGE>What's going to come along \nafter that big, sickening \nthing in the sky?'
00272642:'Oh, I know what's next. \nThe sun's going to split \ninto three, or something. '
00272643:'Goodness gracious. \nThe right answer was a \ncity being built in the sky.<PAGE>I was so sure it'd be \nthree suns after that \ngiant flying monster...'
00272644:'I guess it doesn't really matter. \nIt's not a quiz, after all. '
00272645:'Mom and Dad came \nback, so I'm not scared \nat night anymore!'
00272646:'But it's still not fair how \nthey're always telling me \nit's past my bedtime...'
00272647:'The Knights are watching \nover us too, so I'm \nnot scared at all!'
00272648:'Even if a spooky \nbogeyman came for me, \nthe Knights'd get him.'
00272649:'That monster... \nThere in the sky... \nI-it's scary. '
00272650:'But it's also...kinda... \npretty in a way... '
00272651:'W-we're still getting ready... \nSo please come back again later. '
00272652:'W-we're not open yet... \nHuh?! Suspicious? I'm not \nbeing suspicious at all!'
00272653:'W-Welcome. \nParty of six...and, uh, one dog? \nThat'll be 400 Gald. '
00272654:'<inn>Would you like to rest?　'
00272655:'Come back any time \nyou need a rest. '
00272656:'You made it through the desert?! \nRest easy now. You've earned it. \nBut that'll still be 400 Gald. '
00272657:'<inn>Would you like to rest?　'
00272658:'Come back any time \nyou need a rest. '
00272659:'Take your time and enjoy \nwhat night should really \nbe like here in Mantaic.'
00272660:'Usually there's a 12 \no'clock curfew, but today \nwe can stay out all night!'
00272661:'Usually there's a 12 \no'clock curfew, but today \nwe can stay out all night!'
00272662:'Welcome, welcome! \nYou must be tired. \nA room is 400 Gald.'
00272663:'<inn>Would you like to rest?　'
00272664:'Please come again.'
00272665:'Welcome! I've heard a lot of \nunsettling rumors lately. \nA room is 400 Gald.'
00272666:'<inn>Would you like to rest?　'
00272667:'Come back any time \nyou need a rest. '
00272668:'Welcome! \nWe've got a delicious dinner and \nnice, fluffy beds for 400 Gald. '
00272669:'<inn>Would you like to rest?　'
00272670:'Come back any time \nyou need a rest. '
00272671:'......'
00272672:'...You're really annoying.'
00272673:'Hey! It's you! Did my \ncanteen help in coming back \nfrom the desert alive?<PAGE>Go ahead. Keep it. Use it as \nlong as you like. It's my way of \ncelebrating our new freedom! '
00272674:'The <STR>(FRE) Brigade's great \nand all, but you people are pretty \nincredible, too. I can tell!'
00272675:'A whole bunch of \nKnights showed up \nagain a while ago.<PAGE>I was so worried they \nwere here to take over \nthe town again. '
00272676:'Luckily, that didn't \nhappen at all.<PAGE>What was that all about, anyway?'
00272677:'Have you seen it? That thing \nin the sky. How can something \nthat big stay afloat?<PAGE>Hmm? There are more important \nthings than how it floats? Oh \nwhatever. Details, details...'
00272678:'Do you think it has wings? \nOr maybe a blastia?'
00272679:'You know about the city in the sky, \nright? I bet it's got something \nto do with that monster up there.<PAGE>Don't you get it? Advertising! \nThat thing's a big ad for the flying \ncity. Business must be booming.'
00272680:'That gives me an idea... Maybe \nI should try advertising, too. It \nmight make my life a lot easier...'
00272681:'Sorry, but we're closed at night. Actually, \nwe're taking a break now, so coming \nduring the day's no good, either.'
00272682:'I'm sorry, but we aren't taking \ntickets at this time.'
00272683:'What am I doing here at this \ntime of night, you ask?<PAGE>I don't know, I feel \nlike I can't really relax \nunless I'm here.'
00272684:'Wait, does that \nmake me a \nworkaholic?'
00272685:'No boats are allowed to launch \nafter dark. Our apologies.'
00272686:'Of course, that doesn't mean \nwe can always take the boats \nout during the day, either.'
00272687:'Always busy, day or night, it's \nthe Trino Ferry at your service.♪<PAGE>I've been doing so much paperwork for \nall the evacuees from the capital, \nI haven't been getting any sleep.'
00272688:'My goodness, I might just \npass out from overwork.'
00272689:'No boats running at night. \nNo boats running during the \nday, either. Our apologies!'
00272690:'That busy period we went through, \nseems like a bad dream now...'
00272691:'They told me they can't pay \nme to be here at night, and \nthat I should just go home.<PAGE>I'm um, here anyway, though.'
00272692:'It's my mission in life right now \njust to sit here in this very spot.'
00272693:'What is that tower? <PAGE>I hope it doesn't interfere \nwith the operation \nof the ship...'
00272694:'That has nothing to do with the sea\nbecause that happened on the mountain!\nBut that's something I can't say.'
00272695:'Here at Trino Transport we're \nbusy both day and night!<PAGE>We're accepting cargo for \nshipping at all hours!'
00272696:'The future's in transportation, you know! That's why \nwe've gotta fight the good fight around the clock!'

00272728:'Zzz... \nHuh...?<PAGE>About the only thing I'm gonna listen to at this \nlate hour, is some tasty tidbits about my stone.'
00272729:'Zzz... \nHuh...?<PAGE>If you're wakin' me up this late at night, does that \nmean you've got some news about my precious stone?'
00272730:'The magistrate's takes his own \ncut of the taxes, so I'm not \nselling anything right now.<PAGE>Sorry to get your hopes up.'
00272731:'I lucked out on this sweet spot, though, \nso I've gotta hold onto it...'
00272732:'Now that Ragou's gone, a new \nmagistrate's on their way.<PAGE>Here's hoping that means the \ntaxes'll be lowered a bit...'
00272733:'Just you wait a few months, \nand my shop'll have the hottest \ngoods in town...I hope.'
00272734:'The new magistrate's arrived, but \nthe taxes haven't come down yet...<PAGE>I guess it's no easy thing for a low-level \nbureaucrat to cut taxes once they've \nbeen inflated, though.'
00272735:'Man, just when am I gonna be able to get \nthis business back on its feet again...?'
00272736:'There's some real panic breaking out around \nthe capital... And now the Tolbyccian continent's \ngone nuts over the death of the Don.<PAGE>There's no telling when I'll be able \nto get business going again...'
00272737:'Just how am I supposed to \nscrape out a living, come \ntomorrow, I ask ya...?'
00272738:'My savings is draining away one day at \na time, just paying for this spot...<PAGE>So what am I still doing here? This is \nthe best spot in the lot, and I'll be \ndamned if I'm just gonna let it go.'
00272739:'I know that's sorta like putting \nthe cart before the horse, but \nI can't let myself quit.'
00272740:'If you ask me, there's been more misfortune \nlately than when Ragou was running things.<PAGE>Maybe I'm in the wrong for being \nso attached to this place.'
00272741:'Wonder if my luck'll change \nif I move to another town \nand open a shop there.'
00272742:'I've made up my mind! If this store's \ngoing down, I'm going down with it!<PAGE>Let 'em call me crazy if they want to. \nI'm gonna do my business right here.'

00272745:'The place across the street \nseems to be doing all right... \nOoh! That just burns me! '
00272746:'The harbor's been opened again, but no boats \nhave arrived yet. When will they get here?<PAGE>Come on, get here already!'
00272747:'It's like I can feel our business \nlosing customers by the minute... \nI mean, give us a break already!'
00272748:'The trade routes still aren't \nback to normal, yet.<PAGE>Oooh! I swear, Fortune's Market is \ntrying to establish a monopoly!'
00272749:'I wonder if Fortune's Market wouldn't \nlet us join up with them...'
00272750:'Fortune's Market has \ntheir own exclusive \nsupply routes!<PAGE>Like through the glacial plains in the \nnorth part of the continent, for example. \nHow can we compete with that?'
00272751:'Transporting cargo across \nthin sheets of ice is one \nrisky proposition, right?'
00272752:'The port is clogged with battleships, and some \nweird building's popped up out in the ocean.<PAGE>So how is Fortune's Market \ngetting all their \nmerchandise, huh?'
00272753:'Business is booming for the place across \nthe way, even at times like this...<PAGE>Hmm, joining Fortune's Market doesn't \nseem so bad now, after all...'
00272754:'With the world as unstable as \nit is, I decided to cut my losses \nand join  Fortune's Market.<PAGE>And now I get hit with all sorts of \nentry fees and member's dues! Do \nthey think money grows on trees?!'
00272755:'Wherever you go, it's the \nlocals in a given area that \nhave to stick together...'
00272756:'We've had earthquakes, and the mountain to the north collapsed. \nHonestly, there's times I've almost packed up and left.<PAGE>But leaving the place I was raised \nin...much less venturing outside \nthe barrier, is just...you know?'
00272757:'The people in the shop next \ndoor haven't given up, so I've \ngot to stay strong myself.'
00272758:'Zzz... \n...Huh?<PAGE>I've gone and fallen asleep right \nwhen the world's in a pinch...'
00272759:'Zzz... \n...Huh?<PAGE>Dag nabbit, I fell \nasleep again.'
00272760:'Well, now. Travelers, are you? This is something you \ndon't see everyday. No one but me here at Nor inn, \nI'm afraid. Do come and stay a bit, if you like.'
00272761:'It's gotten quite late, hasn't \nit? Why not turn in for \nthe night at our inn?'
00272762:'It's late, travelers. \nDo what's best and stay \nthe night at the inn.'
00272763:'If you wander about too late, you're \nlikely to run into the mer-people \nwho come ashore at night.'
00272764:'Early checkout will save you 3 Gald, but \nlate checkin costs 3 Gald extra. Why not \ncall it a day and stay at the inn?'
00272765:'It's gotten quite late, you \nknow. You must be sleepy.'
00272766:'Haste makes waste, as they say. Why not \ntake a breather and slow things down. \nHere now, right this way to the inn.'
00272767:'It's gotten quite late, you \nknow. You must be sleepy.'
00272768:'It's bad luck to wander about \ntoo much after dark. You'd be \nwise to stay a night with us.'
00272769:'It's gotten quite late, you \nknow. You must be sleepy.'
00272770:'You may be in town, but the dark can \nbe quite dangerous. Best to stay \na night with us, if you ask me.'
00272771:'It's gotten quite late, you \nknow. You must be sleepy.'
00272772:'Where could you be off \nto at this late hour? \nWhy not stay with us?'
00272773:'It's gotten quite late, you \nknow. You must be sleepy.'
00272774:'Ragou, you no good cheat. \nHick... Let us take the \nboats out, dammit...<PAGE>It's gettin' ta be, I can't get \nby without drinkin' these days...'
00272775:'I want ta be on a ship again! \nTa be out on the sea...'

00272777:'O, a man needs the \nsea! Needs ta travel \nthe ocean's roads!'
00272778:'What's the deal with this town, anyway? \nHick... A fella's liable ta go stir \ncrazy, in a place like this...<PAGE>But I can send my sorrows packin', so \nlong as I've got my drink ta help me.'
00272779:'O, the sea... O, the \nsun... Ahh, there's \nnothin' finer...'

00272781:'Sing...! O, \ninverted \nworld...!'
00272782:'I saw a ring, I did! \nHick... What the hell's \nthat mean, huh...?!<PAGE>Urgh...<PAGE>I'm in the mood for a drink!'
00272783:'A ring...! It's \nround. Perfectly...round...?'
00272784:'Somethin' not right with \nthat sky. Hick... Aw, \nwho gives a damn...?<PAGE>It all disappears when \nI drink, right...?!'
00272785:'This ugly sky! My hands and my feet! \nI want to forget it all...!'
00272786:'That earthquake freaked \nme out, man... Hick... \nI don't feel so good...<PAGE>The sky's spinnin. \nI can't feel \nmy legs...!'
00272787:'I'm a man...! Go ahead an' \ncrumble, ya mountain...! \nDamn, that's scary...!'
00272788:'"Rhybgaro! A beast that shines like the \ngolden light of the sun! Will he appear \nin the vicinity of Torim Harbor?"<PAGE>That's what the paper said. It likes \nthe water, so apparently it only \nshows itself on rainy days.'
00272789:'Ahh, what a lovely color, gold... The \nworld is coming up roses, my dears.'
00272790:'Heard the headlines? "New magistrate to be appointed \nin Torim Harbor! And only 18 years old!"<PAGE>As of tomorrow, \nthis town is going \nto be reborn.'
00272791:'Ahh, I love the smell of renewal in the morning... \nThe world's coming up roses, my dears.'
00272792:'Did you hear? "The Duce of the coliseum's \nhidden past revealed! Mastermind of \nthe Great War falls at last!" Finally, \nI can sleep soundly at night.'
00272793:'Ahh, my but peace is lovely... The \nworld is coming up roses, my dears.'
00272794:'Have you heard? "The citizens of the capital \ntake leave for a new promised land! Will \nthey find the hope of a new life?"<PAGE>The capital may have been ruined, \nbut maybe this'll give those \nfolks a new start.'
00272795:'Ahh, the frontier spirit is a beautiful thing... \nThe world's coming up roses, my dears.'
00272796:'This one says "Capital Liberated! \nDisorder Continues"! <PAGE>I'm just glad they've \navoided the fate our \ntown had to suffer. '
00272797:'Ahh, isn't liberation simply marvelous...? \nThe world's coming up roses, my dears.'
00272798:'"Mysterious ruins surface on the seas! Knights \narrive on scene, relieve world's fears!" \nor so I hear. Well thank goodness.<PAGE>No telling what might \nhappen if that thing \nwere left unattended.'
00272799:'Ahh, my but those Knights are certainly dashing... \nThe world's coming up roses, my dears.'
00272800:'Yo travelers, what's up? Welcome \nto the port town of Capua Nor.'
00272801:'Capua is split between Capua \nNor to the south and Capua \nTorim to the North.<PAGE>You're in Nor now, on the south side.'
00272802:'Originally, this was one city \nmade up of Nor, Torim, and \nDuo, built on the ocean.<PAGE>I suppose it's been more than \na hundred years since Duo \nsank to the bottom of the sea...'
00272803:'You can probably see \nit from the piers.<PAGE>See what? The bridge that once \nconnected Capua, Torim and Duo.'
00272804:'This town owes its prosperity to the \nregular liners and trading ships.<PAGE>Of course, Ragou's control was \nmore than enough to strip this \ntown of all its vitality.'
00272805:'Once a town loses its vitality, I'd wager it's \nan almost impossible task to get it back.'
00272806:'I've heard the barrier in the \ncapital's been torn down.<PAGE>Hope our blastia here's \ngonna be okay.'
00272807:'The blastia of this town is fashioned \nin the shape of an anchor.<PAGE>Look here, see how it's \nwritten on the ground?'
00272808:'I heard they managed to get the blastia \nin the capital back under control more \nor less, but you never can be too sure.<PAGE>We've got to...well, get this \ntown ready for...for whatever \ntomorrow might bring...'
00272809:'I hear we get researchers from Aspio \nthat come now and again to keep \nour blastia in good repair.<PAGE>'Course the patient's always \ngonna protest that they're \nin good health.'
00272810:'We've been having a series of earthquakes in these parts, \nrecently. Makes you wonder, you know. I've always thought \nthe bedrock around here was supposed to be solid.'
00272811:'I swear there's more than meets the eye with \nthese earthquakes. It just might have something \nto do with that monster up in the sky...'
00272812:'Aspio was located right smack at the \nbase of that tower. It had to've been \njust flattened, no two ways about it.<PAGE>Now who's gonna come to \ndo maintenance on the \nblastia, I ask ya...?'
00272813:'Gotta admit though, that thing is the definition \nof big. Wouldn't be surprised if the entire \nIlyccian continent just up and sank...'
00272814:'I can't stop thinking \nabout that sound. What \ncould it have been? <PAGE>They really should post news \nup on the boards faster.'
00272815:'I just can't wait \nfor them to post the \nlatest news here.<PAGE>I'm so excited!'
00272816:'It says, "Commandant Flynn of \nthe Imperial Knights Building City \non Hypionia. Open Call for Names."<PAGE>I just might go...'
00272817:'Ahh, there's nothing like breaking new ground, I tell you... The world's coming up roses my dears.'
00272818:'Lakiko... My dearest friend...<PAGE>Ragou took her away, and I \nhaven't seen her since...'
00272819:'I don't want to have to go. \nDoes that make me selfish...?'
00272820:'I've been so worried about that girl, \nI haven't been getting any sleep.<PAGE>My dear friend has come back \nfrom Ragou's mansion... Oh, I \nhope everything's all right.'
00272821:'Her mother says that she still \nwakes herself up each night with \nthe sounds of her own screams.'
00272822:'I haven't been able to sleep \nsince my friend told me \nabout Ragou's misdeeds.<PAGE>I'm so glad I didn't press her to tell me everything.'
00272823:'I have these bad dreams every night. \nThese bodiless people won't \nstop staring at me... Ooh...'
00272824:'When I go to bed at night I have \nnightmares so I can't sleep...<PAGE>And I have to stay awake during \nthe day, so I can't sleep then...'
00272825:'Wow... I am working on a serious \nsleep deficit here...'
00272826:'Ragou kept me from sleeping, but \nlately, I've finally started getting \nto sleep more regularly.<PAGE>For a while there, I wanted \nto sleep so badly I thought \nI might go crazy.'
00272827:'But now I can't keep from thinking \nawful thoughts during my waking hours. \nI guess I'm just no good...'
00272828:'You know the Rhybgaro that \nold official guy was talking \nabout? I know where it is.<PAGE>It's in the forest to the \nsouth. I'm not lying!'
00272829:'Rhybgaro horns are a vital \nsource of ki...ki...uh, a \nreally important medicine.<PAGE>...That's what the woman doctor \nin glasses with the white wolf \npuppy was saying, anyway.'
00272830:'Did you see the new magistrate? \nHe's a friendly looking young \nguy with blond hair.<PAGE>The last magistrate looked \nlike he'd be a friendly \nold man at first, too.'
00272831:'Power eventually corrupts the personalities \nof people who hold it.<PAGE>...That's what that knight \nwith the mask and the spiky \ngreen hair said, anyway.'
00272832:'The taxes aren't going down! I even \nsaw the guy at that stall over there \nstart crying. It's just rotten.<PAGE>What with the taxes \nso high, nobody \ncan buy anything.'
00272833:'Higher taxes should mean greater \nreturns to the people, and further \nbenefit to their lives.<PAGE>...Or at least that's what the \nroly-poly egghead with the blue \nhair and the scary voice said.'
00272834:'I heard the ocean to the north got all frozen \nsolid because of that "aer" stuff.<PAGE>Hey, if the sea water freezes, \ndo you think the ice \nwould taste salty?'
00272835:'The "aer" makes it possible for us \nto live our daily lives. We must \ngive thanks for its existence.<PAGE>...That's what that pink-haired \nKrityan lady with \na broom said.'
00272836:'It's awesome! A bunch of the \nempire's battleships are docked \nin the harbor right now.<PAGE>What's so cool about that? Well, \nthey're made all out of metal!'
00272837:'The warship called Sieg Krunos \ndoes 30 knots on the open sea, \nwith its "eh-ar terbines." <PAGE>...That's what the tan, \nshort-haired, tomboy-looking \nsailor girl was saying, anyway.'
00272838:'Everyone's talking about the end \nof the world lately, but...<PAGE>...Just look at how big the \nworld is! Do you think it's \nreally going to end so fast?'
00272839:'Besides, even if the world is ending, \nas long as we don't give up \nhope, we can go on fighting.<PAGE>...I heard that from \nthis hero with spiky \nblond hair.'
00272840:'Have you gone up the tower that came \nout of that mountain in the north?<PAGE>It looks like it's made \nup of a bunch of different \nbuildings.'
00272841:'The giant cities of the past were made \nup of buildings all stacked together that \nyou'd think they were really towers.<PAGE>...That's what this sword fighter \nwearing this big white bone \nthing on his head said.'
00272842:'If only Ragou hadn't come, \nmy future would be looking \na lot more rosy...<PAGE>Everything I touch lately seems \nto turn to dirt. What can someone \nlike me do to get along...?'
00272843:'I guess I'm just no good. And \nthe night only seems to make \nmy mood even worse...'
00272844:'That was a really loud rumble. \nBut it didn't phase me. <PAGE>Nothing gets done \nby worrying.'
00272845:'I should thank Ragou for \ngiving me the courage \nto face anything. <PAGE>Luckily, he isn't around \nto accept my gratitude.'
00272846:'There was a time when all I did was worry. But I realized, what's the point?<PAGE>I've got to keep my chin up. Life's too short, right?'
00272847:'When unimaginable events occur, all the little things in life seem to mean less to people.'
00272848:'I hear there's a guy who badmouths \nthe magistrate, but he'll only \ndo it under the cover of night.<PAGE>If he's gonna gripe, he \nshould do it out in the \nopen, you know, like me.'
00272849:'We can complain all we like, though. It's \nnot like anybody in charge is gonna listen.<PAGE>Not so long as they get to \nuse us for their amusement.'
00272850:'That damned Council, with its damned high \ntaxes... It's enough to make a fella wanna \ngive up on earning an honest living.'
00272851:'I mean, even when I get paid, my \nwallet's empty by the next day. \nMaybe I should just quit my job.'
00272852:'If the Don were to die, it'd upset the \nbalance between the empire and the guilds, \nand most likely turn to all out war.<PAGE>Hip hip hooray, \nwe'll all go down \ntogether.'
00272853:'...If that happens though, one guild or another's gonna \nmake a bid for power, which'll mean using that power \nto put down anybody who gets in their way. Gah...<PAGE>Fools, the lot \nof them!'
00272854:'We've got the guilds, the Council, \nand now it's the Knights.<PAGE>They're only interested in \nusing what power they've got \nto run things their way.'
00272855:'Just you watch. Sooner or later \nthis <STR>(FRE) character's gonna \nshow his true colors.'
00272856:'That boat carrying all those \nrefugees has gotta be \nin rough shape. It's cramped, \nit stinks. Man, gives \nme goose bumps just \nthinking about it.'
00272857:'Whatever, not like it's any skin \noff my back what happens to \nthat bunch from the capital.'
00272858:'First the Don dies, then that Commandant of the Knights \nchecks out. You'd think we're due for some peace \nand quiet, and then we get this thing with Aspio.<PAGE>What the hell are all those mages \ncooking up over there, anyway?'
00272859:'They're weak, but they \nhave some weird powers. <PAGE>But they don't have a clue \nhow to use their power. \nWe should be okay...'
00272860:'Isn't that tower around Aspio? <PAGE>I think the mages are \ndefinitely planning something.'
00272861:'I mean, a mage brought that \ntower back to begin with. <PAGE>He's going to monopolize \nthe blastia and get the \nEmpire on his side.'
00272862:'Besides, it's not like the empire or the \nguilds can really do anything about it.'
00272863:'You can never count on these guys \nwhen you really need them.'
00272864:'If you're looking for something to snack \non after dark, gels are the way to go.<PAGE>Low in fat, and easy \non the digestion, there's \nno beating gels.'
00272865:'Now if there was something like a night gel, \nyou know, that put you right to sleep, my midnight \nsnacking regimen would be complete.'
00272866:'At night I hide a few gels \nunder my pillow, and snack \non them in secret.<PAGE>Don't tell my husband, okay?'
00272867:'I'm so crazy about gels, I don't \nknow what to do with myself.'
00272868:'If there's a problem with distribution, \nsupply and demand will break down, and \nwe'll be looking at a gel shortage.'
00272869:'If I couldn't have gels in \nmy life, I think my heart \nmight just shrivel up...!'
00272870:'This town's become quite a tough place \nfor people to live. It used to be \nsuch a sleepy little place...'
00272871:'Now, Nor and Torim are different \nas night and day...<PAGE>Don't the guilds or the \nempire care at all how folks \nlike us are livin'?'
00272872:'We never had a magistrate \nhere when I was younger. <PAGE>When did the Empire \nget so strict...?'
00272873:'No matter how many new magistrates they \nsend us, they'll have a helluva time tryin' \nto beat the freedom of the old days.'
00272874:'I hear that Don \nWhitehorse has \npassed on.<PAGE>I used to take care of that \nguy, back when we were just \nrunts. Honest to goodness.'
00272875:'There was a time when the Don \nwas livin' with some relatives \nof mine in town here.<PAGE>He was five and I was eight. \nHeh, he used to look up \nto me in those days...'
00272876:'You know, life might just be easier in \na different town. I've caught myself \nthinkin' that any number of times...<PAGE>I'm past the age \nfor pickin' up and \nmovin', though.'
00272877:'All my old friends from this town \nhave passed on now. I've got nothin' \ntyin' me to this place anymore.<PAGE>Come to think of it...I've got nothin' \ntyin' me to this world anymore, either.'
00272878:'I've heard there was a place called \nDuo between Torim and Nor that sank \nsometime before I was born.<PAGE>To think that I'd see the day when \nit'd rise back up... I've really \nbeen around quite a while.'
00272879:'Huh? That thing floatin' on the \nthe waves isn't Duo, you say?<PAGE>Well then, what is it?'
00272880:'The sky's gone and cracked... The \nstrangest things have been happenin' \none right on top of the next.<PAGE>A life long lived never ceases to amaze.'
00272881:'Whoo boy, a life long lived never ceases to amaze.'
00272882:'What a shock! What right's a tower \nthat size got to come juttin' \nout of a mountain like that?!<PAGE>Life never ceases to amaze.'
00272883:'Wonder just what we've got \nin store for us next.<PAGE>Heh, I can hardly wait!♪'
00272884:'So it seems that towns with a strong imperial \npresence enjoy greater peace and stability.'
00272885:'We can walk free of worry in the \nstreets. What could be more splendid \nthan that? Wouldn't you agree?'
00272886:'The actions of this magistrate, \nRagou, are inexcusable. He has \nsullied the empire's good name.'
00272887:'Such a man is the exception to the \nrule, though. Surely the next magistrate \nwill set the record straight.'
00272888:'If the Don dies, I can't see \nhow the guild Union can escape \nsuffering as a result.<PAGE>At any rate, it should help shore up the welfare \nof the empire, and of this town as well.'
00272889:'Now is the time when the empire should \nuse its authority to reclaim direct \ncontrol over Capua Torim.<PAGE>It would seem that neither the Council nor \nthe Knights are eager to take action.'
00272890:'Alexei may have once been the proud leader \nof the Imperial Knights, but he was proven to \nbe nothing but a lowly coward in the end.<PAGE>He was never cut out to \nbe a leader among men.'
00272891:'If only we could have someone such \nas Sir Cumore, with an unimpeachably \nnoble pedigree, here.'
00272892:'This young knight, Sir <STR>(FRE), is \ntruly quite capable, is he not?<PAGE>I can speak no ill of him, though \nhe cannot claim a noble upbringing.'
00272893:'Still, he can be no match for \nthe likes of Sir Cumore.<PAGE>There is a knight who \nsurely has no equal.'
00272894:'How long must we wait until the \nnext emperor ascends the throne?<PAGE>If only the matter of ascension could \nbe settled, then surely this disorder \nwould be eased somewhat.'
00272895:'Be it His Highness Ioder, or some \nother candidate, the important \nthing is naming a successor...'
00272896:'The situation outside the town appears quite dire. \nThings remain quite peaceful within, however.<PAGE>The low-born commoners do raise \na panic from time to time...'
00272897:'We have a barrier here. \nWe shall be safe, \ncome what may.'
00272898:'I've got to get \nto the capital.<PAGE>I have to protect \nthe gel factory...'
00272899:'I wonder if going to the capital would \nmean leaving my husband behind...'
00272900:'There's no telling when the \nsupply of gels might run out, \nso I'm keeping a lookout.<PAGE>...It looks like things \nare still okay.'
00272901:'If it looks like they're selling out, maybe \nI should just buy up the whole stock. \nBut where will I get the money...?'
00272902:'If the world is falling apart, it's no \ntime to worry about gels, is it...?'
00272903:'If that thing in the sky were to \nbreak apart, it might just turn \ninto giant chunks of gel...'
00272904:'What is that tower? <PAGE>I'm scared, really scared...'
00272905:'This may not be the time to be calmly eating gel. '
00272906:'Gels? Oh, I'm all through \nwith that. Bottles are where \nit's at these days.'
00272907:'Holy bottles and dark bottles. \nWho needs gels as long \nas I've got those two.'
00272908:'Basically speaking, \nlaunching boats \nat night is \nforbidden.<PAGE>Even if that weren't the case, the port has been \nclosed down on account of the recent storms.'
00272909:'Whether the sun's rising or setting,\nit's rain, rain, and more rain.<PAGE>It really gets you down after a while.'
00272910:'I hear those mermen don't sleep at night. They'll \nattack a ship after dark as soon as during the day.<PAGE>They've gotta sleep \nsometime, right...?'
00272911:'Do you think maybe they \nwork in shifts...?'
00272912:'My word, this view is \nsimply breathtaking.<PAGE>Gazing out at this scenery, the \ntrials and tribulations of daily \nlife seem to melt away.'
00272913:'What can be waiting across\nthis ocean, I wonder.'
00272914:'A new magistrate, you \nsay? And what of it?<PAGE>I should think such matters \nare of no concern to me.'
00272915:'Whiling away my days gazing out at the \nsea is complete and utter bliss.'
00272916:'It's so hot out today. Twice, no \nit's three times as hot as usual.<PAGE>Ooh... How I'd love \nto swim in the sea...'
00272917:'Let's see, did I bring my bathing suit...? \nNot sure I feel like showing off my \narms though... You know how it is.'
00272918:'That cloud there, it looks just like the whipped \ncream on a strawberry short cake...<PAGE>N-no! What am I saying...?!'
00272919:'I'll surely lose some weight if only I can keep \nmy determination. I have the most marvelous getaway \nplanned for the beach here this summer...'
00272920:'Things got a bit boisterous when \nsome other people arrived, \nbut the calm has returned.<PAGE>This beach is mine alone, and I won't \nstand sharing it with others.'
00272921:'...If there's anything I simply \ncannot stand, it's noise...'
00272922:'I've claimed this \nspot as my own private \nluxury box...<PAGE>What cares do I have about the world and it's \ntroubles, so long as I have this view?'
00272923:'The sky? My eyes refuse \nto see anything that \nmight upset me.'
00272924:'How long will I be able to \nremain here gazing out at \nthis impeccable scene?<PAGE>Oh, would that \nthis moment could \nlast a thousand \neons.'
00272925:'Ahh, this rich tableau... Simply \nmarvelous... It's as though \nI were within a dream...'
00272926:'Looks like the empire's got \nplans to lock down Nordopolica \nusing its battleships.<PAGE>It's just awful, the way they throw their \nweight around like that, if you ask me.'
00272927:'There's no way the guilds stand \na chance if the empire really gets \nserious about wiping them out.'
00272928:'The Knights have been launching \nboats, even after it gets dark.<PAGE>Those guys are asking for trouble if \nthey try to get a boat out on the \nwater in the middle of the night.'
00272929:'The Knights are amateurs when it comes to the \nocean. They'd do well to hire some sailors who \nspecialize in this stuff. You know, like me.'
00272930:'You'll never see more stars than when \nyou're out on the ocean. There's hundreds \nof times more than in any city.<PAGE>Navigating the sea at night's not \nfor amateurs though, mind you.'
00272931:'You've never lived 'til you've seen \nthe night sky from out on the ocean.'
00272932:'Does that glittering land shine \neven in the dark of night?<PAGE>I'd love to go see for myself.'
00272933:'Is that island a product of all the disturbances \nthe world's been experiencing lately?'
00272934:'If the continents themselves \nwere to sink, what would \nall the people do?<PAGE>It's not like we could just pile everybody \ninto a bunch of boats...'
00272935:'Hey, we could build cities \non the ocean floor, and have \neverybody move down there.<PAGE>...Or maybe not.'
00272936:'......<PAGE>Unless you've got business with the magistrate, \nyou'd best show yourselves out.'
00272937:'Don't want to get yerselves hurt now, \ndo you? Then you'd be wise to beat it.'
00272938:'......<PAGE>The magistrate's sleeping. \nCome back tomorrow.'
00272939:'I don't think you want \nto see me angry.'
00272940:'......The magistrate's \nsleeping. Come \nback tomorrow.'
00272941:'Knock off that racket. Who \nthe hell are you, anyway?'
00272942:'......<PAGE>The magistrate? He went \nback to the capital. \nThe exit's that way.'
00272943:'I've got no time to \nplay games with you.'
00272944:'......<PAGE>The magistrate isn't \nin. Beat it.'
00272945:'I told you to beat \nit, so scram!'
00272946:'......<PAGE>No meeting with the magistrate \nafter dark. Beat it.'
00272947:'I'm tired, and that's got \nme in a bad mood. Next time \nI see you, you're dead!'
00272948:'......<PAGE>......'
00272949:'Yo punk... Just keep pressing \nyour luck... Find \nout what happens...'
00272950:'This is magistrate Ragou's mansion. \nThere's no entry at this hour, \neven if you've got permission.'
00272951:'I can't let you in, even if \nyou've been given permission.<PAGE>We've got strict instructions \nto admit no one while the \nmagistrate's sleeping.'
00272952:'Once we've been hired, we've got no choice \nto do what we've been paid for, no matter \nwhat sort of guy the magistrate might be.'
00272953:'If you've got business with the magistrate, \nwhy not use your head a little \nand come at a more normal hour?'
00272954:'Welcome, welcome. One night \nwill set you back 300 Gald.'
00272955:'<inn>Would you like to rest?'
00272956:'Thank you. Come stay \nwith us again.'

00272975:'Hah hah hah. Come on, take it easy. \nLife's too short to do anything \nbut slow down and enjoy the ride.'
00272976:'I'm frightened sometimes when I think about how \nrich I am. Oh my, I forgot that you all might \nbe poor. How terribly rude of me. Hah hah.'
00272977:'Hoh hoh, how long until \nwe set sail, I wonder.<PAGE>Surely 10 million Gald would convince \nthem to get started early.'
00272978:'I'm afraid 10 million \nGald is mere pocket change \nto me, hoh hoh.'
00272979:'Heh heh. If they refuse to \nlaunch the ship, I'll just \nhave to buy the helmsman.<PAGE>Or perhaps you don't think 100 million \nGald will be sufficient.'
00272980:'I'll feel the pinch of 100 million \nGald, to be sure, but what choice \ndo I have, really? Heh heh.'
00272981:'No matter how much money one has, if the boat \nwon't sail, there's no point worrying over \nit. Perhaps this is as it should be.<PAGE>Without such inconveniences, \nhow else could I experience \nthe lives of the \ncommon people?'
00272982:'Travel is a thing to be savored. \nIf you adopt this mindset, everything \ntakes on a special appeal.<PAGE>Though I will surely not stay here again, \neven this clap-board shack of an inn \nhas worked its quaint charms on me.<PAGE>I'm sure you agree. Perhaps \nthat's just what brought us \nto it in the first place.'
00272983:'We mustn't forget that Ragou's position \nas magistrate was not without its perils.<PAGE>I refer, of course, to the monsters he \ngathered to pursue his refined hobbies.<PAGE>His tastes may run to the eccentric, and \nhis vision, a bit grandiose, but he simply \nexercised the privilege of his station.'
00272984:'And now he's been branded a villain \nfor "abusing his authority" \nor some such nonsense.<PAGE>Honestly, the magistrate of this \ntown deserves our sympathies.<PAGE>Don't you think so, too? You \ndo, right? Don't you? Oh, \nsilly me, of course you do.'
00272985:'The chief of the guilds has died, they say. Everyone \nseems to be in quite a panic over it.<PAGE>But I ask you; can there be any \nsadness that exceeds this country's \ncurrent lack of an emperor?<PAGE>Praising the achievements of the deceased \nis one thing, but mourning their \nloss won't bring them back.'
00272986:'Those of us that remain must \ncarry on. It's really the only \nhope that we're left with.<PAGE>These people are so caught \nup in their weeping, they've \nforgotten this fact.<PAGE>We don't really need an emperor, when it comes \ndown to it. The empire will be just fine led \nby the Knights and the nobility alone.'
00272987:'The capital's a mess. Nobody'll \neven go near it, now. Man, \nwhat am I gonna do? <PAGE>When times are uncertain, \nyou've got to move on to \nthe next chapter.'
00272988:'What will become of my true-crime novel, \nthough...? Even I couldn't wait to \nsee what was gonna happen next.'
00272989:'At that very moment, word came \nthat the ship his friend had \nbeen aboard, had sunk!<PAGE>His dear companion's life stolen by none other than \nthe black shadow draped across the ocean's expanse! \nWhatever shall he do, meek and powerless as he is?!'
00272990:'As night bears down upon him, how shall \nhe find the light of a new day?!'
00272991:'Alone, save for the trusty blade \nat my side, I leap onto the \nfoul sky monster's back.<PAGE>A slash and a hack and \na blur of steel!<PAGE>In no time at all, the monster's \nhide has been rent, and I stand \nover the beast, victorious!'
00272992:'That's a sneak peek of the climactic finish. \nTune in next time for the final chapter!'
00272993:'Hmm? I don't remember \nthe continuation... \nUmm... <PAGE>Hmm? Outside? Ahh, it \nmade a loud sound. It \ndoesn't really matter. '

00272996:'Hmm, this started out as a nonfiction \nwork, but somewhere along the way \nit turned into a fantasy novel...'
00272997:'I have yet to shake the fear that grips \nmy heart, and it keeps me from sleeping.<PAGE>What happened in Zaphias \nwas just terrible.'
00272998:'I'll be all right, but \nI am deeply worried about \nmy child's future.'
00272999:'Everything was wonderful when we \nlived in the capital. I could help \nmake my son's dreams a reality.<PAGE>But how can he think \nof writing a novel at \na time such as this?'
00273000:'It goes to show how fragile we humans really are. \nIn the blink of an eye, our destiny, even the \nway we see the world can change for good.'
00273001:'The passion to work on a novel, \nwriting feverishly through the \nnight without sleeping...<PAGE>If only he could put such \nenergy to better use...'
00273002:'Ahh, I wish he'd turned out \na bit more like that young \ncaptain, Sir <STR>(FRE).'

00273077:'Those people in the capital have gotta be havin' a nasty time \nof it. Not that there's a whole lot we can do from here.'

00273080:'This town's fixin' ta bust at the seams, but \nit's nothin' ta get too worked up over.<PAGE>My guess is the Knights'll step in \nbefore things get too outta hand.'
00273081:'Heh, we'll be all right \nunless that thing decides \nta belly flop on us.'
00273082:'Heyo, you got any idea what the \ndeal is with that big ol' building \nis over toward Ilyccia?<PAGE>Sounds like that thing's so tall, the top of \nit's hidin' up there in the clouds somewhere.'
00273083:'Man, just what the heck is that thing? Ya think \nit's some sorta observation tower, maybe?'
00273084:'Our guild's hideout is \nway off on the western \nside of this continent.<PAGE>It's a little place called Dahngrest! \nYou should check it out sometime.'
00273085:'Come to think of it, the mercenaries had \na town somewhere up in the northwest. \nWait, they might've abandoned that one.'

00273088:'Fortune's Market has got the \nUnion to thank for their cozy \nrelationship with the empire.<PAGE>There's no telling if the guilds could even \nkeep going if the Don were ever to die, 'cause \nthe balance of power would just crumble...'
00273089:'The empire would bring the hammer down \non the guilds in no time at all.<PAGE>And if that happened, they'd \nstrengthen their hold even \non towns like this. '
00273090:'The death of the Don and Belius... I always thought \nif the two pillars of the guild community \nfell, the empire would crush us in no time.<PAGE>I never thought it'd cause this \nrebellion among the Knights...'
00273091:'This should buy the guilds some time to \nrecover from the loss, and get ready to \npush back against the empire if need be.'
00273092:'Knights fighting other Knights, huh...? \nSounds like the empire's got pretty \nbig problems of its own.<PAGE>And the Union can't seem to agree \non anything, now that they've got \nnobody to bind them together.'
00273093:'With the Don out of the picture, \nmaybe this is a time for major \nchanges in the guilds.'
00273094:'Perhaps you were unaware, but this \nis a tropical species of plant particular \nto the Tolbyccian continent.<PAGE>It is quite common for heavy \nrains to fall here, you see.'
00273095:'If you proceed further to the west, \nyou will surely guess this continent's \ndefining character.'
00273096:'This continent sees quite a lot of \nrainfall, but conversely, the continent \nof Desier sees almost none.'
00273097:'With Desier as hot as it is, \nits lack of rain makes the \nclimate doubly harsh.'
00273098:'Have you ever been to the \ndeserts of Desier? Oh, you \nhave? How remarkable.'
00273099:'Is it true that the \ncactuses there are \na source of water?'

00273107:'This is no time to be thinking about how \nmuch it might rain in a given place.'
00273108:'The Empire? The Guilds?<PAGE>Looking at that awful thing in the sky \nmakes the little borders men fashion \nfor themselves seem so ridiculous.'
00273109:'Even so, I'm staying with the Guild. \nJust the sad saga of a man who can't \nlive without his borders...'
00273110:'What's to be done \nwith the world now? <PAGE>There isn't a single person left among the elite of the Guilds or the \nKnights who can tackle that question.'
00273111:'All us bottom-\nfeeders can do \nis worry...'
00273112:'This is Fortune Market's \nhome office.'

00273120:'This is Fortune Market's \nhome office.'

00273129:'Barbos was domineering, arrogant, \nand selfish, but he was \ncertainly an able man. <PAGE>I'd like to know who \ncould take down that \nkind of a man.'
00273130:'In the past, the mercenaries \nwould always go out to do \ntheir work when night fell.'
00273131:'I wonder how much this town's been changed \nby the absence of the Blood Alliance.'
00273132:'Sounds like something pretty big happened in \nthe capital, but it doesn't look like it's got \nanything to do with us here in Torim Harbor.'
00273133:'I'm curious to see how the Union's going \nto manage now that they've lost the Don.'
00273134:'I hear the empire's having to deal with \nsome sort of internal problems.'
00273135:'Which reminds me, I also heard someone \nsay that a young knight's been cooperating \nwith one or another of the guilds.'

00273578:'The blastia we're digging \nup here were made by the \nKrityans eons ago.'
00273579:'Just once I'd like to have a nice, long \ntalk with one of the Krityan technicians \nabout blastia construction.'
00273580:'Halure? Yeah, it's known for having the textbook \nexample of an organic-type blastia.<PAGE>What about it?'
00273581:'We spend all our time inside the city, so \nwe're a bit out of touch with the world.<PAGE>Not that I'm dying to know what's happening out there.'
00273582:'Saying that though, somebody had to \nput all these blastia we're digging \nup into the ground at some point...<PAGE>I wonder if it was done for some special reason?'
00273583:'Hey, would you mind leaving \nme alone? I'm busy thinking \nabout blastia right now.'
00273584:'Why would they bury \nthe blastia...? \nHmm, I wonder.<PAGE>...Did they become unusable? \nBut how could that happen?'
00273585:'How could they just give up using \nsomething that brings such convenience \nand abundance to our lives...?'
00273586:'Wait, what's up with this? These numbers \ncan't be right! There's something \nfishy about the recent data!!<PAGE>All my work, my precious work!!'
00273587:'Astounding. These results will overturn \nsomething people have been accepting as \nfact for far too long. It's incredible!!'
00273588:'I've heard news that a vandal got into the ruins to the southeast. \nThat place has been checked from top to bottom, though.<PAGE>I can't imagine they'd \nfind much there.'

00273591:'Do you mind giving me some space? I'm right \nin the middle of puzzling out the connection \nbetween organics and the human body.'
00273592:'Your bodhi blastia sure \nare an interesting color.'
00273593:'You must really have used \nyour blastia a lot for them \nto develop that much.'
00273594:'The sky above the capital seems to be a peculiar color. \nI'd like to go have a look at it myself. I just need \nto make some progress on this research first.'

00273597:'On second thought, it might be the \nblastia that are causing the earthquakes... \nWait, can that be it?'

00273668:'They say the stones of the duelling grounds have \nbeen wet with blood since the day they were set \ndown. Isn't that a lurid way of putting it?'

00273673:'The Empire couldn't destroy this \ntown even if they wanted to.<PAGE>Why not? It's simple. The big names \nfrom the Empire come here to \nhave fun like everyone else.'
00273674:'In fact, I bet they'd like to snatch \nthis city away from Palestralle \nand run it under their auspices.'
00273675:'You can see some giant shadow \nof a monster in the sky, but we're \nprotected by the barrier.<PAGE>You know those huge pillars surrounding \nthe city? Those are Nordopolica's \nbarrier blastia.'
00273676:'Apparently, most of the citizens \ndon't even know that those \nare their barrier blastia.'
00273677:'Yo! Are you guys here to \nget a glimpse of some spectacular \nbattling action?<PAGE>Tournament tickets are made \nof platinum, so they're pretty \nhard to get a hold of.'

00273680:'What? You were the challenger? \n...If you're trying to tell \na joke, you should try again.'
00273681:'*Grumble, grumble...* Don't \ntalk to me, man...<PAGE>The coliseum being shut down \nis totally stressing me out... \n*Grumble, grumble.*'
00273682:'Sheesh. So they let the monsters \nget out, and now the town's in a \npanic... *Grumble, grumble...*'
00273683:'The Duce was killed? No way \nPalestralle is going to \nstay quiet on this one.<PAGE>It's going to be all-out war. \nWhat a sight that'll be...'
00273684:'So, who's the killer supposed \nto be? It'd be nice to know who \nthey'll be going to war with.'
00273685:'Sheesh. Those damned Knights're so uptight \nand serious about everything.<PAGE>They should go and watch the tournaments. \nMaybe then they'd loosen up a little.'
00273686:'Man, is this ever boring. What the hell \nmade these Knights such sticks in the \nmud? That's what I'd like to know.'
00273687:'Just what's the fuss over this \nmonster in the sky, anyway?<PAGE>If you got all the heavy-hitters in this \ntown together, there's nothing in this world \nso scary that they couldn't handle it.'
00273688:'Quit hangin' around up there! \nWhy don't you come down here \nand show us what you've got?!'
00273689:'First we get monsters in the \nsky, and next it's this weird \ntower. Aspio, was it?<PAGE>That thing actually looks sort \nof like a monster, too.'
00273690:'What is it with monsters today, and all their conniving \nlittle tricks...? Whatever happened to solving things \nwith a good old fashioned knock down, drag out brawl?!'
00273691:'*Sigh...* Nothing like a quiet night to soothe \nthe wearied soul... Want some tips?<PAGE>Excuse me if I'm not overly excited. \nYou're my only customers so far.'
00273692:'My predictions just don't seem \nto hit the mark, lately...'

00273702:'Whoa, this isn't good... Now I've \nstarted questioning what I'm \nreally doing with my life...'
00273703:'This old man is listening so intently, \nI have to wonder if this tipster might \nnot actually be on to something.<PAGE>I've never thought of placing \na bet before, but maybe \nI should give it a try.'
00273704:'But just what is he \ndoing in the betting \nbusiness, anyway?<PAGE>If he really thinks he can pick \nthe winners, why doesn't he keep \nthe information all to himself?'
00273705:'Hoh hoh, I've got it. It must be that \nit sounds like a bunch of hooey, but \nthat there's actually a logic to it.<PAGE>Maybe his predictions come \ntrue after all... I think \nI might give it a try...'
00273706:'Just when you think a person is nothing \nmore than a muscle-bound simpleton, they \nturn out to be quite intelligent.<PAGE>Never judge a book by \nits cover, I suppose.'
00273707:'Listen to this. I made 200,000 \nGald just by following the \nadvice this man gave me!<PAGE>Oh, Itoken, thank goodness \nI believed in you!'
00273708:'I'm putting 500,000 Gald on his \nnext hot tip to win it big!<PAGE>The sky's the limit!'

00273711:'Oh, my heart is breaking... \nBecause the Duce died...?<PAGE>Hell no! I just flushed 500,000 \nGald down the drain!'
00273712:'Oh the sadness... It's just \ntoo much for me to bear...'

00273714:'The sky? I've got no time for that right \nnow. My life is on the line here...!'

00273720:'This noble woman here is really \nlayin' down the big bucks. Maybe \nI should take a chance myself.<PAGE>Just think how great it'd be if \nI could pay off all that debt.'
00273721:'He just predicted a bet that \npaid 500,000 to one...<PAGE>Damn, I'm a fool! Of course \nthis is the one and only time \nI don't put money down.'
00273722:'That noble woman's bet \njust paid off...<PAGE>Maybe she'd spare a few Gald \nfor a poor old man...'

00273727:'There, ya see? Missed again... This tipster's \nnothin' but a lump of bad luck.<PAGE>Still, my luck's gotta turn sometime, right? I swear, \nI envy anyone too stupid to do what I'm doing.'
00273728:'When I stop and think about it, this crook \nof a tipster's not losin' out at all.<PAGE>His predictions might be off, but \nhe's still takin' our money.'
00273729:'I'm at the end of life's road anyway. If I can \nstrike it rich just once more, I'll have a nice \nsouvenir to take with me to the next world.<PAGE>But it'll never pay off. \nThis darned tipster knows \njust what I'm thinkin'.'
00273730:'The time of reckoning's at hand. If it's \nall goin' up in flames anyway, why \nshould I be afraid to go bankrupt?'

00273750:'All my worries about my husband \ngo up in smoke once the \nmatch begins, though.'
00273751:'The town is just clogged with battleships. \nAnd it's filled to the brim with Knights.<PAGE>I'd thought this place would be different \nfrom the capital, but they're pretty \nmuch the same, after all.'
00273752:'In this sort of situation, it's \nhaving the coliseum that makes \nliving here worthwhile.'
00273753:'I may not be from here originally, \nbut I've quite settled in, and I've \neven made plenty of friends.<PAGE>My greatest pleasure is \nstill the coliseum though, \nwithout a doubt. '

00273755:'What is that now, \nin the sky?<PAGE>Ilyccia's off in that direction. Do you \nthink the capital's all right? Husband...'
00273756:'I'm worried about the husband \nI left behind in the capital...'
00273757:'I've decided to return to the capital. And when \nI get back here, my husband will be with me.<PAGE>He'd be much better off \ncoming here than staying \nthere all alone.'
00273758:'I like going to the matches by myself, \nbut perhaps I'd enjoy the coliseum even \nmore if he were here to watch with me.'
00273759:'Ooh, I just had a great idea. \nWhy not pit knights against \nguildsmen in the coliseum?<PAGE>Now, wouldn't that be exciting?∀'

00273796:'I’ve seen that monster before... \nMan, if that thing goes off on one, \nit’s gonna get real serious real quick.'
00273797:'Just what was that monster I \nsaw in coliseum before...?<PAGE>While it was certainly terrifying, there \nwas an even stronger sense of...holiness \nabout it that gave me the chills.'
00273798:'It very well may have \nbeen this town's \nguardian spirit.'
00273799:'The air takes on a rarified quality at night, \nand has a disquieting odor about it.<PAGE>Sixth sense? It's nothing so superficial \nas that. Ill tidings are brewing \nthough, mark my words...'

00273802:'Hey, don't get bent outta shape. The monsters \nhere are the real thing, even if they \nare for use in the tournaments.<PAGE>Don't be surprised if an enemy \nyou're familiar with lays \nthe hurt on you here.'
00273803:'You guys are travelers, right? Lemme \ntell you straight up, this continent \nain't worth your time.<PAGE>There's a road, but it dead ends at a mountain. There's a \ncave too, but it's chock-full of monsters. Plus, there's nothing \nbut sand and jagged peaks waitin' on the other side.'
00273804:'There's a town out there they \ncall an oasis, but it's \njust another sand pit. <PAGE>Look, I won't say any more. \nYou best get back on your ship \nand go home to mama, huh?'
00273805:'Man, I don't like the looks \nof all these Knights bargin' \nin here like this.<PAGE>Most people out here have a strong \ndislike for the empire, so there could \nbe trouble waitin' in the wings.'

00273807:'You say Belius has died? Okay, now \nthings are gonna get interesting.<PAGE>Belius' existence was the thing that \nreally kept this town together.'
00273808:'Those Knights just keep on pouring in, one right \nafter the other, don't they? Wonder how Palestralle's \ngonna dig themselves outta this one.<PAGE>This is awful, but it's also awesome. \nI'm gonna be so busy, hah hah.'
00273809:'What's all this? Everybody seems to have \nquieted down a fair bit. Boring, I say.<PAGE>Or maybe it's that the Knights are \nputtin' their fears at ease.'
00273810:'The people here turned out \nto have even less fight in 'em \nthan I'd have guessed. <PAGE>I also assumed Belius \nhad much more of a \nfollowing than this.'
00273811:'Ah hah hah. Now where the hell do you \nsuppose a monster like that comes from. \nNice, this is shapin' up nicely.<PAGE>What's that? The end of the world? \nHah hah, aw heck, why not?'
00273812:'They can wipe this town, or even \nthe whole ball of wax clean off \nthe map for all I care. Hmph.'
00273813:'It sounds like there's a fair \nbit of trouble over on Ilyccia.<PAGE>We've got both the sea and the sky getting \ninto the act now. How festive. I've got \nit, let's have a parade! Ah hah hah!'
00273814:'...Okay even I can't keep it up anymore. \nJust what was I going on about, anyway?<PAGE>I feel like I'll have to \nface all my fears if I don't \nkeep blabbering on...'
00273815:'The monster that guarded over \nthis town has been vanquished.<PAGE>If those who did this truly belong \nto one of the Union's guilds, \nthey are a barbaric lot indeed.'
00273816:'If that truly was the \nguardian spirit then \nthis town is doomed.'
00273817:'They say it was the \nguardian deity that \nkilled Duce Belius. <PAGE>I suppose it wasn't our \nguardian at all...just \na common monster.'
00273818:'Now we've lost both Belius and the guardian \nspirit. It's hopeless to think we can \nrely on the Knights to protect us here.'
00273819:'Natz is doing his best \nto fill in as provisional \nDuce of Nordopolica.<PAGE>Unlike Belius, he appears before \nthe people frequently, and \nfeels closer to us somehow.'
00273820:'He lacks some of Belius' \ncharisma, though we \nsaw much less of her.'
00273821:'Natz is pouring his heart into the \nwork of keeping this town safe.<PAGE>Now the people need to rally \nbehind him as one.'
00273822:'There isn't much I know of other towns. \nBut I'll be satisfied if Nordopolica \ncan be at peace, of that I'm sure.'
00273823:'I came to Desier to explore the lands \nto the west of here and search \nfor my heritage as a Krityan.<PAGE>But the road through the \nmountains is out, and \nI was denied passage.'
00273824:'If only I could conquer that mountain \nroad somehow, the way forward after that \nshould be flat and fairly easygoing.<PAGE>At least according to my map.'
00273825:'There will surely be greater trials \nto face before I can finally discover \nmy roots as a Krityan.<PAGE>Even if I were to cross the mountains, \nfor example, a perilous desert spreads \nout beyond its far side.'
00273826:'The only people likely to enter a desert \nare pioneering settlers, those with a severe \ncase of wanderlust, and the insane.'
00273827:'I'm considering postponing my quest \nfor the origins of the Kritya \nand staying here for a while.<PAGE>Belius, the Duce of Nordopolica, \nhas expressed a desire \nin meeting me.'
00273828:'If all goes well, I may end up \nbeing able to work for the Duce \ndirectly in some capacity.'
00273829:'Hoh hoh hoh.<PAGE>What the... *Pant* \nHeck are you... *Wheeze* \nDoing...?'
00273830:'Whooee. I'd like to \nenter the tournament \none of these days.<PAGE>I'm right in the middle of my training regimen. \nYou've gotta toughen yourself up beforehand, see?'
00273831:'Hoh hoh hoh... *Gasp, wheeze...* \nI've been doing this \nsame run so much... *Pant* \nThat it's boring me \nto tears... Wonder \nwhat I should do...'
00273832:'Phew. Suppose I could head out of town... \nOn second thought... I don't really \nwant to tangle with the monsters...'
00273833:'Hoh hoh hoh... *Huff, \npuff...* Those Knights \nare such a bother... \n*Gasp* Come on, stop \nlooking over here... I-it's \nembarrassing...'
00273834:'...What do they need the \nKnights for, anyway? They've \ngot us, don't they...?'
00273835:'*Huff*...*huff*... I'm doing my \nbest to build up stamina \nhere, and Belius up and dies?<PAGE>If they stop the tournaments...\n*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...\nThis will all have been...for nothing...'
00273836:'Phew. Cados is under blockade, not \nto mention any travel by boat. And \nthe mountain road is out to boot.<PAGE>Nordopolica's been sealed \noff tighter than a clam...'
00273837:'Don don don dooooon!! Nooo... Oh my \ngosh, man... The Don, I can't believe \nthe Don is dead and gone...!<PAGE>How will I...ever \nexpress my grief?!'
00273838:'If only I'd \nbeen in Dahngrest...<PAGE>Don! Don, I never would've let you die! Don don don dooooon!!'
00273839:'*Wheeze...* Just because the Don's \npassed away, *Pant* There's no excuse \nto go on pouting forever...<PAGE>*Gasp* Now I'm training in order to \nsend that blasted monster back where \nit came from. *...Huff, puff*'
00273840:'Phew... Wonder how buff I need to \nbecome before I've got a real shot \nat taking down that monster...'
00273841:'*Gasp, wheeze...* Oh, I'm nowhere near \nfinished... *Huff, puff* I've gotta keep \non running... For tomorrow's sake...'
00273842:'Whew... The road to victory \nis long a long and perilous \none, huh...?'
00273843:'This town is ruled autonomously \nby the guild, Palestralle. Their \nBoss is a woman known as Belius.<PAGE>The people here refer to \nher as the Duce though, \nas a show of respect.'
00273844:'As wide as this world may be, \nPalestralle is the only guild \nthat commands an entire city.<PAGE>In the case of Dahngrest, the \npower's shared between the \nDon and the Union, you see.'
00273845:'The coliseum building is divided into three \nparts. The commercial district, the residential \ndistrict, and the coliseum proper.<PAGE>To maintain public order, outsiders \nare strictly forbidden to \ntake up residence here.'
00273846:'I've heard that if one takes up official residency in this town, \nit's possible to live in the coliseum's residential district.<PAGE>Not that there's any guarantee \nlife would be more interesting \nif you once you moved in.'
00273847:'They say the new moon turns \nthe monsters used in the coliseum \nparticularly fierce.<PAGE>So, as a precaution, Palestralle keeps \nan extra-sharp watch on their monsters, \non nights before a new moon arrives.'
00273848:'I happened to be in the coliseum right \nwhen the reverse barrier that contains \nthe monsters went down.<PAGE>It was frightening, to be sure, but it \nhappened when the moon ws full, so the \nmonsters we actually quite subdued.'
00273849:'The coliseum city is \ncompletely independent \nfrom the Empire.<PAGE>That's partly thanks to it being located \nso far from Ilyccia, where Zaphias is.'
00273850:'You can be sure the people of this town \nare allowing the Knights to maintain \na presence here only grudgingly.'
00273851:'It turns out that this provisional Duce, \nNatz, was the one actually managing \nPalestralle's business affairs.<PAGE>Accordingly, Belius' death hasn't \nposed any real hindrances to the \nguild's financial operations.'
00273852:'Belius was a crucial support to the \nmorale of the town. The gravity of her \nloss should not be underestimated.'
00273853:'The Knights are now without a Commandant, \nand what's more, their presence in each \nof the world's regions is faltering.<PAGE>It can't belong before control \nof Nordopolica is returned \nto Palestralle completely.'
00273854:'Most likely something will need to be \ndone about this monster in the sky before \nsuch a thing can happen, though.'
00273855:'See that headless statue, there? Apparently, \nthat's the patron goddess of warriors \nknown as the "benevolent mother."<PAGE>It was built nearly 800 years ago, \nbut the head was lost when a massive \nwave crashed against the town.'
00273856:'Perhaps we too should pray before \nthe goddess. For our own well-being, \nand for the peace of this world.'
00273857:'Hey, hey. Why is \nthat statue missing \nits face?<PAGE>Do you think maybe someone \ncame and took it?'
00273858:'Is it supposed to be a woman? If they \nmade a statue of her, she must have \nbeen really pretty in real life.<PAGE>Aww. I wish somebody \nwould make a \nstatue of me.'
00273859:'If you go out of the town and then go west, \nyou'll find a cave called the Cados.<PAGE>Everybody tells me it's super \ndangerous, and that I should \nnever go in there, though.'
00273860:'When the wind blows through \nthe cave, it sounds just like \na whistle. Tweet, tweet.♪<PAGE>So it's also called the Cados \nWeasand, or something.'
00273861:'The monsters got out at the coliseum. I guess \nthe reverse barrier isn't very strong.<PAGE>I hope they don't come \nand get me while I'm \nsleeping at night...'
00273862:'The barrier around the town keeps monsters \nout, but the reverse barrier got its name because \nit's used to keep monsters inside it.'
00273863:'Are these Knights \nour enemies, or \nour friends?<PAGE>They beat up the monsters, \nbut the grown-ups still \ndon't look very happy.'
00273864:'I for one hope they're \nour friends.<PAGE>I mean, it would \nbe bad if we had this \nmany enemies.'
00273865:'Miss Belius died, but I'd never \neven seen her before so \nI'm not sure how to feel.<PAGE>With the Knights here now, at least it'll \nbe peaceful for the time being, right?'
00273866:'I also heard that a man \nnamed Don died, too.<PAGE>That's another person I'd \nnever seen before. I wonder \nwhere he was from?'
00273867:'What's that thing in the \nsky? It's moving, isn't \nit? Is it alive?<PAGE>Is that our...enemy?'
00273868:'At least we have \nthe Knights here.<PAGE>They'll protect \nus, right?'
00273869:'I heard the grown-ups say that the \nwhole world is in a big mess.<PAGE>But it's okay, because we'll \nall protect this town together. \nSo, I'm not afraid at all!'
00273870:'Actually, the sky's so high up there, \nthat I can't really understand it.<PAGE>I wonder if that thing's \nreally dangerous.'
00273871:'No moon in the sky... \nand the new moon...\nI get the feeling something’s going to happen.<PAGE>Though a premonition is nothing more than that, \nI’m sure feeling a mixture of anxiety and hope... '
00273872:'It seems that Belius only \nmeets people at the new moon.<PAGE>Maybe I should \nvisit her later... '
00273873:'I can't believe Duce Belius \nis dead... We were supposed to meet \nand have all manner of discussions.<PAGE>What an unfortunate twist of fate. \nIt was such a promising chance...'
00273874:'This must be a message from the heavens: \n"Go and discover the origin of the Kritya"...'
00273875:'I've had Lord Natz\narrange for me to work at \nthe coliseum's library.<PAGE>It's quite befitting a city of such history. \nThere are enough books there to \nsatisfy any Kritya's thirst for knowledge.'
00273876:'I may even be able to \ndiscover our origins without \never having to go beyond those mountains.'
00273877:'I once saw an image that \nlooked very much like that \nominous shadow in the sky.<PAGE>It must have been in one of the \nbooks in my parents' room, \nwhen I was very young...'
00273878:'I get the feeling we \nKritya somehow have a very \ndeep connection to that beast in the sky...'
00273879:'Long ago, the clans of old and \nthe human ruling class stood in partnership, \nunited through Kritya mediation.<PAGE>This may finally \nbe our time to stand up.'
00273880:'Yes, I remember now. \nIt was in a passage in one \nof my parents' books.<PAGE>Be it lies or truth, \nI believe this is a duty \nassigned to our people.'
00273881:'An accident has occurred within \nthe coliseum, and we are in the \nprocess of attending to it.<PAGE>It is our sworn duty to defend all towns \nthat lay within reach of the empire.'
00273882:'We will assure the safety \nof this town.'
00273883:'It is possible that a number of the monsters \nhave escaped to the residential \ndistrict, and remain there still.<PAGE>We will stay until we can be completely \nsure of the town's safety.'
00273884:'We will assure the safety \nof this town.'
00273885:'The people of this town seem \nto chafe at our presence, but \nwe must fulfill our duty.<PAGE>If they choose not to accept us, well \nthat is ultimately not our concern.'
00273886:'No matter how the townspeople may \nfeel, we must stand by our posts \nuntil our work here is finished.'
00273887:'We have our duties to perform. Whatever \nmay be happening in the sky can \nnot sway us from that task.'
00273888:'If anything should threaten the order \nof this town, we must apply the full \nmeasure of our force against it.'
00273889:'Sometimes the citizens\nwould greet us.<PAGE>I'm not sure what made them open\ntheir hearts to us, but I hope they\nunderstand our good intentions...'
00273890:'The other day, an old \nwoman left some steamed \nbuns with us.<PAGE>They were piping-hot and actually \nquite delicious...'
00273891:'Thankfully, not many people are out and about at \nnight... At least then I can be free from the scorn \ntheir eyes show whenever they look at us...<PAGE>I can understand that they weren't \noverjoyed to see us, but...this \nhurts a little...'
00273892:'We came here for what we understood \nto be the cause of good...'
00273893:'A citizen threw a rock at \nme... Then he dared me to \ntry and arrest him...<PAGE>I wish it were that \nsimple for me, you \nknow, emotionally.'
00273894:'Maybe I'm just not cut out \nto be a Knight after all.<PAGE>It might be time to start looking for another job...'
00273895:'Captain Schwann is far too busy... \n*Mumble, mumble...* So the Lieutenant \ndoes his job... Oh...<PAGE>Zzz... Sir \nLeblanc...'
00273896:'Any suspicious behavior from you... \n*Mumble, mumble...* And I'll take\nyou into custody...'
00273897:'We've come here... *Mumble, mumble...* \nto assist the \n<STR>(FRE) Brigade... <PAGE>Zzz... Ooh, you're \nunder arrest...'
00273898:'As long as we d-d-do our best... \n*Mumble, mumble...* Everyone \nwill be happy...'
00273899:'Late night visitors, I see.\nWelcome to Nordopolica's\nhotel facility.<PAGE>The cost is 500 Gald per night. \nWill you be staying with us?'

00273902:'A few days ago, \na few suspicious looking \ncharacters arrived at the inn.<PAGE>Those guys are knights, weren’t they? \nThey just left, \nwearing knight’s armor.'
00273903:'Why have they come \nto this town?<PAGE>They were standing around town \nwearing normal clothes, they \ntricked us the swine!'
00273904:'If the guys that stayed \nhere were knights, I should \nhave set up a little tourist-trap...'

00273983:'This town is a treasure trove of \ninformation. We have its long and \nstoried history to thank for that.<PAGE>The more I study, the more \nthe machinations of this \nworld grow clear to me.'
00273984:'The empire claims a history of roughly eight \ncenturies, but this town far exceeds that, \nhaving been founded some 1200 years ago.<PAGE>And to think that it all began with the \nstone slabs of the original coliseum.'
00273985:'If you head from here for twenty or thirty kilometers \nin a westerly direction,you will hit a high and steep mountain range \nknown to us as the Mother Cados mountains.<PAGE>It's quite a meaningful name, \nbut it's only used by \nthis town's folk.'
00273986:'Once you have passed the Mother Cados mountains, \nyou will hit the Sands of Kogorh, but you’re going to need some serious \npreparations before getting over those mountains!'
00273987:'The Knights went rushing into \nthe coliseum for some reason...<PAGE>It would seem that something \nquite serious is happening.'
00273988:'This city is truly fascinating...as much for its historical value as it \nis for being the gathering place of so many rough-and-tumble types.<PAGE>It seems like such a dichotomy, but \nthe two unite here in Nordopolica.'
00273989:'Duce Belius? I haven't yet had the \nhonor of meeting her, but it seems as \nif she has some interest in Kritya.<PAGE>I don't know \nwhy, however.'
00273990:'This descendant of an ancient \nclan, the woman who governs \na city of such contrasts...<PAGE>Yes, the woman called \nBelius interests \nme greatly.'
00273991:'It is for the best that the \nKnights are here to maintain \norder in the town.<PAGE>I'm not certain I feel the same way \nabout that battleship, though.'
00273992:'One small misstep, and \nthose warships could destroy \nthis entire town.<PAGE>What a terrible blow to \nhistory the loss of this \nripe old city would be.'
00273993:'Duce Belius has passed away... \nNow is the time for mourning.<PAGE>The death of a person is a great loss. \nIt is also a rite of passage for \nthose of us who remain behind.'
00273994:'Death is one thing we \ncannot simply pretend \nhas not occurred.<PAGE>The coming weeks will be a time \nof trial for this town.'
00273995:'If that abomination were to attack this \ncity with its full strength, I doubt \nthe barrier would be of any help.<PAGE>Could this be the end \ntimes for humanity...?'
00273996:'If that abomination were to attack this \ncity with its full strength, I doubt \nthe barrier would be of any help.<PAGE>Could this be the end \ntimes for humanity...?'
00273997:'I've got a friend who moved to the \nresidential district here, and \nI've come to pay him a visit.<PAGE>For whatever reason though, \nthey won't let me in...'
00273998:'After coming all this way I was \ndead set on seeing the \ntournament, but it's sold out...<PAGE>Sheesh, way to kick a guy when he's \ndown. What the heck am I gonna do if \nmy luck gets any worse than this?'
00273999:'Just when I thought I'd finally get to \nmeet my friend, I'm told the place is \nclosed to anyone who's not a resident.<PAGE>Do I seriously have to spend \nanother night in the inn?'
00274000:'It's not like I'm made of money, or something. I've \ngotta save enough for my passage back to the capital. \nMan, nothing ever goes the way you think it will...'
00274001:'Those Knights are surprisingly stingy. I \nasked one of them to loan me some Gald seeing \nas I'm broke, and he wouldn't do it.<PAGE>I thought the Knights were \nsupposed to help the people \nin their times of need.'
00274002:'I mean, at least they could \nstand to give a guy enough \nfor a bite to eat.'
00274003:'That battleship's gonna be headed back \nto the capital sooner or later, right?<PAGE>So why can't they give \nme a ride for at least \npart of the way, then?'
00274004:'Those nights are surprisingly... Forget \nit, I'm done being surprised. They're \njust straight-up stingy.'
00274005:'Here they're dealing with the death of Belius, \nand in Dahngrest it's the death of the Don.<PAGE>If I had to guess, I'd say that the \nCommandant of the Knights'll be the \nnext one to have his ticket punched.'
00274006:'But if all three of them \nwere to die, who'd be \nleft to run this world?<PAGE>We'd really be in a bind \nif that happened...'
00274007:'So the monster in the sky is \nhovering over Ilyccia, huh?<PAGE>Man, I'm so glad I came to this town... \nAnd that I was too broke to go home.'
00274008:'It's not like I can just stay here forever, \nthough... My friend's being a real \njerk anyway. Tough breaks, huh...?'
00274009:'First we get that freaky monster, and \nthen up comes this massive tower.<PAGE>Just what's the deal, here? Is \nthis world gonna be all right?'
00274010:'Man, my head feels like it's full of rocks. \nI can't keep up with all this stuff.'
00274011:'This is the world's one and only coliseum. \nThere's plenty of folks who come from far \nand wide just to catch a glimpse of it.<PAGE>You look like you've come a pretty long way yourselves. \n'Course anybody could tell that, seein' as \nyou're lookin' a bit on the scruffy side.'
00274012:'The coliseum is massive enough to not \nonly hold a crowd of spectators, but an \nentire residential district as well.<PAGE>As you can see, we have a market, \nan inn...the coliseum is \nreally one giant city.'
00274013:'Why are there \nKnights in this town?<PAGE>If we leave it as it is, the discipline\nwe worked hard to build in the\ncoliseum will collapse!'
00274014:'We protect this \ntown ourselves, \nno matter what!<PAGE>We’ve managed \nalright so far without \nthe Empire’s help.'
00274015:'In this town, we've worked things out so that \nthe guild Palestralle stands on equal footing \nwith the regular folks that live here.<PAGE>We're not into that absolute government \nstuff they force on people \nin the imperial capital.'
00274016:'The coliseum is massive enough to not \nonly hold a crowd of spectators, but an \nentire residential district as well.<PAGE>As you can see, we have a market, \nan inn...the coliseum is \nreally one giant city.'
00274017:'Why are there Knights \nin this town?<PAGE>If we leave it as it is, the discipline \nwe worked hard to build in \nthe coliseum will collapse!'
00274018:'We protect this \ntown ourselves, \nno matter what!<PAGE>We’ve managed \nalright so far without \nthe Empire’s help.'
00274019:'This city is built upon the idea \nof its citizens having equal \nstatus with Palestralle.<PAGE>We don't submit to absolute \nrule of the Empire's \nkind here.'
00274020:'That fact is the pride of every man, \nwoman and child in Nordopolica.<PAGE>Of course, outsiders seem to have \na hard time understanding it.'
00274021:'I'm astounded they let Imperial Knights in. Not \nto worry, though...Palestralle and the warriors \nfrom the coliseum are all tough cookies.<PAGE>They'll have the Knights \nthrown out in no time.'
00274022:'Duce Belius would never \npermit Imperial Knights entry \nin the first place...'
00274023:'On a night with no moon, \nit’s darker than usual, \nmakes me feel uneasy.<PAGE>The monsters are getting restless, \nand I’m getting more and \nmore uneasy... '
00274024:'This may be an uneasy night, \nbut this town should be defended \nby the Guildsmen of Palestralle.<PAGE>We don’t need \nthe Knight’s help.'
00274025:'What in the world is going \non? Duce Belius is \ndead? It can't be true!<PAGE>What's going to happen \nto this city if Duce \nBelius dies?'
00274026:'This city will be finished \nwithout Duce Belius...!'
00274027:'Those schemin' Knights. They say they're \nhere to provide security, but I know \nit's their plan to take over.<PAGE>Belius would never stand \nfor such tyranny...'
00274028:'But Belius has gone \nand left us behind...'
00274029:'I'm a member of Palestralle, the \nguild that governs this city.<PAGE>I'm on patrol tonight, \nas usual.'
00274030:'If I spot anyone actin' \nfishy, I sentence them to \na swift butt kicking.'
00274031:'What’s that? \nSome Knights are heading \nto the coliseum?<PAGE>Lurking like thieves in the night! \nHiding here all along!'
00274032:'Huh? It's... It's not a guy? \nIt's a place? Like a city? <PAGE>So bring 'em all on! All of \nus in Palestralle will rip \nevery last one of 'em apart'
00274033:'I'm a member of Palestralle, the \nguild that governs this city.<PAGE>I'm on patrol tonight, \nas usual.'
00274034:'If I spot anyone actin' \nfishy, I sentence them to \na swift butt kicking.'
00274035:'What’s that? \nSome Knights are heading \nto the coliseum?<PAGE>They must have \nsnuck in under the \ncover of darkness!'
00274036:'What happened?\nWhat are all these\nknights doing here?!'
00274037:'So they've finally gone and done \nit, huh? Those Union dogs...<PAGE>That Don had been waitin' \nfor his chance to take out \nthe Duce all along!'
00274038:'We can take on\nthese monsters if\nwe joined forces.'
00274039:'Heh heh. That's right, man. \nI live in this town.<PAGE>Neat, huh? Pretty amazing, \nright? It's okay \nto be jealous.'
00274040:'Someday, I'm gonna be as strong \nas that guy Kratos, and I'll \nbe a hero of the tournaments.<PAGE>Not even you guys could \nbeat Kratos. He's the \ntoughest in the world!'
00274041:'Yeah! Woo hoo! The champion \nof the coliseum is \ntotally awesome!<PAGE>I heard his name's \n<STR>(FRE)! Knights \nare so cool!'
00274042:'If I become a Knight, will \nI get that strong and be able \nto win that many fights?'
00274043:'Those Knights were so cool. They took down all \nthe monsters in the coliseum, just like that.<PAGE>That horn's pretty \nsweet, too.♪'
00274044:'You never can be too sure about people \nwho don't have horns, I always say.'
00274045:'Hey, hey, are the Knights bad \nguys, or something? That's \nwhat the grown-ups said.<PAGE>It's too bad that the cool-looking \nguys have to be the bad ones.'
00274046:'I guess it's okay to have cool-looking \nvillains too, though.'
00274047:'The town's quieted down thanks \nto the work the Knights did.<PAGE>That settles it, they're cool in my book. \n...Woops... If my mom hears me say \nthat, she'll box my ears for sure.'
00274048:'I guess not everyone's as big a fan \nof the Knights as I am, huh? I guess \nthat's 'cause they're bad guys.'
00274049:'Forget being a hero of the coliseum, \nI'm gonna be a hero of the Knights!<PAGE>That sounds way more fun, anyway. \nWonder if Mom will let me.'
00274050:'I've gotta start saving money \nso I can go to the capital...<PAGE>Oh wait, I forgot \nI've gotta grow \nup first...'
00274051:'Forget being a hero of the coliseum, \nI'm gonna be a hero of the Knights!<PAGE>That sounds way more fun, anyway. \nWonder if Mom will let me.'
00274052:'I've gotta start saving money \nso I can go to the capital...<PAGE>Oh wait, I forgot \nI've gotta grow \nup first...'
00274053:'Some tournaments pit humans against other \nhumans, while others have humans squaring \noff against monster opponents.<PAGE>There are many monsters \nkept here at the coliseum \nfor that purpose.'
00274054:'Monsters can be brought within \nthe barrier if a special formula \nis applied to their bodies.<PAGE>Take a close look at the monsters \nin the coliseum and you'll see tattoos \netched into their hides.'
00274055:'Some nut job smashed the blastia \nthat keeps the monsters locked \nup. Who the hell would \ndo a thing like that?'
00274056:'They busted up all the reverse \nbarriers like nothing.<PAGE>That's not the kind of power \nyou take lightly...'
00274057:'This town's always enjoyed independence under Palestralle. \nThe guild has always made sure peace is maintained here.<PAGE>We'll be lucky if things don't get out \nof control with all these Knights around, \nbut I wouldn't hold your breath.'
00274058:'Palestralle's managed things \njust fine in Nordopolica \non its own until now.<PAGE>If the empire tries to force their \nway of doing things on the people \nhere, I'd get ready for fireworks.'
00274059:'Are those bloody Knights not gonna \nbe happy 'til they've taken \ntotal control of the city?<PAGE>They've got battleships on the water, \nand Knights all over the streets... \nWhat'll become of the coliseum?'
00274060:'If the coliseum falls into the hands \nof the empire, it's going to get real \nboring around here, real fast.<PAGE>This town'll get so tied up in rules and red \ntape, it's days'll be all but numbered.'
00274061:'The Knights and Palestralle were \nbutting heads over who'd handle \nsecurity around the coliseum.<PAGE>We ended up settling it over a game of \nrock, paper, scissors, I kid you not.'
00274062:'We ended up losing, so we had to give the \njob to the Knights. Man, playing rock, \npaper, scissors sure was fun, though...<PAGE>I know it's \njust a game, \nbut still...'
00274063:'There've been increasing problems between the Knights \nand the people since the armored heroes arrived, \nbut things are quieter here on the whole.<PAGE>That might only be because there are more \nwatchful eyes out there, though. '
00274064:'There's never been a time when the Knights \nhave been very welcome in Nordopolica.<PAGE>Still, at some point we'll have to \nadmit that certain things have improved \nsince they've been here.'
00274065:'It's not like all the Knights \nare bad eggs, as a rule.<PAGE>If you actually listen to them talk, quite a few \nof them aren't bad at all. Everybody's some mother's \nchild at one time or another, after all.'
00274066:'The Knights on the bottom aren't \nto blame, it's the nature of the \norganization that's the problem.'
00274067:'If you head in there, you'll find \nthe tournament registration desk.<PAGE>Wondering why I told you that? I could tell \nright off the bat you were here to sign up \nby those weapons you've got, that's why.'
00274068:'Money and prizes are all \nwell and good, but don't \nover-extend yourselves.<PAGE>The monsters you'll run \ninto here are nothing \nto shake a stick at.'
00274069:'On the other side of the mountains \noff to the west of here, there's \na desert oasis called Mantaic.<PAGE>If it truly is an oasis, it must \nhave a huge lake, like a shimmering \nblue jewel in a sea of sand.'
00274070:'It's got to be blazing hot though, and \nyou'd have to survive the treacherous \nmountain road that gets you there.'
00274071:'The town of Mantaic used to be a free \nland, meaning neither the empire nor \nthe guilds had any presence there.<PAGE>From what I heard though, this creep of \na magistrate they had for a while put \nit under the control of the Knights.'
00274072:'Now that the Knights are here \nas well, we're in the same boat \nas they are in Mantaic.<PAGE>I can't help feeling sorry for them.'
00274073:'Since the Knights have arrived \nBelius has died and the \nmonsters have gone crazy.<PAGE>Now one of their guys is hogging the champion \nspot in the tournaments. What next?'
00274074:'Ohh, I hope they'll be leaving \nsoon, the bullies.'
00274075:'I saw this gigantic \ninsect marching around \non the the ocean.<PAGE>Could I have been dreaming...? \nStill, it all \nseemed so real.'
00274076:'An insect... That's it. \nIt was a big beetle.<PAGE>A giant beetle walking on the ocean... \nWow... Just listen to me.'
00274077:'It's hard to tell when they're bundled \nup in all that metal, but they're barely \nmore than children, aren't they?<PAGE>Without the armor they look about \nthe same age as my boy who's gone \noff to train in Dahngrest.'
00274078:'Ohh, there I go thinking \nabout my son again.<PAGE>They've all got mothers like \nme I'm sure, just waiting for \ntheir boys to come home safe.'
00274079:'It must be ages since \nthey've had a good \nhome-cooked meal.<PAGE>I brought them some rice balls \nand miso soup, and they \nate up every last bite.'
00274080:'I'm glad they seemed \nto enjoy it so much.<PAGE>Maybe I'll bake them my \npeach cobbler, next.'

00274427:'I started thinking that being happy meant \ngetting to have whatever you want.'
00274428:'But that's not it at all...<PAGE>It's the moments you're working your \nhardest to get something you want. \nThat's where happiness is.'
00274429:'I'm trying to reason out what \nliving a good life involves.<PAGE>What do you think?'
00274430:'Living a good life, to me, is an end result.<PAGE>So then, how should we act in \norder to produce this result?'
00274431:'The one who laughs at 1Gald will \nend up crying about 1Gald. <PAGE>A small waste can \ncause big problems.'

00274548:'Intrinsically, darkness is the \nbreeding ground of evil. This is \nthe time we should be working. <PAGE>I don't know why, but it's \nprobably by tradition that \nless people work at night.'

00274697:'I still can't stand the heat during \nthe day, but I've gotten so I can \ntake the cold at night pretty well.<PAGE>If it's cold, you just add a couple of layers. This armor's \nfit to bust with all the long underwear I've got on in here.'
00274698:'Still, even if you become a \nmaster of desert living, it's \nhard to be happy out here.<PAGE>I'm bidding a fond farewell to this sand \ntrap as soon as I get the chance.'

00274923:'The number of products don't match. \nMaybe they're rolling around somewhere? \nCould you keep an eye out?'
00274924:'Thank you! \nDon't work so hard \nyou oversleep!'
00274925:'The Knights have continued \nworking into the night. \nI can't slack off. Welcome!'
00274926:'Thank you! \nSee you tomorrow!'
00274927:'Recently, small incidents \ndon't really rattle me. \nWatch how I am tonight!'
00274928:'Thank you! \nDream good dreams!'
00274929:'I don't think the water is \ngoing to stop at all. I've been \nworking like this all day... <PAGE>I'm starting to get tired. \nHey, trade places with me...'
00274930:'I'm totally wet \nfrom working all day... <PAGE>Water, women... \nYeah, I know what \nyou're thinking.'
00274931:'One day this water will \nrun out and we won't \nknow what to do... <PAGE>But we'll survive if \nwe work together. '
00274932:'You shouldn't be out \nand about with a \nwoman at this hour. <PAGE>Do you want me \nto tell <STR>(FRE)?'
00274933:'Are you all out \non night patrol? <PAGE>Be careful the Knights \ndon't catch you as they \nmake their rounds.'
00274934:'It is time for good \nchildren to be sleeping. <PAGE>Who is this bad \nadult that has \ntaken you out?'
00274935:'I remember swimming in \nthis fountain after coming \nback on a hot day the other time. <PAGE>That was quite nice.'
00274936:'I won't be swimming today \nbecause it’s not that hot.'
00274937:'I'm so worried \nI can't sleep. <PAGE>The monsters may come \nand attack if the \nbarrier is unstable.'
00274938:'There are other people that \nstayed behind too. I'm sure we'll \nendure if we all stick together. <PAGE>My girlfriend is still in the \ncapital. I cannot be weak.'
00274939:'When I think about a lower quarter\nwhere everyone can live safely, \nI just have to do something.'
00274940:'I want to get it back \nto what it was, before \nyou or <STR>(FRE) return.'
00274941:'I'm cooperating with \nthe monster warnings. <PAGE>It must be very hard on the Knights. \nI was hoping my contribution would \nalleviate some of that burden.'
00274942:'It's be awful if the Knights \nwere infested with people who \nwould do evil at any chance. <PAGE>Anyway, I can probably only \ntake over guard duties.'
00274943:'I heard <STR>(FRE) built a new \ntown, but I'm sure he'll come back \nto the lower quarter sometime. <PAGE>To be more accurate, \nhe'll return to the castle\nbecause he's a Knight. '
00274944:'<STR>(FRE) can't leave the lower quarter\nto fend for itself, either. \nHe's just like <STR>(YUR). '
00274945:'It seems that \nthe aque blastia went \ncompletely bust. '
00274946:'For now, I collected some of \nthe water that overflowed. <PAGE>I'm sure we can survive on that \nfor a while... But first off, \nwe need to stop the fountain.'
00274947:'I hear that Mordio escaped? <PAGE>I remember how big he was, but I \ndidn't get a look at his face \nbecause he was wearing a hood. '
00274948:'<STR>(YUR), I can't believe the \nImperial Knights arrested you \ninstead of chasing Mordio. <PAGE>Well, I guess with the stuff \nyou pull everyday, they do \nhave their reasons...'
00274949:'Don't wander outside \na lot at night. You're \na wanted person.'
00274950:'I won't be able to sleep for \nanother 3 hours because I \njust ate a piece of cake. <PAGE>Why can't I ever \nconquer temptation?'
00274951:'Are you going \nto the city? <PAGE>If you're going up, \nthere something that I \nneed to you to purchase. '
00274952:'You know that I have to \nclimb that steep hill to \ngo up? It's really steep.'
00274953:'What happened to <STR>(FRE)? \nHe always comes running \nin emergencies. '
00274954:'The only Knight I \ntrust is <STR>(FRE).'
00274955:'I'm praying to the skies. '
00274956:'I'm sure that my dead \nhusband is keeping an \neye on me from above.'
00274957:'We should ask the government \nto fix public blastia. <PAGE>Of course, I doubt they'd \never get around to fixing a \nblastia in the lower quarter. '
00274958:'You all wouldn't believe \nwhat the Empire does \nwith its finances. <PAGE>Do you have any idea how little \nof our hard-earned taxes actually \nmake it back to the lower quarter?'
00274959:'You know that the throne is \nvacant, right? But the country \ncontinues to operate. <PAGE>So the emperor is \njust symbolic.'
00274960:'The Empire is actually \nrun by the Imperial \nCouncil and Knights. <PAGE>The Council and the Knights \nhave about equal strength. '
00274961:'The knights will find a reason to \narrest anyone they don't like, \neven if you haven't done anything.<PAGE>It's not a good time to \ncome back here, <STR>(YUR).'
00274962:'I don't even \ntrust <STR>(FRE).<PAGE>They keep an eye on the \nlower quarter too. You \nshouldn't stick around.'
00274963:'A monopoly on blastia gives you power. <PAGE>For example, the barrier blastia. \nThis city would be annihilated in an \ninstant if they took that away.'
00274964:'The emperor can use \nthe blastia for absolute \ncontrol over the citizens. <PAGE>Isn't it dangerous to \ngive the emperor such \npowerful authority? '
00274965:'With the chaos in the Empire, it's \na good time to question whether the \nimperial family are worthy administrators. <PAGE>Any one not thinking hard about the \npolitical situation now has no \nright to be a citizen of the Empire. '
00274966:'What I'm trying to do is figure \nout if you're really qualified \nto be a citizen of the Empire<PAGE>...You're not really listening, \nare you? You're bored. It's \nwritten all over your face...'
00274967:'Halt! \nIf you go any further, \nyou'll leave the city. <PAGE>There are always more vicious \nmonsters on the prowl at night. It's \ndangerous for you equipped like that.'
00274968:'You cannot be allowed \nto leave the city with such \nlight equipment. <PAGE>Come back with the \nproper armaments \nduring the day.'
00274969:'An emergency order has been \nissued to seal off the capital. \nI cannot permit you to pass.'
00274970:'The gate is sealed. \nNo one may pass until \nthe order is lifted.<PAGE>It seems a little shady that \nyou want to leave at night. \nYou, you're not thinking...'
00274971:'Welcome to the Imperial \nCapital of Zaphias.'
00274972:'It's manual. <PAGE>Welcome to the Imperial \nCapital of Zaphias.'
00274973:'I'm worried about that strange \naurora surrounding the castle, \nbut I can't leave my post. <PAGE>What happened to the other knights? \nAre they defending the castle? \nNobody's telling me anything!'
00274974:'Regardless of the \nsituation, my duty is \nto guard this place. <PAGE>I'll carry out my duty \nuntil the end while wearing \nthe blue sword insignia.'
00274975:'Welcome to the Imperial \nCapital of Zaphias.'
00274976:'Welcome to the Imperial \nCapital of Zaphiaaah......\n... I'm sleepy'
00274977:'I can't lose my \nconcentration especially, \nwhen guarding at night. '
00274978:'When something like \nthat happens, I am so \nthankful for the barrier. <PAGE>I have now realized its value \nfor a good night sleep. '
00274979:'The Knights promise tranquil \nnights in the capital that \nnever change, no matter what.'
00274980:'Sleep soundly.'
00274981:'Welcome to Art Paradise! <PAGE>Your eternal smile copied \nonto the canvas invites me \nto an Eden of ecstasy.'
00274982:'Fate has brought before \nme, with the heavenly brush, \nthis amazing subject. <PAGE>Will you be my model? \nLet's create Eden together.'
00274983:'............<PAGE>Do you think it's strange? \nThere are nights that I \nget sentimental too.'
00274984:'The monsters dwell at night. \nDarkness covers sky, and eats \naway at the hearts of the people. <PAGE>I draw the people's momentary \nsadness. I am the stained glass \nof the people's heart.  '
00274985:'What? \nMy wanted posted doesn't \nlook like you? <PAGE>Whether the resemblance is \nthere or not is nonsense! \nThat drawing is a work of art.'
00274986:'Ahh, a drawing from the back? \nThis is my lukewarm kindness to \npeople who do not understand art. <PAGE>Sometimes even scribbling is \nnecessary to earn money for food.'
00274987:'I'm waiting for \nthe dragon to come. <PAGE>I watch and wait every night... \nOh, my magificent dragon...'
00274988:'I've been awake all night... I'm so...<PAGE>No! How could I do this if I \nwere asleep? I will keep going \nuntil I draw the dragon...'
00274989:'That's how it was. \nOr was it this way? <PAGE>It's not like this. \nThat phoenix was \nmore like...'
00274990:'Don't interfere! Don't \nblame me if I burn you with \nmy burning artistic heart! <PAGE>Heh heh heh... ♪ Fire!'
00274991:'The present capital\nis very interesting! <PAGE>Some people are frightened, \nothers struggle to escape... They all \nhave quite unusual expressions.'
00274992:'Do you think that's a little \nshameless? But it's my duty as an \nartist to draw people's expression. <PAGE>There's more value in drawing \nthese real expressions than \nmaking up smiling faces.'
00274993:'Next, I'd like to draw \nthe two young candidates \nto the emperor's throne.'
00274994:'I heard the two candidates \nare allowed to walk around \noutside without a bodyguards!<PAGE>I would like to express \ntheir fearless and bold \ncountenances on canvas!'

00275019:'I know that you're \nhappy, but you don't have \nto come and show off...'
00275020:'I'm <STR>(FRE) Defense \nForce member 006.♪ <PAGE>Don't tell him. \nIt's a secret.'
00275021:'You'll become bored \nof eventless days. <PAGE>Life has to have \nsome excitement!'
00275022:'Don't you feel \nempty staring at us?'
00275023:'Poor thing. '
00275024:'...Are you boasting?'
00275025:'Aren't you trying too \nhard? Aren't you part of the \nwrong social standing? <PAGE>It's not about the \nnumbers. It's about the \ndepth of your love.'
00275026:'My girl friend is acting strange. \nShe says she has other plans and \nwon't go out on a date with me. '
00275027:'My girl friend is sitting \nright beside me, and she \nwon't even look my way. <PAGE>What's going on, \nall of a sudden?'
00275028:'The previous emperor, Krunos \nXIV, passed away due to an \nillness that was going around.'
00275029:'Although the Emperor is determined \nhereditarily, Krunos XIV didn't \nhave a direct successor. <PAGE>That's why the selection \nof the next Emperor has \nbeen a lingering issue. '
00275030:'The wind at night is chilly. '
00275031:'Longjohns are essential \nwhen going out at night. '
00275032:'The taxes rose again. \nThe taxes in Zaphias\nare too high. '
00275033:'The Council gets to do \nwhat they want in the \nabsence of the emperor. <PAGE>I'd like to see \nthe emperor take \nover the throne.'
00275034:'Zaphias holds so many memories \nfor me. The house that I inherited \nfrom my parents is here, too. <PAGE>It may be dangerous, but I \ndon't really want to leave.'
00275035:'I am prepared to \nbe buried here. '
00275036:'What's up with the Knights recently? <PAGE>I heard they seized the castle, \nsplit into two groups and are \nnow fighting each other. '
00275037:'Isn't it the job \nof the Knights to \nguard Zaphias? <PAGE>How can they fight each \nother and just ignore \nthe capital completely?!'
00275038:'The monster is \nwrithing in the sky...'
00275039:'I can't sleep wondering \nwhen that monster will \ncome crashing down.'
00275040:'That monster up there... \nDid it always live there \nin the sky? <PAGE>So we've been \nliving under that \nmonster all this time.'
00275041:'That's scary!'
00275042:'I lived in another city \nbefore coming to Zaphias. <PAGE>I've been living away \nfrom other Krityans \nfor a while now.'
00275043:'Nighttime is when \nI'm really glad that \nwe have blastia. <PAGE>I mean, I couldn't sleep \nat night without a barrier \nblastia. I'd be so worried...'
00275044:'Hey you were running around \nwith some guys in armor earlier! <PAGE>That looked like fun! \nWhat kind of game was it?'
00275045:'I wanna play that \nchase game too!'
00275046:'Hey! You're that \nwanted guy!<PAGE>I would help keep the \ncapital safe if I caught \na wanted man...<PAGE>For now, I need to start \nwith meeting more \npeople in the capital. <PAGE>Now I know the lower quarter\nand the people who live here.'
00275047:'You look kind of like \nthat guy on the wanted \nposters, but...not... <PAGE>It'd be bad if they were \nreally false charges. <PAGE>People talk, you know, \nand it's good information \na lot of the time. <PAGE>It's a good idea to \nlisten to what people \nlike me have to say.'
00275048:'The Knight standing in front \nof the gate now is different \nfrom the usual Knight. <PAGE>He's got a bad \nreputation because he's \nalways slacking off.'
00275049:'I want to guard \nthe gate instead. '
00275050:'I thought the blastia was \nsecure, but I guess not...'
00275051:'There is something \nstrange going on with aer \nwith this much disarray...'
00275052:'I decided to guard the \ncapital and its citizens. <PAGE>The area around the barrier \nhas calmed down, but that \ndoesn't mean nothing will happen.'
00275053:'Should we really \nrebuild the town now? <PAGE>Everyone evacuated the \nlower quarter. We don't \nhave enough people. '
00275054:'Can we count on \nthe Knights or not?'
00275055:'There are all kinds of Knights. Some \nwho would give their lives to fight, \nand some who just run away. <PAGE>It's nice that people are \ndifferent, but can an organization \nreally function like that?'
00275056:'It's been a while since \nI battled monsters. I remember \nhow I used to feel. <PAGE>I guess this is what \nI'm cut out to do.'
00275057:'Maybe I'll join \nthe Knights. <PAGE>I should infuse some energy \ninto those wimps and rebuild \nthem from the inside.'
00275058:'I ran out of sugar when \nI was making dinner. '
00275059:'You live in the lower \nquarter, right? <PAGE>Why don't you come over \nfor dinner sometime?'
00275060:'The lower quarter is \nhaving water issues. <PAGE>I can't make dinner \nwithout water.'
00275061:'Did you eat dinner \nalready? If not, how \nabout eating at my place?'
00275062:'Oh my! You're \nthe one the Knights \nwere chasing! <PAGE>Do you really think it's \na good idea to be here?'
00275063:'Hey, were you \nplaying tag with \nthe Knights?'
00275064:'There's a meeting for \nthe <STR>(FRE) Defense Force. \nI have to hurry. '
00275065:'I'm late because \nI was preparing dinner \nfor my family. <PAGE>I should have each person \njust buy whatever on \ntheir own from now on.'
00275066:'The imperial family monopolized blastia \nand got hooked on money and power. \nThat's why Zaphias wound up like this.'
00275067:'Isn't it about time that \nthe citizens rebel against \nthe imperial family?'
00275068:'What's going to happen \nto the Empire?'
00275069:'We have our share of \nuncertainty in our ranks. But \nwe must protect the capital. <PAGE>That is our solemn \nduty as Knights.'
00275070:'We're all gonna end up \ngetting eaten by monsters, \nanyway. I'm going to bed!'
00275071:'This 'round the clock guard \nduty can't go on forever. \nOur bodies'll apart.<PAGE>You either die now, or you die \nlater. That's the only difference. \nFighting is such a waste of time.'
00275072:'Inns are always busiest at night. \n<STR>(YUR), you of all people \nshould know that! <PAGE>If you're not gonna help \npeople outside, go clean up \nthe bottles from that table.'
00275073:'<STR>(YUR), if you're gonna rest, \njust go on to your own room. <PAGE>I'll get a room ready for \nyour lady friend, too.'
00275074:'Did you feed \n<STR>(RAP)? <PAGE>If not, I have \nsome leftovers \nyou can give him.'
00275075:'What do you want \nfor dinner, <STR>(YUR)? \nI'll cook whatever you like.'
00275076:'Your room's \nready for you, \nso you can go on up.<PAGE>Relax, nobody's gone in your room, \n<STR>(YUR).  Of course, that means \nit hasn't been cleaned, either.'
00275077:'You came all the \nway back here. Why don't \nyou take a break?'
00275078:'<STR>(YUR), just take your time \nand do what you need to do.'
00275079:'Ted's sick, \nso he's resting \nnow. <PAGE>I swear, that child. \nI told him not to go out, \nbut did he listen? No...'
00275080:'If this weirdness keeps up, \nI don't think we'll be able to \nkeep living in the capital. <PAGE>I'll hold on for a \nlittle longer, though.'
00275081:'Welcome back, <STR>(YUR). \nYou sure are working hard.'
00275082:'You make sure you rest \nproperly, now. Go on. \nEveryone already went up!'
00275083:'I don't care if the barrier \ngoes down or monsters attack. \nI will protect this home. <PAGE>So don't you worry \nabout us back here, <STR>(YUR).'
00275084:'I'll be sure you have \na home waiting for you \nwhen you get back.'
00275085:'You know, <STR>(YUR), you and <STR>(FRE)\nstarted out with different purposes, \nbut now you're working together. <PAGE>It's kinda nice to see you \ntwo working together again.'
00275086:'I'm sure we'll be all right with you \nand <STR>(FRE) working together. Show \nthem what you're made of, <STR>(YUR)!'
00275087:'<STR>(YUR), you're still \nhanging around here?<PAGE>The old lady's gonna kick \nyour butt if you don't \ndo what you gotta do.'
00275088:'Owww...\nThe old lady should lighten up...<PAGE>I was just sitting out back for \na little bit. Okay, so \nmaybe I had a drink... '
00275089:'Hey, if you have some \ntime, could you go get \nsome water for me?'
00275090:'You know what? \nThe old lady is \nso nice to you. <PAGE>I mean, even if she yells at you, \nshe never kicks your butt. \nIt's, like, everyday for me.'
00275091:'You're gonna stay \nhere tonight, right? <PAGE>Let's have a drink after \nI finish my work.'
00275092:'Tell me about your travels. \nMan, I'm finally gonna get \nto have a fun night. <PAGE>...If the old lady doesn't \ncome barging in, that is.'
00275093:'It looks like they set up a \n"<STR>(FRE) Defense Force" \nin the citizen quarter. <PAGE>I hear Ted got \ninterested and started \noffering them information.'
00275094:'So, hey, where's the \n<STR>(YUR) Defense Force?'
00275095:'The guy that used to work \nfor us left the capital, too. <PAGE>Now I gotta find someone \nelse to do the work.'
00275096:'Oh well. Business is pretty \ndead, now, so I don't need \nanyone right away. <PAGE>I'm actually more \nworried about getting \ncustomers than workers.'
00275097:'Hey, <STR>(YUR). It's been a \nwhile since you first \nleft on your trip. <PAGE>Heh, I think trip has actually \ndone you a little good.'
00275098:'You know, <STR>(YUR), those \nladies you're traveling with \nlook pretty strong. <PAGE>Come on, honestly. They wear the \npants, right? No matter how strong \nmen are, we're suckers for women.'
00275099:'Don't worry, <STR>(YUR). \nEven if you all aren't around, we'll \nprotect the lower quarter.'
00275100:'Yeah, we'll be all \nright. We'll just \ndo what we can.'
00275101:'Man, this world \nis in bad shape. <PAGE>I guess you're up to \nyour necks in it, \nyourselves, huh, <STR>(YUR).'
00275102:'Well, I'm not too worried if \nyou all are taking care of stuff. <PAGE>All of us will just be \nhere waiting for you and \n<STR>(FRE) to come home.'
00275103:'Heeeey there pretty lady! \nHow about you and me crack open a \nbottle or ten and have us a night? <PAGE>...Hey, you're a guy?!'
00275104:'Come on. A guy sitting \nnext to me ain't helping \nmy chances. Beat it.'
00275105:'Hey! \nI heard about you! <PAGE>You got caught by the \nknights, right? \nI can't believe you're out.'
00275106:'So let me guess. \nThey gave you stew, right? <PAGE>Choke down some stew, then puke \nit back up for the next guy, right? \nHah hah hah hah!'
00275107:'Those two at that table over \nthere are always talking about \nserious stuff over their drinks. <PAGE>Come on, guys! Drinking's \nsupposed to be fun!'
00275108:'You can still have fun \n*hic* drinking alone, \nright?<PAGE>Shut up nobody's talkin' \nto you go away stop \nbotherin' me... *hic*'
00275109:'Sometimes a man \njust can't go home...'
00275110:'I'm waitin' for all the \nhullabaloo to calm down. <PAGE>So don't go thinking I got \nkicked out. It's not that. \nNope.'
00275111:'The largest mercenary guild\nis the Blood Alliance. <PAGE>They can be a little rough, \nbut they get the job done.'
