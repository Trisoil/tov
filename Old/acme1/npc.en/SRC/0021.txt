## POINTER 2100
Ahh, the skies are finally clearing 
up. My sheets can be dried... <PAGE>What? My bed smells 
of mold?! That's just 
the way it goes.

## POINTER 2101
How many days has it been since 
we've had these blue skies? <PAGE>Ahh... 
It's warm...

## POINTER 2102
This inn is full of history. His 
Majesty the Emperor himself has 
stayed here! Please have a stay.

## POINTER 2103
There are so many comings 
and goings in town lately, we 
often have no vacancies.<PAGE>I wonder if this has anything 
to do with some man they 
call the Don dying in Dahngrest?

## POINTER 2104
Right this way, travelers. 
We still have vacancies. 
Please have a stay.

## POINTER 2105
The refugees from Zaphias only managed to 
escape with the clothes on their backs, so 
they don't have enough money to stay here.<PAGE>It's a shame. I was hoping the refugees 
would drum up some business...

## POINTER 2106
Ah, hello, traveler. How about spending 
a night with us? Both land and sea routes 
are very dangerous right now, you know.

## POINTER 2107
I thought we'd always be safe 
inside our barriers...<PAGE>...But when you hear about how the 
barrier in Zaphias failed...

## POINTER 2108
Hello, traveler. I don't know where 
you're headed, but I do know a night 
spent here would do you some good.

## POINTER 2109
Nothing but trouble, from one 
end of the world to the other!<PAGE>A number of people evacuated to 
Hypionia by boat, but I imagine 
things are the same everywhere.

## POINTER 2110
Where are you off to? There's 
no need to be so hasty. Why 
not have a nice rest here?

## POINTER 2111
This is it...I'm 
prepared.<PAGE>The world's going to end no matter what we 
do. Everyone's going to die together. That 
means there's nothing left to be afraid of.

## POINTER 2112
Oh, Rhybgaros? They 
like dark places. <PAGE>That's why they only come 
out on rainy days.

## POINTER 2113
Gathering under trees for shade...? 
Yeah, you could probably find 
Rhybgaros doing that.

## POINTER 2114
A yellow Rhybgaro! The horns 
of those with yellow skin 
are more expensive! <PAGE>I think the yellow 
ones that I saw are 
more expensive.

## POINTER 2115
I'm scared. They're 
yellow monsters. I'm 
scare of Rhybgaros.

## POINTER 2116
Welcome to the Port of Capua. 
Capua is divided into Nor to 
the south and Torim to the north. <PAGE>This is the south side, 
Capua Nor.

## POINTER 2117
Nor and Torim are 
both very spirited 
towns... <PAGE>However, due to 
the magistrate...

## POINTER 2118
My friend never comes to see me 
any more...ever since she went 
to work at Lord Ragou's manor.<PAGE>Something must have 
happened...something 
she can't tell me about.

## POINTER 2119
I was told to go work at Lord 
Ragou's manor, too, but...<PAGE>...I don't want to go. It frightens me...

## POINTER 2120
My friend who worked at Lord 
Ragou's manor finally told 
me what she saw there... <PAGE>They blindfolded people who couldn't pay 
their taxes, put them in cages, and...*ulp*! 
I-I really don't want to talk about it...

## POINTER 2121
Ragou...he was absolute 
scum...I'm so glad 
he disappeared...<PAGE>I'll never call him 
"Lord Ragou" again.

## POINTER 2122
Ragou made all our 
lives difficult.<PAGE>The people living such sumptuous lifestyles 
in Zaphias...I think they should have 
to get a taste of what we went through.

## POINTER 2123
Does that make me a horrible 
person? No...I can think 
whatever I want.<PAGE>Ah...were you listening 
to me...?

## POINTER 2124
They say the barrier in Zaphias 
was fixed, and some of the 
citizens have come back.<PAGE>I wish it had just 
stayed broken...

## POINTER 2125
I thought it would serve the 
people in Zaphias right to 
go through a little pain...

## POINTER 2126
This scary change in my personality is 
all Ragou's fault. All I can think about 
lately are terrible, terrible things.<PAGE>It's not just me. Everyone in town is 
the same. We're all carrying around 
a blackness in our hearts nowadays...

## POINTER 2127
It's all Ragou's fault...<PAGE>...But no. The worst thing 
you can do is try to pin 
blame on someone else...

## POINTER 2128
The strange thing in 
the sky, and that giant 
tower are nothing.<PAGE>At least, nothing compared 
to Ragou's tyranny.

## POINTER 2129
Ragou's oppression was 
absolutely monstrous.<PAGE>Now all anyone can talk about 
is monsters. Have they forgotten 
what happened here?

## POINTER 2130
That was an enormous thud. 
But I'm not surprised by 
something like this. <PAGE>Nothing gets done 
by being worried.

## POINTER 2131
I'd like to thank Ragou for 
providing me the courage 
to withstand anything. <PAGE>Luckily, he isn't 
around to accept 
my gratitude.

## POINTER 2132
Rhybgaro horns are a vital 
source of ki...ki...uh, a 
really important medicine.<PAGE>...That's what the woman doctor 
in glasses with the white wolf 
puppy was saying, anyway.

## POINTER 2133
You know the Rhybgaro that 
old official guy was talking 
about? I know where it is.<PAGE>It's in the forest to the 
south. I'm not lying!

## POINTER 2134
What, Rhybgaro? You're 
looking for ways to get 
out of paying taxes, too? <PAGE>I have no idea... 
That's your problem.

## POINTER 2135
You're really relentless. 
Go to the uplands 
south of the city. <PAGE>It may be fun being 
killed by the monsters.

## POINTER 2136
No matter how good distribution is and 
how many products are on the market, 
there's nothing better than gels.<PAGE>You're tired? Have a gel. 
Hungry? Have a gel. These 
things are the bee's knees!

## POINTER 2137
I do wish they made flavors like tofu 
and cod roe, though. How much more 
fulfilling my gel life would be then!

## POINTER 2138
There was a lot of commotion 
from the alley. I wonder 
what was going on. <PAGE>Oh! Forget it! It's nothing really. 
I was just a little curious.

## POINTER 2139
I'm just happy with gels. <PAGE>I don't care if a cat is crying 
in the alley or if an assassin 
is carrying out his secret plot♪

## POINTER 2140
When we were struggling under 
Ragou's yoke and didn't have anything 
to eat, gels saved my life...<PAGE>Thank you, gels! I 
love you, gels! We'll 
be friends forever.

## POINTER 2141
That was the reason I became such 
a big gel aficionado, you know.

## POINTER 2142
First Belius from Nordopolica...now 
the Don from Dahngrest...?<PAGE>What's going to happen to our world? 
More importantly, what's going to 
happen to our world's gels?

## POINTER 2143
Gels really are like 
an oasis in my heart...no, 
in my body!

## POINTER 2144
Hey, this is serious! I heard 
Zaphias is in shambles!<PAGE>Zaphias manufactures 
most of the gels!

## POINTER 2145
Does this mean I won't 
be able to keep on eating 
my gels...?

## POINTER 2146
The shops are still stocked with gels, 
but who knows when supplies are going to run 
out? It really keeps me up at night...<PAGE>I just can't think about 
anything else right now.

## POINTER 2147
Maybe I should buy up all the 
gels left before someone else 
gets their hands on them...

## POINTER 2148
People are saying that thing 
in the sky is going to destroy 
the entire world.<PAGE>That's ridiculous! Let's 
cut it up and eat it!

## POINTER 2149
Doesn't the texture of that thing 
in the sky seem so...gel-like?

## POINTER 2150
What is that tower? <PAGE>I'm scared, really scared...

## POINTER 2151
This may not be the 
time to be calmly 
eating gel.

## POINTER 2152
My husband got mad at me, saying 
this was no time for gels and 
I was too old for them anyway.<PAGE>The shopkeepers won't sell 
them to me anymore, either.

## POINTER 2153
Hmph! I don't really care. 
Bottles are the new 
big thing, anyway.<PAGE>Aren't holy bottles 
just the best?♪

## POINTER 2154
Someone went into 
the alley over there 
just right now. <PAGE>It's dangerous entering a dark 
place on a rainy day like this.

## POINTER 2155
I can't say public safety 
is good here. <PAGE>I don't think you should go into 
any back alleys in this city.

## POINTER 2156
What were you doing 
in the back alley? <PAGE>Are you some 
common criminal?

## POINTER 2157
You... you don't look 
like someone who 
does bad things.

## POINTER 2158
When the sky clears 
up like this, my heart 
becomes heavy. <PAGE>Even without the weather, the 
atmosphere has changed and 
it's harder to live in this city...

## POINTER 2159
...
......
.........<PAGE>What about photosynthesis...? 
I don't know when it's going 
to clear up next.

## POINTER 2160
When I was a younger 
man, we didn't have 
a magistrate here.<PAGE>I'm trying to remember when 
it was that the Empire's 
administration got so strict...

## POINTER 2161
I don't care how nice the new 
magistrate is. We're not 
as free as we used to be.

## POINTER 2162
I heard Don 
Whitehorse 
passed on.<PAGE>Did you know I took care of him 
once, when he was just a little 
whippersnapper? It's true.

## POINTER 2163
The Don was sent to his relatives' 
house here in town for a while 
when he was only five.<PAGE>I was eighteen...it's funny to think 
that there was a time when I 
could lord it over the Don...

## POINTER 2164
You know, it might be easier living 
in another town. I've thought 
about it many times, but...<PAGE>Up and moving at this age...I 
don't know if my old 
bones could take it.

## POINTER 2165
All the old friends I had here are 
already dead. I wouldn't have 
any regrets leaving this town.<PAGE>Actually...I don't think I have 
any regrets left at all...

## POINTER 2166
There was a town called Duo that sank 
into the sea before I was even born. 
It was between Torim and Nor.<PAGE>I certainly never thought I'd get 
to see it rise up out of the ocean. 
Live and learn, they say...

## POINTER 2167
What now? You say the thing that rose 
up from the sea isn't Duo at all?<PAGE>What is it, then?

## POINTER 2168
The sky has split...so 
many curious things 
happening lately.<PAGE>Live and learn.

## POINTER 2169
*Sigh*... "Live and learn", indeed...

## POINTER 2170
How shocking! A gigantic tower 
suddenly shooting up from 
out of the mountains?<PAGE>This is the true definition 
of "live and learn"!

## POINTER 2171
I wonder what will 
happen next?<PAGE>Whatever it is, I'm looking forward to it.♪

## POINTER 2172
When I came to this city, 
we had clear skies 
for half a month. <PAGE>You have to 
travel under 
blue skies.

## POINTER 2173
I look out over the dull 
ocean from the window 
of the inn every day. <PAGE>I've been traveling under 
such discouraging skies 
for the past half month.

## POINTER 2174
The magistrate named Ragou? Absolutely 
disgraceful. He's brought nothing 
but shame to the Empire.

## POINTER 2175
There aren't many peas in the pod as rotten 
as Ragou was. I'm certain the next 
magistrate will be much more agreeable.

## POINTER 2176
The death of the Don 
will mean the weakening 
of the Guild Union.<PAGE>Now the Empire, and this town, 
will be in peace and security.

## POINTER 2177
I think this is the ideal 
time to retake Capua 
Torim by force.<PAGE>However, neither the Council nor the 
Knights seem to have much interest.

## POINTER 2178
Alexei was known as a proud and honorable 
knight, but in the end he turned out to be 
nothing more than a low-born blackguard.<PAGE>He simply wasn't 
fit to lead.

## POINTER 2179
I would be so pleased if the 
high-born, noble Captain Cumore 
would return to this town.

## POINTER 2180
That young knight named <STR>(FRE) can 
certainly handle himself, can't he?<PAGE>He may not be of high birth, but it's 
hard to find any other fault with him.

## POINTER 2181
Of course, <STR>(FRE) can't hold 
a candle to Captain Cumore.<PAGE>I am quite sure he's the 
strongest knight of all.

## POINTER 2182
Whenever will the new 
Emperor be appointed?<PAGE>If only a successor could 
be decided, it would surely 
help to quell this chaos.

## POINTER 2183
I would be quite happy with His Royal 
Highness Ioder, or even someone else. 
We need a new Emperor soon...

## POINTER 2184
I was surprised with that 
tower, but it's okay. <PAGE>That's because we 
have a barrier.

## POINTER 2185
As long as we have 
the Empire and barriers, 
this world is secure. <PAGE>I feel sorry for lower 
class citizens who do not 
believe in the Empire.

## POINTER 2186
Things seem to be quite clamorous 
outside town, but within the barrier, 
it's rather peaceful.<PAGE>Of course, the low-born folk are 
panicking, as is their wont.

## POINTER 2187
We have a barrier. No 
matter what happens, 
we will be safe.

## POINTER 2188
Rhybgaros are monsters, 
aren't they? The monster 
may have been pregnant. <PAGE>Recently, Rhybgaros come out 
to breed when it rains.

## POINTER 2189
On rainy days, Rhybgaros are 
wandering outside the barriers. <PAGE>They seem to 
appear in wooded 
areas.

## POINTER 2190
What a magnificent 
view.<PAGE>Looking upon such a sight, 
one forgets all their bothersome, 
daily cares.

## POINTER 2191
I wonder what lies beyond the sea?

## POINTER 2192
They're Rhybgaros? 
What's that? Is 
that some candy? <PAGE>I don't what to talk about 
things that aren't fun.

## POINTER 2193
Rhybgaro, Rhybgaro... I don't 
know what that is but there's 
a sweet ring to that name...

## POINTER 2194
What a magnificent view.<PAGE>Looking upon such a sight, 
one forgets all their bothersome, 
daily cares.

## POINTER 2195
The warm sun, blue ocean, and 
white rippling waves... <PAGE>That's right, they're 
all mine!

## POINTER 2196
A new magistrate 
has been appointed? 
I couldn't care less.<PAGE>It has nothing whatsoever 
to do with me.

## POINTER 2197
Being able to live gazing at the 
sea all day is pure bliss.

## POINTER 2198
Isn't it hot today? I'd say it's two...no, 
three times as hot as it usually is.<PAGE>Ahh...how I'd love to go for 
a swim in the ocean...

## POINTER 2199
Do I still have a bathing suit...? 
Ah, but my arms aren't 
in such great shape...
