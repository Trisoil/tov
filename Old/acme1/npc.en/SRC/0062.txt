## POINTER 6200
There are times, during the day, when 
I wish the temperature would just drop 
already... But this is a bit too much.<PAGE>It's s-so c-c-cold... I'm 
gonna freeze to death...

## POINTER 6201
A while back, I got the wise idea 
of touching my armor with my bare 
hand, and my finger got stuck.<PAGE>What in the hell is the temperature right now, anyway...?

## POINTER 6202
I still can't stand the heat during 
the day, but I've gotten so I can 
take the cold at night pretty well.<PAGE>If it's cold, you just add a couple of layers. This armor's 
fit to bust with all the long underwear I've got on in here.

## POINTER 6203
Still, even if you become a 
master of desert living, it's 
hard to be happy out here.<PAGE>I'm bidding a fond farewell to this sand 
trap as soon as I get the chance.

## POINTER 6204
I've been with the Knights for a year, my birthplace 
is the imperial capital, and the other day, 
I was assigned to the <STR>(FRE) Brigade!<PAGE>My hobby is cooking, my talent is interpretive 
sword dancing, and my favorite 
color is mulberry! I'm single!

## POINTER 6205
This has been my self-introduction! 
Please forgive me 
for being so late!<PAGE>I'd be pleased to answer any questions you 
might have! The Captain has instructed 
us all to comply with you in every way!

## POINTER 6206
This region is a bit of a no-man's land, 
so it rarely sees any visitors.<PAGE>I wonder...what sort of shape 
the other towns are in.

## POINTER 6207
Completing our duties in the desert is hard 
enough, but what's worse, we have a hard 
time getting information out here.<PAGE>Thanks to the heat, the Knights stationed 
here have no sense of urgency or motivation. 
Even my morale is beginning to waver...

## POINTER 6208
The guards work in shifts, but really, 
what's there to guard here? We've got 
nothing to do when we're off-duty.<PAGE>There was way more to keep me busy 
when it was my watch. Whoa, I'm more 
hard-working than I realized.

## POINTER 6209
The results of our investigation aren't very promising. The historical 
analysis is moving right along, but we're coming up dry when 
it comes to anything having to do with the Commandant.<PAGE>It may be more trouble than 
its worth trying to find 
any clues in these ruins.

## POINTER 6210
We've been forgotten. That's it, he's forgotten 
us. Our Captain's gone and totally forgotten 
that he left us here on guard duty!

## POINTER 6211
Captain <STR>(FRE) does skip a beat 
sometimes with things that 
don't hold his interest.<PAGE>Do me a favor, and let the good Captain 
know he's still got us out in the desert 
on guard detail when you see him next.

## POINTER 6212
The heat makes running our investigation 
difficult during the day, so we're 
carrying on with it at night, too.<PAGE>Night isn't really the best time 
to dig things up 'cause you can't 
see what you're doing. Oh well.

## POINTER 6213
And man, I had no idea it would 
be this cold at night... We're 
gonna have to ask for a raise.

## POINTER 6214
Whoa! Watch where 
you're stepping!<PAGE>It's dark, so take care where you walk. We can't 
have you crunching some priceless artifact 
underfoot simply 'cause you didn't see it.

## POINTER 6215
A monster in the sky? Yeah, 
I guess it does look like something's 
up there. I know.<PAGE>It's the job of the Knights to clean up monsters. 
It's what they're there for, aint' it? All we're 
worried about is getting on with the excavation.

## POINTER 6216
Unfortunately, the investigation hasn't 
progressed to the point where we can 
commit to a theory of what occurred.<PAGE>We must press on if we hope to 
complete the task the Knights originally 
hired us to perform...

## POINTER 6217
What use would anyone have in coming to these ruins...? 
There are no blastia buried here. What value could 
a pile of rubble such as this possibly have?<PAGE>Hmm, it just doesn't 
add up.

## POINTER 6218
We've uncovered an artifact of 
tremendous historical importance. 
We've discovered writing!<PAGE>This gives us unmistakable clues 
about the civilization of 
those who once lived here!

## POINTER 6219
...The flowers...to the north...mountain... 
Hmm, does this next 
part say "picnic?"<PAGE>A mountain to the north must mean Mt. 
Temza. But why is the word "picnic" 
carved into something like this?

## POINTER 6220
Hasn't the fountain blastia 
been repaired yet? <PAGE>We're downhill from 
the fountain here, 
so I'm worried about flooding.

## POINTER 6221
There's nothing to worry about. 
We Knights will repel the monsters 
whenever the blastia disappears.

## POINTER 6222
I am so excited! <PAGE>When a plan comes 
together, my fears go 
flyin' out the window.

## POINTER 6223
You came all the way from 
the Tolbyccian continent and 
you're sure you're all right?<PAGE>I see. 
Guess I've still got a lot 
to learn about travel.

## POINTER 6224
We Knights will 
guard Zaphias. <PAGE>Rest well. 
You are safe.

## POINTER 6225
<STR>(FRE) will keep 
the Knights together. <PAGE>He may be young, but 
I was watching him work. 
He's perfect for the job.

## POINTER 6226
Commandant Alexei, 
Captain Schwann, 
Captain Cumore...<PAGE>They all left the Knights. 
<STR>(FRE)'s the only one left.

## POINTER 6227
When I was a kid, I 
dreamed of joining a 
mercenary guild. <PAGE>Wow, that really 
takes me back...

## POINTER 6228
The most familiar 
guild here has got to 
be Fortune's Market. <PAGE>They even have shops 
here in the capital.

## POINTER 6229
People from the 
lower quarter are 
all good people. <PAGE>I have to work hard 
for the citizens.

## POINTER 6230
These citizens took 
over as guards. 
I'm really thankful.

## POINTER 6231
The authority of the imperial 
family has collapsed. 
Serves them right.

## POINTER 6232
Okay, who's going 
to bring peace to 
this chaos? <PAGE>It probably won't be 
the imperial family.

## POINTER 6233
I still don't know about going 
outside the barrier, though. 
It's pretty scary...

## POINTER 6234
If you listen to that guy, 
you'll want to just head 
straight out on your trip.

## POINTER 6235
It's my first trip, so the 
stronger people I can 
travel with, the better. <PAGE>I figure I should hire 
a few mercenaries 
just to be safe.

## POINTER 6236
I wonder what mercenary 
guild would be good 
for my job. <PAGE>Do you know 
any good guilds?

## POINTER 6237
Getting ready is the 
best part of traveling. <PAGE>I haven't gone traveling with 
a group in a long time. 
I can't wait to do it again.

## POINTER 6238
Wow, this city is 
really wonderful... <PAGE>It'd be better without 
people making all that 
ruckus at night, though.

## POINTER 6239
Although the life of the 
flower is short, it still 
blooms with all its energy. <PAGE>I really like to 
watch these flowers.

## POINTER 6240
Regardless of how anxious I feel, 
I forget all my troubles when I 
look at the beautiful blossoms. <PAGE>I don't know if that's 
good or bad...

## POINTER 6241
We're all going to die 
anyway. We'd all be 
happier as friends.

## POINTER 6242
We can watch the blossoms again. 
Watching the night in Halure and 
drinking under the blossoms...

## POINTER 6243
But, the barrier is the reason we 
can lose ourselves in our thoughts 
in the silence of the night.

## POINTER 6244
People must use the night to rest, 
but the Tree of Halure goes on, 
tirelessly protecting our town.

## POINTER 6245
We have to study more 
to understand the 
importance of the Tree...

## POINTER 6246
Just like darkness envelopes all, 
this Tree envelopes the city.  <PAGE>Thankfully, we're able 
to sleep soundly.

## POINTER 6247
Going on a trip...
Yeah, I guess that's 
too much to ask...<PAGE>But I would like to see 
Aspio at least once.

## POINTER 6248
If you follow the 
hill up, you'll arrive 
at the Tree of Halure. <PAGE>It has been restored 
to beautiful life!

## POINTER 6249
Flowers at night 
are so elegant.

## POINTER 6250
The sun has set, but it will rise 
again in the morning. Flowers may 
fall, but they will bloom again.

## POINTER 6251
This is the law of nature.

## POINTER 6252
I was told to stay late and 
finish my work for the day. 
That's why I can't sleep.

## POINTER 6253
But I really don't 
have anything that 
I need to do.

## POINTER 6254
We're all going to die...

## POINTER 6255
I don't like it here 
because the nights 
are dark and cold.

## POINTER 6256
The night...<PAGE>The night really makes 
you thankful for the sun.

## POINTER 6257
A monster may dwell in 
the Tree of Halure. <PAGE>In an ever changing world, 
flower viewing remains the same. 
Many that come here just for that.

## POINTER 6258
The charm of the Tree of 
Halure is so powerful you could 
almost call it a monster.

## POINTER 6259
It's been a while 
since humans have 
come to Myorzo. <PAGE>You can enter the city, 
but please keep quiet. 
Everyone is sleeping.

## POINTER 6260
I am a gatekeeper 
for this city. We love having 
visitors from outside! <PAGE>If you arrived during the 
day, the entire city would have 
come out to welcome you.

Luckily, I'm studying the blastia, 
so I think we need to consider what to do 
after there are no more left.

## POINTER 6267
All work and no sleep! 
I'm gonna drop dead!

## POINTER 6268
But hey, HEY! 
I'm gonna do this!

Zaphias couldn't possibly

Will you be staying? 
That'll be 100 Gald.

Please come back and rest

I've made so many

Gold fish rescuing sounds fun but

In a way, I think I'm blessed

Ah, sweet memories... 
sweet memories... <PAGE>I have an abundance
of memories.

## POINTER 6278
An 8?
It's the most subtle<PAGE>The imagery
can feel LOW
but the structure is HIGH......

## POINTER 6279
I am going to wear this 
to the ball tonight. <PAGE>Well, it's only a Lantern Festival Dance though..

*Sniffle...* 
I'm so tired...<PAGE>It's gross, but it's 
not. It's actually 
sort of... cute...?

Just what is that 
thing, anyway...?

## POINTER 6282
I was worried when it was 
just my sister and me. Like, 
what if Cumore showed up?<PAGE>But everything's fine 
now that Dad's back.

## POINTER 6283
He still tells us to 
go to bed early, though. 
I guess nothing's perfect.

## POINTER 6284
Why can’t she sleep at night 
like a normal person? 
Such a fool for a daughter!

## POINTER 6285
She's besotted 
with Aifread!

## POINTER 6286
Years ago Aifread was 
the chief of the Pirate’s Guild, 
the “Siren’s Fangs”.<PAGE>And now my fool of a grandchild 
wants to reform the Guild!?

## POINTER 6287
It’s good to have grand dreams, 
but why, oh why 
the Pirate’s Guild?

## POINTER 6288
The sea at night is a dangerous creature, 
so why does my fool of a 
daughter go out there again?

## POINTER 6289
It's too late once an 
accident happens!

## POINTER 6290
It’s night, 
so why can’t she stay home?<PAGE>I just don’t know what to say to her...

## POINTER 6291
I can’t allow my 
granddaughter to go out to 
sea at such an ungodly hour!

## POINTER 6292
A monster fills our skies, 
and you want to go out to sea!?<PAGE>You are out of your mind child! 
And that’s a fact!

## POINTER 6293
I can't believe how stubborn she is! 
She certainly doesn't take after anyone in our family.

## POINTER 6294
Her passion got the better of me, 
but I can’t let her take a ship out at night!<PAGE>The night sea is still 
a dangerous place!

## POINTER 6295
I absolutely refuse to let her out at night! 
She will fall into bad company, I just know it!

## POINTER 6296
My senile old gramps forgot 
that he gave me a ship!<PAGE>But when I use it he lectures me and 
goes on and on about the dangers of the sea......

## POINTER 6297
Together they were known as the Don in the north, Belius in the south, 
and the king of the 
pirates was Aifread of the sea.<PAGE>But now all 
have gone...

## POINTER 6298
My gramps taught me the art 
of sailing, so the night 
holds no fears for me!

Can't I be trusted
