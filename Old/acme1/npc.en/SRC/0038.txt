## POINTER 3800
I'm raring to go! I'm ready 
for the future that's sure 
to come. Let's work together!

## POINTER 3801
*Woof woof woooof*

## POINTER 3802
Building a town 
from out of the wilderness. 
It's simply revolutionary!<PAGE>This is the dawn of 
a new generation!

## POINTER 3803
Now, if only the 
monsters were gone...<PAGE>Now, I'm getting 
a little greedy...

## POINTER 3804
I was set on proposing. 
That's why I called her here.<PAGE>B-but, I can't seem to 
convey my feelings to her.

## POINTER 3805
OK, take a 
deeeeep breath...<PAGE>OK!!<PAGE>Here I go...<PAGE>OK... Here I go...<PAGE>Now's the time...<PAGE>......<PAGE>I can't... 
I just can't...

## POINTER 3806
You have something 
important to tell me? 
I'll be here for awhile...<PAGE>This is fun, so I 
don't mind just waiting 
here like this...

## POINTER 3807
I know it... 
He's gonna ask me to marry 
him. I just know it...<PAGE>...Of course, I'll say "no."

## POINTER 3808
This town's called 
Aurnion. Or did you 
already know that?

## POINTER 3809
<STR>(FRE) made it, so if you 
ask me, they should 
have called it <STR>(FRE)town.

## POINTER 3810
Listen up!! 
Everyone seems settled 
here in this town.<PAGE>But I want to go back... 
I want to go back to Zaphias!

## POINTER 3811
But, recently, I haven't been 
able to press too much 
about going back to Zaphias...<PAGE>He just tells 
me to go alone...

## POINTER 3812
All right, folks...
We built a town, now 
let's build a castle!

## POINTER 3813
Right now I feel like 
we can do anything!

## POINTER 3814
I'm glad I came here. 
I never thought I'd have people 
truly thankful for what I do.

## POINTER 3815
I'm so lucky to 
be a craftsman!

## POINTER 3816
*Meowow∀*

## POINTER 3817
*Mew mew mew*

## POINTER 3818
What are all the strong 
guys gathered up for?<PAGE>A game? Is it a game? 
A fighting game!

## POINTER 3819
I wonder who's 
gonna fight who.<PAGE>I hope it's not 
too scary.

## POINTER 3820
...What's going on?<PAGE>It's not a festival. 
I know that much...

## POINTER 3821
It's kind of scary... 
What's with everyone...?

## POINTER 3822
The Don died...

## POINTER 3823
Why did the Don
have to die? He 
wasn't a bad guy...

## POINTER 3824
Mommy says things 
are bad in Zaphias.

## POINTER 3825
If things are bad, 
we have to go help.

## POINTER 3826
Waaah, waaah...<PAGE>...*Hiccup*...

## POINTER 3827
...If I keep crying, 
the crybaby gods might 
come and eat me...

## POINTER 3828
Things certainly are 
lively in town recently.

## POINTER 3829
It's a good thing. 
Young folk should 
be lively.

## POINTER 3830
The Don... What's he 
trying to do...? 
No... It can't be...

## POINTER 3831
The Don can't 
be thinking of... 
No, impossible...

## POINTER 3832
How could things possibly 
get any worse...?

## POINTER 3833
It seems like there's nothing 
good to talk about lately.

## POINTER 3834
What is going to happen 
to our world?

## POINTER 3835
If there isn't any 
cheerful news, I guess we'll 
have to make our own.

## POINTER 3836
Turn a lux blastia on, 
and everything's bright...<PAGE>There. Didn't that 
just brighten up 
your day...?

## POINTER 3837
*Sniffle...* 
I'm so tired...<PAGE>I'm scared... 
No I'm not... 
Yes I am!

## POINTER 3838
Maybe it isn't gonna 
fall after all...?

## POINTER 3839
You're the ones 
that really saved 
this town, right?<PAGE>Then why is everyone 
thanking the Knights?

## POINTER 3840
Grown-ups are weird.

## POINTER 3841
The new Knights are all 
so nice... Totally different 
from Cumore's Knights.<PAGE>But they're still 
taking credit for 
your work. Why?

## POINTER 3842
Grown-ups are really weird.

## POINTER 3843
My little sister's so scared. 
How can I get her 
to calm down?<PAGE>I'm even scared 
myself...

## POINTER 3844
I'm scared 
myself, but...<PAGE>I'm her big brother. 
I've got to be brave.

## POINTER 3845
Have you seen it? That thing 
in the sky. How can something 
that big stay afloat?<PAGE>Hmm? There are more important 
things than how it floats? Oh 
whatever. Details, details...

## POINTER 3846
Do you think it has wings? 
Or maybe a blastia?

## POINTER 3847
You know about the city in the sky, 
right? I bet it's got something 
to do with that monster up there.<PAGE>Don't you get it? Advertising! 
That thing's a big ad for the flying 
city. Business must be booming.

## POINTER 3848
That gives me an idea... Maybe 
I should try advertising, too. It 
might make my life a lot easier...

## POINTER 3849
......<PAGE>......

## POINTER 3850
Outta my way!
I'm in a foul mood!

## POINTER 3851
Our guild, the Blood Alliance, is 
in a state of confusion, but we will 
fulfill our assignments here. <PAGE>The Imperial Council is 
paying us good money.

## POINTER 3852
It'd be great if the Guilds
were gone and they hire me.

## POINTER 3853
I was told not to let anyone
who had no business here
near the building.<PAGE>Sorry, but please go.
Orders are orders.

## POINTER 3854
Only authorized personnel 
are permitted entry.

## POINTER 3855
Although the magistrate is trying 
to return to Zaphias, I wonder 
what he's planning to do. <PAGE>At the moment, he's in a meeting 
with the assistant magistrate.

## POINTER 3856
They haven't paid us...
Are we even getting paid?

## POINTER 3857
The magistrate is out.
Come back later.

## POINTER 3858
The last magistrate was
bad, but the new one just
doesn't do a thing.<PAGE>He's worthless and
incompetent.

## POINTER 3859
What on earth is happening
to this world?!

## POINTER 3860
They've lost communication
with Zaphias and the magistrate
is not getting paid...<PAGE>Are they really going to pay us...?

## POINTER 3861
Where's our money...?

## POINTER 3862
I just came from Zaphias.
I suggest you steer clear from it.<PAGE>The Imperial Knights captain has
taken control of the place and the
atmosphere there is very disturbing.

## POINTER 3863
That guy over there wants
to be a writer. I've read his
work. It's not that great.

## POINTER 3864
Eveyone I know has gone
to Hypionia up north.<PAGE>I stayed behind because
I can't leave him alone.

## POINTER 3865
He's all alone, you see?
Ahh...I can't leave him like that.

## POINTER 3866
He's too old to be
living in a daydream...<PAGE>He needs to be more like
that knight, <STR>(FRE) and
turn his dreams into a reality.

## POINTER 3867
He's probably the same
age as <STR>(FRE). <STR>(FRE)'s a lot
more mature though.

## POINTER 3868
What's that tower-like,
mountain-like, city-like
thing?<PAGE>Do you have any idea?

## POINTER 3869
I wonder if someone lives
there? Do you think we
can go there?

## POINTER 3870
Life doesn't happen
like in a novel.<PAGE>I hope she can open
her eyes and face
reality soon.

## POINTER 3871
There must be something
wrong with me, too.<PAGE>Why am I getting so worked
up over a perfect stranger?

## POINTER 3872
The Don was a great man.

## POINTER 3873
Why do the good
guys die and the
bad guys live?

## POINTER 3874
Life is not fair.

## POINTER 3875
Someone out there is
probably dying right now.

## POINTER 3876
So, some big ring has risen
up beyond the sea?<PAGE>That's really something.
It's bigger than that ring
a guy once got me...

## POINTER 3877
That ring...?
I threw it into
the sea here.<PAGE>Bittersweet memories...

## POINTER 3878
I wish I hadn't lived
so long to see that
come out of the sky!

## POINTER 3879
I wonder if I'll be
safe if I stay in town.

## POINTER 3880
All the men around me
have protected me.<PAGE>Are you going to protect
me from that monster?

## POINTER 3881
Really? You really are a
nice guy. You're not going
to leave me, are you?

## POINTER 3882
After the previous riots, 
we assumed the duty of maintaining 
security in this town.<PAGE>And we will continue to keep a watch over 
this town until our orders are receded, 
no matter how the people of this town may feel.

## POINTER 3883
The people here have something
against the knights. But, we're
here under orders.<PAGE>There's nothing we can do
if they won't open up to us.

## POINTER 3884
We're under orders to be on patrol.
Something seems to be happening
to the sky, but that's not our concern.

## POINTER 3885
If there's anything that would
threaten the safety of this town,
we'll do our best to prevent it.

## POINTER 3886
Sometimes the citizens
would greet us.<PAGE>I'm not sure what made them open
their hearts to us, but I hope they
understand our good intentions...

## POINTER 3887
The other day, an old 
woman left some steamed 
buns with us.<PAGE>They were piping-hot and 
actually quite delicious...

## POINTER 3888
The citizens give us these
cold stares. Maybe we're
not welcome here...<PAGE>I guess I can understand
how they feel though...

## POINTER 3889
Even though we're
here to help...

## POINTER 3890
They threw rocks at us...
They told us to arrest them...<PAGE>If we do, they'll just 
hate us even more...

## POINTER 3891
I'm not cut out
to be a knight...<PAGE>Maybe I should
find a new job.

## POINTER 3892
The Schwann Brigade received orders
from Lieutenant Leblanc to be dispatched
here to support the <STR>(FRE) Brigade!

## POINTER 3893
Captain Schwann is very busy 
on an assignment away from here, 
but I shall not do anything 
to disgrace his name!

## POINTER 3894
We're under orders from
Leiutenant Leblanc to
support the <STR>(FRE) Brigade!

## POINTER 3895
If we complete our assignment
well, Captain Schwann will give
us a high rating.<PAGE>When that happens,
we will be happy and
the captain will be happy.

## POINTER 3896
We have the rights
to arrest anyone who
even looked suspicious.<PAGE>That’s the reason why
the town is safe.

## POINTER 3897
We don’t want to get forceful.
We hope no one tries anything funny.

## POINTER 3898
You guys aren’t part of the
Hunting Blades, are you?<PAGE>If you are, I’m going to
Have to arrest you at once.

## POINTER 3899
If not, then that's fine.<PAGE>I don't want to arrest
anyone who's innocent.
