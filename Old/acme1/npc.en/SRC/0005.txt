## POINTER 500
As the Tree protects us, 
we shall protect the Tree.

## POINTER 501
What are Imperial Knights 
doing in Halure...?

## POINTER 502
I fear they might do something 
to damage the Tree.

## POINTER 503
The Knights left the 
city afterwards. <PAGE>What in the world did 
they come for? You 
can't just work people up.

## POINTER 504
They didn't protect 
us before, so what 
do they want now?

## POINTER 505
Our fates are intertwined with 
that of the Tree of Halure.

## POINTER 506
We can decide 
our own destiny.<PAGE>If we can keep the 
Tree of Halure safe...

## POINTER 507
The Empire and the Knights 
always make fun of us. <PAGE>I guess the Knights and 
the government are not 
friends of the people.

## POINTER 508
Good Knights, bad Knights... 
Can we trust the 
Knights, can we not...? <PAGE>The only thing 
that's clear is that 
the top guy is bad.

## POINTER 509
The current situation may 
not be favorable... but we 
must stop lamenting the past.

## POINTER 510
We can't live looking backwards. 
We must move ever forwards.

## POINTER 511
The disaster was unfortunate. 
As long as we still live, 
however, there is hope.

## POINTER 512
I'm going to do my 
best to bring the 
survivors happiness.

## POINTER 513
Sometimes living can 
me more difficult than 
surrendering to death.

## POINTER 514
Nevertheless, 
we must live on. <PAGE>We must put forth an effort 
not to just survive, but to thrive.

## POINTER 515
I feel bad for 
relying on outsiders 
for help, but... <PAGE>Please, you have 
to do something...

## POINTER 516
The luluria flower... 
Please use it wisely.

## POINTER 517
Thanks to you, the Tree 
is blooming wonderfully! <PAGE>Thank you! 
Thank you so much!

## POINTER 518
Please stop by our 
city again anytime.

## POINTER 519
Ever since you helped us out, 
I've been telling people about 
the miracle of that young lady. <PAGE>I hope you don't mind...

## POINTER 520
Mirale sandwiches, miracle 
candy... I've been thinking 
up a lot of products too.

## POINTER 521
I'm so happy. 
Now we can all enjoy 
the flowers again.

## POINTER 522
There are so many 
tourists lately!

## POINTER 523
This is a tranquil 
town, famous for our 
beautiful flowers.

## POINTER 524
This is the City of Blossoms, 
Halure. We have many refugees 
from the capital now.

## POINTER 525
This is Halure. 
Please feel free to relax 
and get some rest. <PAGE>...But I know that's hard 
with so many people.

## POINTER 526
Nothing blooms forever 
in this world. <PAGE>All that breathes 
will someday stop.

## POINTER 527
That was just about 
our last moment alive. 
That was it.

## POINTER 528
A miracle. I don't 
know who said it, 
but it's beautiful. <PAGE>But we have to remember 
that miracles don't 
happen twice.

## POINTER 529
A miracle that happens 
often isn't a miracle.

## POINTER 530
If beautiful flowers should give 
you pleasure, show your gratitude 
to the roots that birthed them...

## POINTER 531
It's an old saying 
we have in Halure.

## POINTER 532
The Tree of Halure
may be massive, but even 
it began as a sprout.

## POINTER 533
You could say it was watered by the 
blood, sweat and tears of the people 
that have always tended to it.

## POINTER 534
I think this will 
bring down the glory 
of the capital... <PAGE>Pride goes before 
the fall...

## POINTER 535
Even if the capital 
was destroyed, 
it's people weren't. <PAGE>The youth must be 
strong and live.

## POINTER 536
Welcome! 
We're having a sale in celebration 
of the Tree of Halure's rebirth!

## POINTER 537
Welcome! We finally got 
some new products! We have 
a great selection of armor!

## POINTER 538
The Tree of Halure is 
not doing well. <PAGE>I have to get a doctor 
to examine the Tree!

## POINTER 539
But are there doctors 
for trees...?

## POINTER 540
Ho! Listen! The Tree of 
Halure has come 
back to life! <PAGE>Uh... I didn't mean 
to say, "Ho." 
...Hey!

## POINTER 541
I guess a doctor came 
to see the Tree.

## POINTER 542
Some Knights came by. One 
of them kept saying, "I 
say, I say" over and over.<PAGE>That's so weird...

## POINTER 543
Hey, mister, what do 
you think they wanted?

## POINTER 544
Fall, snow... come on, snow. <PAGE>This is what snow is like, 
right? What do you mean, 
you don't know?! Weak...

## POINTER 545
If these flower petals 
fell for 100 years, they would 
bury the houses.

## POINTER 546
I didn't know there was 
trouble in Dahngrest. 
It seems pretty bad.

## POINTER 547
Not that it has anything 
to do with us.

## POINTER 548
There were a lot of people 
pushing and shoving. 
They were like waves.

## POINTER 549
Why are those 
pepole from the 
capital so arogant. <PAGE>They just happened to be 
born there! It's just luck!

## POINTER 550
I always felt so relieved and 
at peace when I looked around 
at this city's flowers. <PAGE>I can't believe this 
could happen...

## POINTER 551
This world is full 
of suffering... <PAGE>But looking at the flowers 
in this city makes me 
glad that I'm alive.

## POINTER 552
Oh... I'm so glad the 
Tree came back to life...

## POINTER 553
I don't like a whole lot of 
commotion, but I hate not being 
able to just live my life in peace. <PAGE>I wonder if it was good 
or bad that the 
Imperial Knights came.

## POINTER 554
It would be nice if this world 
would continue to be peaceful 
without the Imperial Knights.

## POINTER 555
The flowers blossom beautifully. <PAGE>However, withered flower 
petals that bury the city 
aren't necessarily beautiful.

## POINTER 556
Even beautiful things may 
not always be beautiful 
in their last moments.

## POINTER 557
They bloom and wither, bloom and 
wither... The flowers of Halure
always repeat this cycle. <PAGE>All of this is 
due to the direct 
blessings from aer.

## POINTER 558
Ahh, this is really 
a magnificent city...

## POINTER 559
I'm worried whether those people 
who escaped from Zaphias will 
pay respect to that Tree. <PAGE>I wonder if we should 
teach everyone just how 
precious the blossoms are.

## POINTER 560
No... 
Maybe we should just 
mind our own business?

## POINTER 561
Although the life of the 
flower is short, it still 
blooms with all its energy. <PAGE>I really like to 
watch these flowers.

## POINTER 562
One day I'll die, my body 
will return to the ground, and 
flowers will bloom above me. <PAGE>I want to continue 
living forever, giving 
energy to the flowers.

## POINTER 563
I may also die soon. <PAGE>Why? 
Because my body 
feels really weak.

## POINTER 564
I don't have any regrets, 
even if I die tomorrow. <PAGE>Why? 
Because I can die under 
those beautiful flowers.

## POINTER 565
I really like looking at the 
flowers... Having drinks while 
just gazing at the flowers...

## POINTER 566
I wonder if those happy 
days will come again?

## POINTER 567
We'll be able to watch the 
blossoms again... Having drinks 
while watching the blossoms...

## POINTER 568
Flower viewing, 
flower viewing!â™ª

## POINTER 569
I thought the Imperial 
Knights also came to 
watch the blossoms. <PAGE>Because they were 
loud even though they 
weren't drinking.

## POINTER 570
Do you want to check out the 
blossoms together? We'll 
have a good time. Trust me.

## POINTER 571
Good drinks and 
beautiful blossoms... <PAGE>They say, "Food over 
flowers," but you 
gotta have both.

## POINTER 572
I'm so glad that 
I came to this city. <PAGE>My hometown in the middle of 
the mountains looks bleak.

## POINTER 573
It's nice being able 
to relax and look 
at the flowers.

## POINTER 574
Ohhhh, so relaxed... 
Ohhhh, so drunk...

## POINTER 575
It's fun as more people gather. 
Ahh... I know that we don't 
have time to have fun. <PAGE>But I thought it 
would be okay as it 
was getting noisier.

## POINTER 576
It would be 
better if everyone 
lived here. <PAGE>Why don't you just 
hand over the capital
to the Commandant?

## POINTER 577
Isn't it great that 
the Tree of Halure
was revived? <PAGE>But... we're worried about 
what we should do to ensure 
the Tree does not die.

## POINTER 578
The more the Tree blooms, 
the more concerned I am. 
Hmmm...

## POINTER 579
Why did the Knights come 
to this city? Are they 
here to collect taxes? <PAGE>I think we paid last month. 
Yeah, we paid... 
Wait... Did we?

## POINTER 580
Am I going to get arrested 
if I didn't pay taxes? 
Hmmmm....

## POINTER 581
The water here is said 
to spring out from the 
trunk of the Tree. <PAGE>Even if that was true, do you 
really think this much water 
would just keep coming out?

## POINTER 582
Do you think that the 
Tree will run out of 
water and wither again?

## POINTER 583
How did the Tree grow so big...? 
I can't sleep through the night 
when I ponder this question. <PAGE>There are so many 
things to think about 
with this town...<PAGE>Hmmmm...

## POINTER 584
There are just too 
many things to think 
about in life!

## POINTER 585
Why are there 
this many people? <PAGE>This is a small city! 
We can only handle so many 
people... *Grumble*...

## POINTER 586
About 40,000 people per square 
kilometer... Know what that is? The 
population density of this city. <PAGE>Normally It's about 30 people... 
Something is way out of whack!

## POINTER 587
I traveled all the way 
here to see the flowers... 
But the Tree has withered.

## POINTER 588
This is no time for 
flower viewing, it would seem...

## POINTER 589
I traveled all the way here 
to see the flowers...
I'm glad it wasn't a waste.

## POINTER 590
I wonder when the best 
time for flower viewing is?

## POINTER 591
What do the Knights 
want in Halure?

## POINTER 592
I doubt they came 
for flower viewing!

## POINTER 593
Why don't I get tired of 
watching the flowers all day?

## POINTER 594
Even if I was watching a 
beautiful woman, I'd get 
tired of her in a single night...

## POINTER 595
The flowers bloom, then fall... 
Year after year, the same cycle.

## POINTER 596
I suppose our lives are 
much the same thing...

## POINTER 597
I want people from the capital who 
have faced horrendous times to 
look at the flowers and be healed. <PAGE>And then I want them 
to tell the world just 
how good Halure is.

## POINTER 598
No matter what's going on, looking 
at such beautiful trees makes you 
feel like everything will be okay.

## POINTER 599
Now we'll be safe even 
if the monsters attack.
