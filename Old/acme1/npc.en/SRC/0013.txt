## POINTER 1300
Th-this town has always 
been that way. There's 
nothing to worry about.

## POINTER 1301
See? I was right. 
The Don took care 
of things.

## POINTER 1302
Th-this town has always 
been that way. See? 
Nothing to worry about.

## POINTER 1303
The Empire, the Knights... 
Nobody in this town 
trusts them at all.

## POINTER 1304
The Imperial Council and the Knights 
wouldn't stand a chance if the guilds
banded together to take them on.

## POINTER 1305
Curse that Barbos! 
He's disgraced the guilds!

## POINTER 1306
This isn't any time 
for the guilds to 
be fighting!

## POINTER 1307
Guess things got 
wrapped up nicely.

## POINTER 1308
That Ragou guy 
got away, though...

## POINTER 1309
I respect the Don, but 
I'm not big on the idea 
of a friendship treaty.

## POINTER 1310
I can't believe the 
Don would sign a treaty 
with the Empire...<PAGE>Wait, this is the Don. 
Could it be to throw 
the Empire off guard?

## POINTER 1311
What the hell is that?!

## POINTER 1312
I never seen anything 
like that, much less 
eaten anything like it!

## POINTER 1313
The fun never 
ends in this town.<PAGE>But I guess Dahngrest
wouldn't be Dahngrest
if it were quiet.

## POINTER 1314
Of course, that's exactly 
why I like Dahngrest.<PAGE>It'd be missing something 
if it were just some 
quiet, sleepy town.

## POINTER 1315
I get the feeling the old 
era is ending, and a new 
one is about to begin.

## POINTER 1316
It's so exciting to 
live in times of change.

## POINTER 1317
What's going to 
happen now?

## POINTER 1318
My uneasiness is 
like a dark cloud 
moving into my heart.

## POINTER 1319
We have to protect this 
town ourselves. We don't 
have anyone else to rely on.

## POINTER 1320
This is the time for all guilds
to pull their strength together.

## POINTER 1321
Is it imprudent of me 
to think that this state 
of the world is...fun?

## POINTER 1322
People are coming together 
now. Even if the world came 
to an end now, I'd die happy.

## POINTER 1323
My mommy's a guild
bigshot! Really! 
I even met the Don!

## POINTER 1324
The Don's an even 
bigger bigshot! Not just 
anybody can meet him.

## POINTER 1325
Waaah, waaah...

## POINTER 1326
Mommy! Mommy! 
Where are you?!

## POINTER 1327
My mommy fought, too! I'm 
gonna be a guild when 
I grow up, just like her!

## POINTER 1328
When I grow up, I'm 
gonna be a guild!
...Be a...guild?

## POINTER 1329
Even if the Empire attacks, 
the Don'll beat them up good!

## POINTER 1330
Even if the Empire attacks, 
I'm going to help the Don
fight them!

## POINTER 1331
Mommy says someone called 
Barbos is the bad guy.

## POINTER 1332
Don't you wish 
bad guys would all 
just go away?

## POINTER 1333
We're back at peace! 
That's what my mommy said.

## POINTER 1334
Even the neighbors 
were saying that 
peace is best.

## POINTER 1335
Now we're gonna be 
friends with the Empire?

## POINTER 1336
I guess being 
friends is nice.

## POINTER 1337
Mommy says something's 
gonna happen.

## POINTER 1338
They say something's gonna 
happen, but what? A party?

## POINTER 1339
It sure is crazy out there. 
Fancy a drink before you go?

## POINTER 1340
I wanna go see what's 
going on out there, but 
I got customers to serve.

## POINTER 1341
We got anything you want.
Fancy a drink before you go?

## POINTER 1342
Zaphias Brew, Ehmead Snow, Dese 
Draft... They're good drinks 
that do down like water.

## POINTER 1343
We'll hold a banquet 
here when the friendship 
treaty is signed.

## POINTER 1344
I'll bring out the really good 
booze when that happens!

## POINTER 1345
What was that noise? Another 
monster? If you need another 
hand, I have one to lend.

## POINTER 1346
Even if it means I have to use 
an empty bottle as a weapon, 
I'll do it to protect this town.

## POINTER 1347
The customers have a lot 
to complain about lately.<PAGE>I know what that's like.

## POINTER 1348
But it's part of 
my job to listen,
so I can't join in.

## POINTER 1349
Careful not to drown your 
cares in too much drink. You'll 
just make yourself sick.

## POINTER 1350
The Don was quite 
a drinker, you know.
He came by often.

## POINTER 1351
Fancy a drink before you go?

## POINTER 1352
What do you like? 
Cocktails? Wine? Whiskey?<PAGE>Or maybe rain water is good 
enough for you? We also have hot 
miso soup, if that's your fancy.

## POINTER 1353
Many customers come here
as an escape from reality.<PAGE>Personal relationships
in the guilds can be
pretty stressful.

## POINTER 1354
Even I work here
to escape from reality.

## POINTER 1355
Have any troubles 
you want to unload?
I'll listen to anything.<PAGE>I am the bartender 
here, after all.

## POINTER 1356
I'm the bartender, 
not the bar or a bender. 
The bartender!

## POINTER 1357
Hmph... I can't even drink in 
peace and quiet in this town.

## POINTER 1358
Seriously, what is all 
the commotion about?

## POINTER 1359
Barbos... That's the chief 
of the Blood Alliance, right?

## POINTER 1360
I hear that guy
has some skill.

## POINTER 1361
So Barbos is gone, huh?

## POINTER 1362
People dying... 
That's exactly how 
times change.

## POINTER 1363
Someone long ago once told me
that work is what you make of it.<PAGE>If I have to make it,
then I'd rather not bother.

## POINTER 1364
...Isn't there any work?

## POINTER 1365
What? A monster 
convered in flames?
You drunk?

## POINTER 1366
Yeah, I'm drunk, 
but I ain't about to say 
anything stupid like you.

## POINTER 1367
I'm just a mercenary. 
What was I thinking, helping 
to repair that bridge?<PAGE>Well, I guess it would 
be pretty inconvenient 
without a bridge.

## POINTER 1368
Now that the bridge is fixed, 
they're having me figure out 
the costs of the repairs.<PAGE>I'm telling you, this 
is not part of my job.

## POINTER 1369
The Don was 
the Don, right 
to the end.

## POINTER 1370
I've never met any other man
like the Don in my whole life.

## POINTER 1371
There's trouble in the Empire? 
 Well, that news makes my day.

## POINTER 1372
There's trouble in the Empire? 
Well, that's nothing new.

## POINTER 1373
Things are so bad lately 
I can't even get by 
without a drink.

## POINTER 1374
Ooooh... *Hic!*

## POINTER 1375
Nothing is solved by 
drinking. I know that.<PAGE>But I can't get by 
without my alcohol.

## POINTER 1376
*Hic!* I can't believe I'm 
drunk after 10 iced teas...

## POINTER 1377
I ain't drunk!

## POINTER 1378
I'm tellin' ya, I ain't drunk!

## POINTER 1379
The world's in crisis! 
Now I'm gonna save it!

## POINTER 1380
Huh? No, I'm not drunk.

## POINTER 1381
This is a fine drink. 
Fortune's Market sure knows 
how to pick the right stuff.

## POINTER 1382
When business is good,
drinking is that much more fun.

## POINTER 1383
I make my own way no matter how 
crazy things get. That's how you do 
things when you're part of a guild.

## POINTER 1384
It's a disgrace for a guildsman
to get caught up in every new 
trend that comes along.

## POINTER 1385
I come here every day...
I wonder if I'm living a decent life...

## POINTER 1386
I know my tab 
is getting up there...<PAGE>What's even scarier is no one's 
pressuring me to pay...

## POINTER 1387
I haven't done 
any real work lately.

## POINTER 1388
Guess it doesn't matter.

## POINTER 1389
Monsters, you say? 
Where are your manners? 
Can't you see I'm drinking?<PAGE>Ask someone else 
who has the time.

## POINTER 1390
These guys drink all day. 
If you need a favor, ask around 
for someone with nothing to do.

## POINTER 1391
I hear someone let slip 
that Leviathan's Claw
is making a move.<PAGE>I guess it's tough
everywhere you go.

## POINTER 1392
Nothing good ever 
comes when Leviathan's 
Claw makes a move.

## POINTER 1393
There are times when 
you just want to drink and 
forget about everything.

## POINTER 1394
Sometimes you just can't get 
anything done. I'm just biding 
my time until I can do something.

## POINTER 1395
Drinks can fool even 
terminal illnesses.

## POINTER 1396
Alcohol is the cure for everything.
But don't go drinking too much.

## POINTER 1397
I want to do something 
before I really regret it.

## POINTER 1398
But I just can't pry 
my hands off this bottle...

## POINTER 1399
I heard there's a sword style 
called Drunken Sword. It lets 
you fight even while drinking.<PAGE>I want to learn it.
