## POINTER 3300
I got a new dollie!<PAGE>I'm so happy.

## POINTER 3301
Now I can eat any food I want, 
and I get anything I ask for...<PAGE>But, for some reason, 
I'm not very happy...

## POINTER 3302
Is all this stuff really 
what we wanted?<PAGE>Living in so much comfort 
isn't fun at all...and 
I'm not happy.

## POINTER 3303
There are many inconvenient things 
about living in poverty...<PAGE>But I wouldn't say it's an unhappy life.

## POINTER 3304
There may not be any wonderful 
living in this town.<PAGE>Instead, I think we 
can live wonderfully.

## POINTER 3305
One of the good things about 
being poor is that you never 
have to worry about burglars.

## POINTER 3306
You're only poor because 
you think you're poor.<PAGE>I'm fine as long as I 
think I'm satisfied.

## POINTER 3307
It is said that God treats 
every person equally.<PAGE>Powerful, weak, rich, 
or poor...how thankful 
we must be for this!

## POINTER 3308
If people are going to venerate an 
entity as witless as this God...<PAGE>Who needs him! Don't 
you agree?

## POINTER 3309
As long as you have bread...and 
don't starve...<PAGE>...you can endure almost anything, 
no matter how painful.

## POINTER 3310
Compared to the meal that 
relieves a day's hunger...<PAGE>...nothing else has 
any real value.

## POINTER 3311
This is the armory.<PAGE>You may not enter 
without permission.

## POINTER 3312
I think people should be more 
concerned with buying bread 
before they buy armaments...

## POINTER 3313
"The unavoidable battle is just, 
and weapons are sanctified when 
they offer the only hope"...<PAGE>In a certain sense, those 
words may be true.

## POINTER 3314
Even so, weapons are weapons 
no matter the circumstances: 
Tools for killing.<PAGE>How could they 
ever be considered 
sanctified?

## POINTER 3315
Why do wars occur...?<PAGE>Perhaps because men respond 
to weapons with more weapons.

## POINTER 3316
I've been thinking...<PAGE>If men were to respond to weapons with 
bread, there would be no more war.

## POINTER 3317
Peace is not simply a state of no war.<PAGE>Peace is a virtue, and a state of mind. 
Peace is a mind seeking benevolence, 
belief in the self, and justice.

## POINTER 3318
I pray that this world and the people 
who live upon it will find peace...

## POINTER 3319
The first step to stabilizing a country 
is the eradication of poverty.<PAGE>Saving the people of this town 
is saving the country itself.

## POINTER 3320
When the lives of the people are 
enriched, so is their country.<PAGE>It's simply a matter of course.

## POINTER 3321
The peace we Knights can 
ensure is only temporary.<PAGE>If people only want peace for 
a year, they may rely on us.

## POINTER 3322
However, should the people want a century 
of peace...they must unite to protect 
the Empire for themselves.<PAGE>This country has within it a power 
superior to a thousand armies.

## POINTER 3323
The Empire is a sailing vessel, 
its people the winds...<PAGE>How these winds act upon the sail of politics 
will determine whether or not the rough 
seas of the age can be crossed.

## POINTER 3324
You're brave to 
leave the city.<PAGE>...Are you a hero?

## POINTER 3325
Life is but a series of battles...and 
death marks their end.<PAGE>To rush into battle with no fear of dying 
is nothing but sheer imprudence.

## POINTER 3326
We must fight to live!<PAGE>One cannot fight if they are dead...

## POINTER 3327
In order to stabilize 
the country, we must 
first eradicate poverty! <PAGE>Saving the citizens of this city 
is the way to save the country.

## POINTER 3328
Power is appropriate only for 
those who know how to wield it.

## POINTER 3329
If one desires power they must 
work for it. They must work 
for it if it kills them.<PAGE>Nobody who's said they'd accomplish 
something "if it killed them" has 
ever actually been killed, you know.

## POINTER 3330
You should be wary of those who strive towards 
a goal without saying anything at all.<PAGE>People like that go to their 
graves silently...

## POINTER 3331
Today proudly valiant, tomorrow 
lying in our graves...<PAGE>That is a knight's very way of life.

## POINTER 3332
This may not be appropriate for a knight 
such as myself to say, but...I believe 
man must bring war to an end.<PAGE>If we do not, war may bring 
all manking to its end...

## POINTER 3333
I take pride in my 
status as a knight.<PAGE>At the same time, I wish for a world at 
peace with no need for knights at all.

## POINTER 3334
How many people there are that feed 
upon the blood of the innocent...!

## POINTER 3335
Cumore and the knights under 
his command have cleared out.<PAGE>Things should finally be getting 
much saner in this town.

## POINTER 3336
I hope Heliord will be a place where 
hard-working people will find reward.

## POINTER 3337
Like many others, I joined the Knights 
because I always admired them...<PAGE>However, the reality of being a knight is 
much less exciting than I had thought.

## POINTER 3338
The Knights do not exist to 
fight ostentatious battles.<PAGE>We are here to protect the peace! 
That alone is our sole purpose.

## POINTER 3339
A war can be begun with nothing 
more than a single dagger...<PAGE>...but the ending of war is a trying task 
for even the most battle-hardened hero.

## POINTER 3340
The only thing capable of staunching 
bloodshed is reason...

## POINTER 3341
If you had to choose between 
a just war, or an unjust peace...which 
would it be?<PAGE>There is no such 
thing as a just war.

## POINTER 3342
In my studies, I have learned 
that there has never been 
a war one might term just.<PAGE>Peace is preferable to any 
war that might be imagined.

## POINTER 3343
If you want to pass, then pass.

## POINTER 3344
You may go!

## POINTER 3345
Discipline has returned to Heliord.<PAGE>It is a fine thing.

## POINTER 3346
Discipline is the most important virtue of 
all! Second comes perseverance, third bravery, 
then gallantry, and finally ambition...<PAGE>Do you agree?

## POINTER 3347
Weakness is something only the 
common man is permitted.<PAGE>Strength, above all, is 
expected of a knight.

## POINTER 3348
A knight cannot live without strength, yet 
an unkind man is not qualified to live.<PAGE>Will I be able to become a knight 
of both strength and kindness?

## POINTER 3349
Nobody is born strong. Everyone 
begins life weak.<PAGE>I believe that coming to know one's 
weaknesses, one by one, is the 
way people become stronger.

## POINTER 3350
A place where even the 
weak can survive, 
without adapting...<PAGE>I would like for nothing more than 
Heliord to become that sort of 
place, but reality is harsh.

## POINTER 3351
By poring over the history 
books, it is clear that they 
are all records of war.<PAGE>I am sure the future holds 
countless more wars.

## POINTER 3352
Even so, we must not accept 
war as mankind's fate.<PAGE>One thing we must learn from our history 
writ in blood: The will to follow through to 
the very end, to avoiding war entirely.

## POINTER 3353
The commodities Cumore had monopolized will 
now be distributed amongst the citizens.<PAGE>The lives of the laborers here should 
become a little bit easier.

## POINTER 3354
Nothing will change 
overnight, though.<PAGE>We are prepared to make every 
effort to help them.

## POINTER 3355
All men are born the same, but individual 
ways of living are to each his own; even 
more innumerable are their ways of death.<PAGE>Nevertheless, we believe the 
knights live with one will, 
and must die with one will.

## POINTER 3356
Most people are born crying, 
live complaining, 
and die despairing.<PAGE>I, however, wish to live 
life to its utmost, dying 
a satisfied man.

## POINTER 3357
The regret that comes from having 
failed to act is far deeper than 
that of having acted and failed.<PAGE>I beseech you...never claim 
you are unable to act at 
a time when you must.

## POINTER 3358
People are often more concerned 
with the possessions of their 
neighbors than with their own.<PAGE>Try not to be distracted by the possessions of 
others...for you may find yourself forgetting 
the precious things you already have.

## POINTER 3359
Have you ever thought 
about your life?<PAGE>Are you conscious of the fact that 
the moment that just passed, gone 
forever, was a part of that life?

## POINTER 3360
A fleeting moment is but a short lifetime...and 
a lifetime is nothing more than a long moment.<PAGE>One must live every moment as earnestly as 
if it were their entire life, their life 
as relaxed as if it were a single moment.

## POINTER 3361
Our leaders may change, but 
our daily work does not.<PAGE>Of course, I'd be glad if those new 
leaders bring with them a fair rule.

## POINTER 3362
I can imagine no greater happiness than having 
my work be of benefit to this town.

## POINTER 3363
One must never turn back simply 
because the mountain is tall.<PAGE>As long as you keep putting one foot in front of the 
other, any mountain can eventually be crossed.

## POINTER 3364
One must not become lackadaisical simply 
because their work is difficult.<PAGE>By continuing to tackle each problem one by 
one, any job can eventually be finished.

## POINTER 3365
The most important thing in work...
No, the most important thing living 
as a human being...is trust.<PAGE>One cannot leave important work, 
nor precious monies to people 
who cannot be trusted.

## POINTER 3366
One must do the same things, the 
same way, day in, day out.<PAGE>There is no other 
way to gain trust.

## POINTER 3367
Gaining trust takes a great 
deal of time, but it can be 
lost in the blink of an eye.<PAGE>If you keep that fact in mind, the way 
you live your life will surely change.

## POINTER 3368
I will regain the trust I lost today 
by working harder tomorrow!<PAGE>I'll do everything in 
my power to do so.

## POINTER 3369
You can quit any time you want. 
You may find relief, but...<PAGE>You will also lose a great deal.

## POINTER 3370
On the other hand, persevering 
may be painful and difficult...<PAGE>But I believe rewards equal to one's 
perseverance always follow.

## POINTER 3371
You mustn't vacillate about your life.<PAGE>All the thinking in the world won't ever answer 
the question, "what is the meaning of life?".

## POINTER 3372
Don't vacillate. Don't overthink...<PAGE>Only people who strive to live in the moment 
can find the answer to that question.

## POINTER 3373
If there's somebody in this world who has 
a task they absolutely must accomplish...<PAGE>I'd like to be that somebody.

## POINTER 3374
Don't you think people like 
that are admirable?<PAGE>They might not have the power to change 
the world, but admirable they are.

## POINTER 3375
The last blessing you will receive in this 
world is the knowing of your purpose.<PAGE>And, of course, the fulfillment 
of that purpose.

## POINTER 3376
Just begin with 
something you know 
you can do.<PAGE>The first thing one 
must do is begin.

## POINTER 3377
Just like I said, eh?<PAGE>Nobody's becoming a noble here.

## POINTER 3378
I think working is useless.

## POINTER 3379
If I'm not going to become 
a noble...what's the point?<PAGE>I'm just going to do what I want.

## POINTER 3380
*Sigh*
What is so fun about
working tirelessly...?

## POINTER 3381
Why should I have to do the things 
someone else will do for me?<PAGE>They call people like 
that "suckers".

## POINTER 3382
I'd rather be a slacker 
than a sucker, you know.

## POINTER 3383
It's not as if there any many truly 
important things in this world...<PAGE>In any case, the truly important things 
get handled by the people who are 
supposed to take care of them.

## POINTER 3384
I'm not making excuses for slacking off.<PAGE>That's just life...it's 
the way the world works.

## POINTER 3385
Throughout history, there have always 
been two types of people.<PAGE>That's right. The rulers, 
and the ruled.

## POINTER 3386
Everyone working in this town,
without exception, are among the latter.

## POINTER 3387
What was that sound...?
I'm curious...<PAGE>I'm curious, but until the end of my shift,
I can't leave here...

## POINTER 3388
To protect what needs to be protected.
That is the job of a Knight...<PAGE>But I'm anxious about
that explosion I heard...

## POINTER 3389
The high-and-mighties sure didn't 
waste much time running off!

## POINTER 3390
It's always the downtrodden that get 
forced to do the dirty work...

## POINTER 3391
Where was Heliord's fancy ruler 
when his town was in crisis?

## POINTER 3392
Authorities are never there when it matters, 
and don't make a difference even if they are.<PAGE>Even worse, they always butt their 
heads in when they're least wanted.

## POINTER 3393
The only person you can rely 
on in a crisis is yourself!

## POINTER 3394
I'm not foolish enough to leave my fate 
in the hands of an inept leader.

## POINTER 3395
Putting up with my superior's 
unreasonable demands, cleaning up 
incompetent underlings' messes...<PAGE>I'm tired of it...

## POINTER 3396
I'm completely exhausted from staying 
up working night after night!<PAGE>Is this really what a knight 
is supposed to be doing?!

## POINTER 3397
Effort always bears fruit. Persevering until you 
harvest that fruit is the definition of effort!<PAGE>People put faith in notions like that, 
and then die in obscurity...

## POINTER 3398
Nobles are winners, commoners 
are losers. Everything 
is decided by birth!

## POINTER 3399
What was that?! 
That shake just now!
