*Yawn*...Getting sleepy...

## POINTER 5201
*Snore*... Sir!<PAGE>I've mastered the art of sleeping standing up!

## POINTER 5202
*Snore*...

## POINTER 5203
It's been pretty rough around here lately, 
you'd all best run along home now.

## POINTER 5204
I'm sure your mommy's worried sick.

## POINTER 5205
My best friend moved 
away to a town 
called Heliord.<PAGE>Mama says it's a new town 
the Umpire just builded.

## POINTER 5206
We were writing letters back and 
forth, and then the letters stopped 
coming. I wonder why that is...

## POINTER 5207
What do you think the new town 
the Umpire builded is like?

## POINTER 5208
My best friend in Heliord finally 
sent me a reply. She said there 
was a big problem there.

## POINTER 5209
This man named Don had to go away forever. 
The grown-ups were all running around 
talking about it. I'm okay, though.

## POINTER 5210
How can you be a good grown-up if you 
get sad about every little thing?

## POINTER 5211
All the grown-ups are saying that something 
bad happened in the capital. I'm 
not too worried about it, though.

## POINTER 5212
How can you be a good grown-up if 
you worry about every little thing?

## POINTER 5213
All the grown-ups said really loud that 
something came out of the ocean. But 
that won't do anything bad to us.

## POINTER 5214
How can you be a good grown-up if 
you yell about every little thing?

## POINTER 5215
The grown-ups are scared and they 
said that's a big monster in the sky. 
I'm a little bit scared, too.

## POINTER 5216
Do you think somebody will make 
that bad monster go away?

## POINTER 5217
There's nothing quite like being lulled 
to sleep by the whispering of the waves.

## POINTER 5218
It's one of the true joys of travel.

## POINTER 5219
When the sun breaks over the 
horizon, tomorrow picks up 
where today leaves off.

## POINTER 5220
I wonder how the gang back at Dahngrest 
will fare without the Don around.

## POINTER 5221
I heard that the Knights 
are on fire trying ta 
get some ships ready.

## POINTER 5222
Can they be thinking of trying to board that 
building that surfaced out in the ocean?

## POINTER 5223
Back in my day, any man who 
called himself a sailor had 
some real gumption in 'im.<PAGE>They don't make 'em like that 
anymore, I'll tell you what!

## POINTER 5224
Maybe I'm gonna hafta stage a comeback 
here pretty soon; show these whippersnappers 
how it's done!

## POINTER 5225
Men are born ta live 
on the sea! And 
ta die on it!

## POINTER 5226
The sea's a damn good thing!

## POINTER 5227
I was proud as could be, the day 
the Don took a ride in my boat.

## POINTER 5228
You rest in peace 
out there, Don.

## POINTER 5229
I got word somethin' big 
went down on Ilyccia.

## POINTER 5230
I don't know much about what happens across the 
water, though. I'm too busy tryin' ta figure 
out what's goin' on in front of my own eyes.

## POINTER 5231
Some knights came lookin' 
ta hire a few top-notch 
sailors. Hmm...

## POINTER 5232
If it's top-notch they need, why 
didn't they come talkin' ta me?

## POINTER 5233
Not even I can steer 
a ship inta the sky.

## POINTER 5234
I suppose I'll let the youngsters 
take a crack at that beast.

## POINTER 5235
Hoh hoh hoh. Aren't the ships just 
grand? Board a boat and you can 
see the world, I always say.<PAGE>The thrill! The mystery! 
The spectacle of it all!

## POINTER 5236
Don't you have a ship of your own? 
My, well that just won't do.

## POINTER 5237
Hoh hoh hoh. Aren't ships just 
grand? Board a boat and you can 
see the world, I always say.<PAGE>Miracles! Wonders waiting just 
over the edge of every horizon!

## POINTER 5238
Hoh hoh hoh. Aren't ships just 
grand? Board a boat and you can 
see the world, I always say.<PAGE>All the risks, and 
oh, the rewards!

## POINTER 5239
Hoh hoh hoh. Aren't ships just 
grand? Board a boat and you 
can see the world, I always 
say. Bread! Cakes! You can 
eat it all, on a boat!

## POINTER 5240
Hoh hoh hoh. Aren't ships just 
grand? Board a boat and you 
can see the world, I always 
say. You can come along! 
And you! And you too!

## POINTER 5241
Hoh hoh hoh. Aren't ships just 
grand? Board a boat and you 
can see the world, I always 
say. A sail on the ocean 
blue! For me and for you!

## POINTER 5242
Hoh hoh hoh. Aren't ships just 
grand? Board a boat and you 
can see the world, I always 
say. Monsters! Buildings! 
It's all part of the deal!

## POINTER 5243
I heard that the Knights have 
been in a big hurry getting 
ships together.

## POINTER 5244
The murmuring tides stir up 
thoughts of loves I've known. <PAGE>Oh, Larry. 
I wonder just what you 
might be thinking now.

## POINTER 5245
Oh, Larry. I wonder 
just what you might 
be thinking now.

## POINTER 5246
What could my sweet 
heart be up to now? <PAGE>Ah, how my mind 
wanders to you 
at night...

## POINTER 5247
My love and I promised 
ourselves to one another 
in front of the lighthouse. <PAGE>We swore we'd return 
to one another, even 
if we were separated.

## POINTER 5248
We swore we'd return to one another, 
even if we were separated.

## POINTER 5249
Love lost so long ago, still yet to return...But 
his thoughts come floating on the sea 
breeze, returning to the port today. <PAGE>Ah the sea breeze 
embraces me!

## POINTER 5250
I wonder where you might be now, 
and what you're doing there.

## POINTER 5251
I can't help thinking of our times together, 
Larry, when I gaze out at the sea.

## POINTER 5252
I’m sure you’re thinking 
of me, way across 
the sea. <PAGE>Yes, I’m sure you are.

## POINTER 5253
Come to me on swift wings! 
Save me from the horrors 
besetting the world! <PAGE>Hey, he will come won’t he...? 
Of course he will!

## POINTER 5254
If you travel to the south from the port by boat, the 
continent of Desier will appear on your right. You'll 
also be able to see Hypionia off to the left.<PAGE>There's a city with a coliseum 
on Desier. That's something 
I'd like to go and see...

## POINTER 5255
The coliseum: your blood singing with excitement, 
a parade of flesh dancing before your eyes... I'd 
love to see it all for myself, even just once.

## POINTER 5256
A guild called Palestralle 
manages things at 
the coliseum.

## POINTER 5257
Don't you think it's sort of awesome 
that there's a guild that specializes 
in running a coliseum?

## POINTER 5258
When it's nighttime here, it must 
be night at the coliseum, too.

## POINTER 5259
At least the coliseum and I both exist 
underneath the same big sky.

## POINTER 5260
*Sigh* 
I want to go to the coliseum so much...<PAGE>If only I could, 
I would swim the 
sea to get there...

## POINTER 5261
I couldn't swim 10 feet if my life depended on it, though.

## POINTER 5262
The world is ever-changing. Perhaps 
the light house will illuminate 
my way forward today as well.

## POINTER 5263
I swear, something about the nighttime 
brings out the poet in me.

## POINTER 5264
See the barrier blastia there? 
There's another one just like 
it over in Nor Harbor.<PAGE>Of course, these two were once part 
of a set of three, with the third being 
out on the ocean in Capua Duo.

## POINTER 5265
It's on account of that barrier 
blastia that our lives are comfortable 
and free from worry.

## POINTER 5266
No matter what might happen, the 
barrier's sure to protect us.

## POINTER 5267
It's on account of the barrier 
blastia that our lives are comfortable 
and free from worry.

## POINTER 5268
No matter what might happen, 
the barrier's sure to 
protect us. I hope...

## POINTER 5269
Quite a few of us here bid farewell 
to the men who rowed out 
to sea in the boats...<PAGE>Not a single one of them has been 
heard from since, though...

## POINTER 5270
Hmph... They've all found some 
pretty young girl in another town 
by now, I'm sure of it...!

## POINTER 5271
The Don, now there was an honest to goodness man.

## POINTER 5272
It's always the good ones that 
have to go first, while the dirtbags 
seem to live forever.

## POINTER 5273
Seems like this whole world 
is primed and ready to go 
up like a powder keg.

## POINTER 5274
I doubt there'll ever be another 
one quite like him.

## POINTER 5275
I'd have been better off kicking the bucket 
a ways back if I knew a monster like 
this was gonna show up in the sky.

## POINTER 5276
I wonder if we're really even safe inside the town.

## POINTER 5277
Good evening. It will be 300 Gald 
if you'd like to stay the night. 
Will you be staying with us?

## POINTER 5278
Thank you very much. Take 
care, and have a nice day.

## POINTER 5279
Why bother with those clumsy boys around the way when 
you could spend some time with the genuine article?

## POINTER 5280
Men these days just have no fight in them, and they're 
boring to boot. It's enough to drive a girl crazy.

## POINTER 5281
We humans are all gonna die someday. 
The Don, me, and you too, sweetie.

## POINTER 5282
When you're down in the dumps, the only 
thing to do is party the blues away. 
Come on, why not take a walk with me?

## POINTER 5283
Oh, and here I was gonna show 
you such a good time.

## POINTER 5284
I thought the Commandant was 
just the Empire's dog... <PAGE>But he really 
proved his worth 
in the rebellion!

## POINTER 5285
Hey, what do you say? Wanna 
have a little fun?

## POINTER 5286
If we're fated to die no matter what we do, there's nothing 
for it but to enjoy life right down to the last breath.

## POINTER 5287
I got myself good and lost in some ruins while 
I was wandering around in the woods.<PAGE>And that's where I heard this 
monster howling. Most bone-chilling 
thing you ever heard.

## POINTER 5288
I'll bet my life that it was none other 
than the legendary creature, Uma.

## POINTER 5289
Nobody much wants to believe that 
this Uma creature exists, though.

## POINTER 5290
There are still monsters<PAGE>in this world even the Hunting Blades<PAGE>don't know about.<PAGE>Euma is one of them!

## POINTER 5291
And the Uma's a prime example!

## POINTER 5292
That's it! It's the 
legendary Uma!

## POINTER 5293
Did you see it, huh?! That'll 
show all you naysayers who 
said it wasn't real!

## POINTER 5294
Verily...... 
Hmm.... 
Is that really a Euma......?<PAGE>Are there really such 
things as Eumas...?

## POINTER 5295
Hey there handsome, wouldn't 
you like to hold hands 
with my sisters and I?<PAGE>You're sorely mistaken if you 
think we're just your average 
girls next door, though.∀

## POINTER 5296
There's plenty of monsters left in 
this world that not even the Hunting 
Blades know a thing about.

## POINTER 5297
Dag nabbit!! That granddaughter of 
mine's done it again! This time she 
took my ship and went out to sea!<PAGE>And as a bonus, she even 
blew up the engine! This 
is the last straw.

## POINTER 5298
What did I ever do to deserve 
a granddaughter who's so obsessed 
with the ocean...?!

## POINTER 5299
Everybody knows the sea's not a force to 
be trifled with, but try telling that 
to my dunder brain of a granddaughter.
