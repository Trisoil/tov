## POINTER 1100
I may have no interest in 
peoples' squabbles, but the 
death of the Don is heavy...

## POINTER 1101
Maybe I'll go out hunt to 
take my mind off things.

## POINTER 1102
They say something 
happened in Zaphias, but it 
has nothing to do with me.

## POINTER 1103
I guess I'll go fulfill the duty 
of the Hunting Blades.

## POINTER 1104
The monsters are restless. 
I wonder if it's because of 
the monster in the sky?

## POINTER 1105
Sky, land, whatever. 
I'll take on all the 
vicious monsters.

## POINTER 1106
I'm glad the Don can keep this 
place lively, but I wish we'd just 
go take out the Empire already.

## POINTER 1107
Surely Barbos will 
stand against them...

## POINTER 1108
What a great chance 
to show the world 
what a guild can do!

## POINTER 1109
If we take care of this before the 
Don gets his chance to show off, 
everyone will know our strength!

## POINTER 1110
Damn the Don
and his antics!

## POINTER 1111
At this rate we could even 
take on the Empire...

## POINTER 1112
Now we can finally take on those 
idiots from the Empire. We'll 
show them a thing or two.

## POINTER 1113
Damn it! What do guildsmen
think they're doing fighting 
against each other?!

## POINTER 1114
The Empire is the enemy!

## POINTER 1115
Heh, so the mighty Don
passes away... I won't get 
my share of excitement.

## POINTER 1116
The Don's weak. 
Now Dahngrest's 
gonna get boring.

## POINTER 1117
Who the hell would 
support a treaty 
with the Empire?

## POINTER 1118
The Don is weak.

## POINTER 1119
If Barbos were still alive, 
he'd take that thing down 
before you could blink.

## POINTER 1120
What the hell does the 
Don think he's doing?

## POINTER 1121
I hear Palestralle has 
made their move.

## POINTER 1122
Heh...things are going 
to get interesting.

## POINTER 1123
All right, now things 
get interesting.<PAGE>How's the Don
gonna finish this?

## POINTER 1124
I haven't been this 
excited in a while! 
I'm gonna enjoy this!

## POINTER 1125
I hate the way the 
Don does things. 
This ain't right.

## POINTER 1126
Damn it! 
Why are all the 
strong men dying?

## POINTER 1127
If the Empire tries to muscle in,
there's no way the Union as it 
is now can stand up to them.

## POINTER 1128
I wonder how long 
Dahngrest will hold...

## POINTER 1129
It's times like this I wish 
the Don and Barbos
were still with us...

## POINTER 1130
Hey! Whaddaya think you're 
doin' just wanderin' around?

## POINTER 1131
Well?! You got a 
problem, buddy?!

## POINTER 1132
Th-the barrier broke?! 
That's impossible!! 
Is the Empire behind this?!

## POINTER 1133
Yo, buddy! 
You sure you ain't an 
Empire spy? Huh?!

## POINTER 1134
The Blood Alliance
should just take over 
the Union already.

## POINTER 1135
And then beat the living 
crap out of the Empire!

## POINTER 1136
A treaty of friendship? 
Are you crazy?

## POINTER 1137
Ain't nobody getting 
friendly with the Empire.

## POINTER 1138
I'm tough, but that 
thing scares even me.

## POINTER 1139
Not that it would
beat me in a fight,
mind you.

## POINTER 1140
Is it true Belius died?<PAGE>Not that I care 
much either way.

## POINTER 1141
Hey, I've got my 
hands full taking 
care of myself!

## POINTER 1142
All this commotion... 
What a pain...<PAGE>What, can he go and do 
anything he wants, just 
'cause he is Don?

## POINTER 1143
Prepared to die? Hah! 
That's ridiculous. Like 
anyone could do that...

## POINTER 1144
The Don is dead. 
Hah hah... I get it. 
I'm dreaming...

## POINTER 1145
I just don't know...

## POINTER 1146
Come on, give me a break... 
This is just crazy.

## POINTER 1147
If nothing else, we gotta 
protect Dahngrest.

## POINTER 1148
Be careful. 
The brighter the light, 
the darker the shadows.

## POINTER 1149
Don't go walking into any alleys. 
Don't whine if you get yourself 
killed... That's Dahngrest.

## POINTER 1150
Well, well. 
It's nice the guild
folks all fired up.

## POINTER 1151
Monsters aren't my style. 
People are.

## POINTER 1152
We take the barriers for granted, 
but when you think about it 
they're pretty incredible.

## POINTER 1153
They're so much a part of 
our lives that nobody thinks 
too hard about them, but...

## POINTER 1154
Human marks. 
That's where we come in.

## POINTER 1155
The Don, or Barbos. 
Wonder who I should 
work for...?

## POINTER 1156
It doesn't really matter, 
as long as I get paid.

## POINTER 1157
If only I could kill Ragou
with my own hands.

## POINTER 1158
You'd be surprised how many folks 
there are that some people wouldn't 
mind seeing disappear...

## POINTER 1159
You say that Ragou's 
as good as free?<PAGE>I swear, everyone and 
everything is rotten. 
...I bet you are too.

## POINTER 1160
Right now, the only people 
innocent enough to face the 
heavens are small children.

## POINTER 1161
Those monsters are divine 
punishment to humans 
for the reckless behavior.<PAGE>It's too late to 
regret it now.

## POINTER 1162
Now, for good people 
like me, it's time to 
get out of here.

## POINTER 1163
I heard Ragou
turned up dead.<PAGE>The Union put a bounty 
on him, but I guess 
someone got to him first.

## POINTER 1164
Karma makes the world 
go 'round, I guess.

## POINTER 1165
Things are bad...<PAGE>But this is my chance 
to make some money...

## POINTER 1166
But I have no obligations 
to the Union.<PAGE>Mercenaries will fight for 
whoever pays us best.

## POINTER 1167
Hey, what's going on? 
What's everyone doing here?<PAGE>A battle with 
Palestralle could start 
any minute, you know.

## POINTER 1168
If you keep just hanging 
around, their people are 
gonna take the town!

## POINTER 1169
In the end, the Don was 
just another person.<PAGE>He was not superhuman. 
He was not immortal.

## POINTER 1170
There was no 
one who could kill 
that old man after all.<PAGE>The only one who 
could kill the Don was 
the Don himself.

## POINTER 1171
I wonder who ended 
up killing Ragou?<PAGE>He was mine. I should 
kill whoever it was 
that took my prize.

## POINTER 1172
Ragou only got what 
was coming to him
sooner or later.

## POINTER 1173
I have no idea what 
can be done to defeat 
the evil in this world.

## POINTER 1174
There's no clear 
line between what's 
good and what's evil.

## POINTER 1175
I don't know what 
the line is between 
good and evil.<PAGE>But destroying the world 
crosses way over that line.

## POINTER 1176
Are you ready 
to take a stand 
against evil?

## POINTER 1177
I came here with my 
husband, but I had no idea 
this was such a large town.

## POINTER 1178
This place really 
has a different energy 
than Zaphias.

## POINTER 1179
Wh-what are the Knights doing? 
Th-they told us to run, but 
where are we supposed to go?

## POINTER 1180
Grrr! 
Where has my idiot of a 
husband run off to?

## POINTER 1181
That really was something! 
What a city! The citizens 
defend it all by themselves.

## POINTER 1182
And that man, the one 
they call "the Don"... 
Wow...

## POINTER 1183
Wh-what do we do? We'll 
be in danger if they 
find out we're nobles!

## POINTER 1184
A-are we going to be okay? 
They'll beat us up if they 
find out we're nobles!

## POINTER 1185
I'm so glad the 
misunderstanding 
has been cleared up...<PAGE>Now they won't 
beat us up.

## POINTER 1186
I thought I would 
be worth more dead 
than alive.

## POINTER 1187
Things have finally quieted 
down here... Unlike Zaphias, this 
is quite a down-and-dirty town.

## POINTER 1188
It can be tiring staying 
in an unfamilar place.

## POINTER 1189
What is that?! What's 
going on in this city?!

## POINTER 1190
The people here 
are nervous. 
What is it now?<PAGE>There's just no end to 
the chaos in this town.

## POINTER 1191
At least Zaphias
is calm and quiet.

## POINTER 1192
A lot of people are gathered 
in the town's main street...<PAGE>Isn't that the Don
sitting in the middle?

## POINTER 1193
Why is the Don sitting in 
the middle of the street...?<PAGE>Something's about 
to go down...

## POINTER 1194
Now everyone's 
strangely quiet... 
I wonder what happened...

## POINTER 1195
It's just one thing after 
another in this town.

## POINTER 1196
Oh my... Are things all 
right back in Zaphias?

## POINTER 1197
My son and his wife 
are still there...

## POINTER 1198
My son and his wife are still in 
the capital... I said I wanted to 
go home, but my husband said no. <PAGE>I know it's dangerous, 
but still...

## POINTER 1199
What's become of 
our Zaphias...?
