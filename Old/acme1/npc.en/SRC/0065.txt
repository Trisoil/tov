## POINTER 6500
Man, this world 
is in bad shape. <PAGE>I guess you're up to 
your necks in it, 
yourselves, huh, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 6501
Well, I'm not too worried if 
you all are taking care of stuff. <PAGE>All of us will just be 
here waiting for you and 
<STR>(FRE) to come home.

## POINTER 6502
Heeeey there pretty lady! 
How about you and me crack open a 
bottle or ten and have us a night? <PAGE>...Hey, you're a guy?!

## POINTER 6503
Come on. A guy sitting 
next to me ain't helping 
my chances. Beat it.

## POINTER 6504
Hey! 
I heard about you! <PAGE>You got caught by the 
knights, right? 
I can't believe you're out.

## POINTER 6505
So let me guess. 
They gave you stew, right? <PAGE>Choke down some stew, then puke 
it back up for the next guy, right? 
Hah hah hah hah!

## POINTER 6506
Those two at that table over 
there are always talking about 
serious stuff over their drinks. <PAGE>Come on, guys! Drinking's 
supposed to be fun!

## POINTER 6507
You can still have fun 
*hic* drinking alone, 
right?<PAGE>Shut up nobody's talkin' 
to you go away stop 
botherin' me... *hic*

## POINTER 6508
Sometimes a man 
just can't go home...

## POINTER 6509
I'm waitin' for all the 
hullabaloo to calm down. <PAGE>So don't go thinking I got 
kicked out. It's not that. 
Nope.

## POINTER 6510
The largest mercenary guild
is the Blood Alliance. <PAGE>They can be a little rough, 
but they get the job done.

## POINTER 6511
There are actually quite 
a few mercenary guilds. <PAGE>It's kind of hard to 
figure out which guild
to request a job from.

## POINTER 6512
The capital is truly amazing. 
It's thriving! It's better 
than any city I've seen.

## POINTER 6513
The lower quarter here is 
outside the castle walls. 
I wonder if that's because it's new. <PAGE>It's pretty scary being this 
close to the edge of the barrier.

## POINTER 6514
There are more guilds
in this world than there 
are stars in the sky. <PAGE>I don't think the 
Guild Union even knows 
how many there are.

## POINTER 6515
Actually, I'm also associated 
with a guild: Strollers' Map. <PAGE>It's mainly involved in 
writing and publishing 
stories about travel.

## POINTER 6516
You should try going 
to Tolbyccia first. <PAGE>It's best to start off 
with a continent that 
has already been mapped.

## POINTER 6517
Even you, Yuri! We all joined together. 
It's me. Me! 
You must remember...

## POINTER 6518
The three of us used to play cards 
all the time on our days off.<PAGE>That was about the only thing 
I could beat the two of you at...

## POINTER 6519
You really don't know who I am? 
It's me, I tell you. Me!

## POINTER 6520
We have to make on our ultimate decision. <PAGE>Should we stay or go? Get killed 
by the monters outside, or 
cooperate with those underground?

## POINTER 6521
If you don't want to be eaten 
alive, do you want to be crawling 
around on the ground? Hah hah hah. <PAGE>Okay, I've decided. When 
the time comes, I'll go 
underground. Let's dive!

## POINTER 6522
I can't! I can't! 
I can't continue to live 
in terror every day.

## POINTER 6523
Heaven is hell and this 
world is hell. If I could 
only have one, I'd pick...

## POINTER 6524
The monsters were cleared out of 
the city, but they're hiding in 
the darkness of the night... <PAGE>We can't let our guard down. 
We have to be ready.

## POINTER 6525
The people down below are in more 
trouble. The tangled buildings 
leave a lot of blind spots. <PAGE>Anyways, at least the 
barrier was restored.

## POINTER 6526
Please. 
Let me rest... <PAGE>Can you at least keep it down 
in the mansion at night? 
You're all awake for no reason.

## POINTER 6527
The fatigue from 
the mental anguish 
is overwhelming...

## POINTER 6528
When the darkness of the night 
is scary, look to the sky. The 
starry sky will bring you peace...

## POINTER 6529
Oh, it's cloudly tonight. 
Well, I guess there are 
nights like this, too...

## POINTER 6530
This is it!
The fun night shift!<PAGE>The Twelve Spears of the <STR>(FRE) Brigade get a special bonus
from Sir <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 6531
What are the Twelve Spears?
Umm... I don't feel
like explaining it.

## POINTER 6532
There's not much point 
fretting over what may or 
may not happen tomorrow. <PAGE>And we should be thankful for 
the gifts that each new day 
brings, whatever they may be.

## POINTER 6533
Depending on our attitudes, 
it's even possible to see 
sunshine on a rainy day.

## POINTER 6534
The Tree of Halure
is mighty indeed. <PAGE>But it cannot solve 
my problems for me.

## POINTER 6535
We must seek the answers 
to the questions we have 
on our own.<PAGE>Wouldn't you agree?

## POINTER 6536
*Meow ♪*

## POINTER 6537
*Woof?*

## POINTER 6538
I barely escaped 
with my life! <PAGE>I thought I was 
going to die!

## POINTER 6539
I plan on going to 
Nor Harbor for refuge, but 
what about after that? <PAGE>I guess I could cross the ocean to 
Heliord, the city for nobles... 
Yeah, I think I'll go there.

## POINTER 6540
I'm gonna build 
every single house 
in this whole town!

## POINTER 6541
Night or day, 
my craftsman's soul 
will be going full on!

## POINTER 6542
*Woofff...Wff*

## POINTER 6543
*Meow∀*

## POINTER 6544
*Meow?*

## POINTER 6545
Now we can relax and walk 
around town, even at night. 
It's all thanks to the Knights.<PAGE>And you guys, too. 
You're the ones who 
chased Cumore off, after all.

## POINTER 6546
My mom and dad still bug 
us about staying up late. 
I guess nothing's perfect.

## POINTER 6547
You can still see 
that thing in the sky 
 at night...<PAGE>And I'm still scared.... 
But I still look.

## POINTER 6548
I really want to go home... 
But I'll stay a little longer, 
just a little bit longer.

## POINTER 6549
...If you don't shut up, 
I'll throw you in the slammer.

## POINTER 6550
If you insist on approaching the mansion 
at this hour, we'll have to arrest 
you on suspicion of burglary.<PAGE>You'll keep away if you 
know what's good for you.

## POINTER 6551
The assistant magistrate that left for 
Zaphias yesterday has not returned. <PAGE>He was supposed 
to bring the payroll 
with him.

## POINTER 6552
If we don't receive payment, 
then all the work we've done 
here has been meaningless...

## POINTER 6553
There's no way I can 
let you in during the 
middle of the night.

## POINTER 6554
I never knew working without 
pay would be so meaningless.<PAGE>If they don't pay me 
what they promised... 
I hate this...

## POINTER 6555
Then again, I've been hearing rumors 
that money's not even gonna have 
any value before too long...

## POINTER 6556
There was a landslide 
on the north part 
of the continent?

## POINTER 6557
What I care about is the money we're owed...

## POINTER 6558
I wonder what that 
tower-mountain-city-thing is... <PAGE>Do you know what 
I'm talking about?

## POINTER 6559
I wonder who's living there. Do you 
think it would be okay if we went?

## POINTER 6560
Even though the world's in a state of 
panic, when night falls, I still get 
sleepy... I can't seem to help it.<PAGE>Zzz...

## POINTER 6561
Zzz... 
...*Mumble, mumble.*

## POINTER 6562
The light house shines 
brighter and stronger 
than any star!<PAGE>It makes us feel safe, even in 
the dead of night, just like the 
protection of a loving father.

## POINTER 6563
I swear, something about the 
night brings out the poet in me.

## POINTER 6564
The soothing sound 
of the waves takes away 
all the stress of the day...<PAGE>I just can't believe this 
could be the end of the world.

## POINTER 6565
As surely as day follows night, 
a new world will be born from 
the death of the old...at least I hope so...

## POINTER 6566
We have the authority to 
detain anyone displaying 
suspicious activity.<PAGE>It's all to prevent further 
confusion in this city.

## POINTER 6567
I don't want to have to take any hard measures. 
I'm hoping everyone will be cooperative.

## POINTER 6568
You lot there... You're not 
Hunting Blades, are you?<PAGE>You'd better not be, or you'd face
immediate arrest and judgment.

## POINTER 6569
If you're not, all is well.<PAGE>We're not interested in 
harassing the citizenry 
with baseless arrests.

## POINTER 6570
Oh, maybe it's 'cause I got rid of my beard.<PAGE>...No, I guess that's probably 
got nothing to do with it.

## POINTER 6571
You still don't recognize me?

## POINTER 6572
Hey, want to hear my 
impression of Sir Adecor?<PAGE>Halt, I say! 
You won't, I say, won't get away with this! 
Pretty good, huh? I thought so.

## POINTER 6573
Have you totally 
forgotten about me?

## POINTER 6574
Lord Natz is using 
these chambers in his capacity as 
interim Duce.<PAGE>If you have business, 
you may enter.

## POINTER 6575
Soon enough these rooms 
will belong to Lord Natz, future Duce, 
current interim Duce.<PAGE>I'm sure he'll eventually be making 
use of Duce Belius's
private chamber itself...

## POINTER 6576
This is the counter 
for group applicants.<PAGE>We are not receiving 
applicants right now.

## POINTER 6577
We will start receiving 
from 9 am tomorrow.<PAGE>Get yourself a good nights sleep, 
then come again.

## POINTER 6578
Do you think you 
register in the 
middle of the night?

## POINTER 6579
I'm just the receptionist's assistant, 
my night job is as a miscreant!

## POINTER 6580
I'm just the receptionist's assistant, 
but if I had the chance I'd be a contestant!

## POINTER 6581
I'm just the receptionist's assistant, 
mind out for the dog, he's flatulent!

## POINTER 6582
I'm just the receptionist's assistant, 
these late night visits make me intolerant!

## POINTER 6583
I'm just the receptionist's assistant, 
but believe me I'm resistant, to the charms of all miscreants!!

## POINTER 6584
I'm just the receptionist's assistant, 
I'm sorry if I seem recalcitrant!

## POINTER 6585
I'm just the receptionist's assistant, 
and I don't mean to be intolerant, but if you don't leave on the instant, there's going to be an incident!

## POINTER 6586
Torim Harbor is east from the exit
on the other side.<PAGE>There's nothing but talk about
the relics that appeared
on the southern seas.

## POINTER 6587
I wish I would've 
high-tailed it out of here 
too when I had the chance...<PAGE>If I went for it on my own 
now, I'd get mauled by monsters. 
I totally blew my chances.

## POINTER 6588
Thankfully, that loud-mouth 
Cumore and the egomaniacal 
Alexei are gone for good.

## POINTER 6589
*Mew*

## POINTER 6590
I wonder if my little sister 
is all right? Saying it's 
pretty and all that...<PAGE>I just don't understand 
what these kids are 
thinking nowadays...

## POINTER 6591
And I'm just scared... 
I guess I'm still just a kid...

## POINTER 6592
Ohhhh man... There were 
sooooooo many monsters! 
Aaaaall over the place.<PAGE>I wonder if we'll have to 
evacuate like the capital. *Hic!*

## POINTER 6593
I bet this city's done for.<PAGE>I'll bet I'll have 
to go someplace 
else... *Hic!*

## POINTER 6594
I'm up to my eyeballs in 
research about how to 
confront that catastrophe.<PAGE>But I just can't seem 
to find any solution. 
Oh, what to do...

## POINTER 6595
If we can't find a solution in the 
past, we'll just have to create a 
new future by ourselves.<PAGE>Our own thoughts and experiences 
from us living right now can be 
more valuable than past records.

## POINTER 6596
The Knights are bad. All bad. 
I tell you, it's their fault that 
monster came out.<PAGE>I'm telling you, 
it's all their fault!

## POINTER 6597
The Knights are bad. All bad. 
I tell you, it's their fault the ships got 
wrecked and the storm hit the port.

## POINTER 6598
The Knights are bad. All bad. 
I tell you, it's their fault that 
tower came out.<PAGE>I'm telling you, it's all their fault!

## POINTER 6599
The Knights are bad. All bad. 
I tell you, it's their fault Belius 
died and tomatoes are red!
