## POINTER 2600
I've got it! I've got the 
formula! I did it!! ...Wha, 
who are you people?<PAGE>...What? Why is 
it so dark? Did 
something happen?

## POINTER 2601
Who the hell are you?! 
You try and swipe any 
blastia, I'll know!

## POINTER 2602
How? Well, we're the blastia administration 
department. Administering all the 
excavated blastia is our job.

## POINTER 2603
Hey, you people...you just let yourselves 
into the ruins, didn't you? We can't have 
that. Laypeople aren't allowed in there.

## POINTER 2604
You know, the rights to those ruins 
used to be ours...damn it all! Always 
getting beat out by Mordio...

## POINTER 2605
The blastia thief was caught, right? 
And Mordio's gone...now it's all down 
to the research results...heh heh!♪

## POINTER 2606
Now we just have to get the results 
together and announce them...

## POINTER 2607
The sky's looking strange?<PAGE>You can't even see the 
sky here. Who cares?

## POINTER 2608
It's dangerous? What 
are you saying?<PAGE>The blastia we're excavating are even 
more energized than usual. This 
is our chance at experimentation!

## POINTER 2609
They say we're going to have some Guild 
help out with excavation at the ruins...?

## POINTER 2610
"Ruins' Gate", or something...they'll 
just get in 
the way...

## POINTER 2611
Did something happen 
on Ehmead Hill?<PAGE>One of my colleagues went there 
with several other people...

## POINTER 2612
Now the Knights have 
come and taken several 
researchers with them.<PAGE>They took blastia, too, saying 
it was for the development 
of...Hera...? Hera-something.

## POINTER 2613
The Knights just do whatever they want. 
Our research is going to be delayed...and 
without <STR>(RIT) here, now's our chance!

## POINTER 2614
The sky above Zaphias is looking 
unusual, they say?<PAGE>Maybe something happened with 
their barrier blastia...

## POINTER 2615
If you want to talk to Tort, 
you have to bring a Krityan. <PAGE>Oh, you have one in your group, 
don't you? Why don't you have them 
come up here and talk to him?

## POINTER 2616
Who are you? 
I haven't seen you anywhere. <PAGE>Well, it doesn't matter though...

## POINTER 2617
You're not wearing blastia 
clothes... You must be an 
officer of the empire. <PAGE>You don't look like an officer at all.... 
Well, it doesn't matter though....

## POINTER 2618
It's pretty unusual for Mordio 
to work with other people.

## POINTER 2619
The Tree of Halure withering and 
blooming again is simply 
natural providence.

## POINTER 2620
The operating rate of our blastia has been 
very high lately. Aer control is going well, 
and research is proceeding smoothly.

## POINTER 2621
The abnormal environment in Zaphias 
right now...might it have something 
to do with an aer abnormality?

## POINTER 2622
Damn it all...thanks to all the 
earthquakes lately, our excavation 
site has been closed down.

## POINTER 2623
I know there's something just beyond... 
But there's nothing I can do about it now. 
I suppose I'll straighten out all the data....

## POINTER 2624
Hmm...? The stock list 
and number of blastia 
doesn't match...

## POINTER 2625
Just my mistake? 
I've been so forgetful 
lately...

## POINTER 2626
You people have 
Mordio with you? 
How unusual.

## POINTER 2627
Going off blastia-hunting again, eh?

## POINTER 2628
Without Mordio around, our research 
is going to fall behind.

## POINTER 2629
How soon will her business 
with you people end?<PAGE>I'd really like to have her 
help with research here...

## POINTER 2630
You, guys have something 
nice. It's a S P E C I A L Flag! <PAGE>Something special will 
happen if you use it.

## POINTER 2631
When I say special, 
I mean special. <PAGE>It is miracle. <PAGE>Well, you'll understand after reading 
the explanation and actually using it.

## POINTER 2632
Would you like a rest for 100 Gald? 
It's just a bookshelf, of course.

## POINTER 2633
Will you stay?

## POINTER 2634
Would you like a rest for 200 Gald? 
It's just a bookshelf, of course.

## POINTER 2635
We're all used to sleeping on bookcases, 
but it might be a little rough for 
first-timers. Do come again.

## POINTER 2636
The blastia excavated here 
were all made by the Kritya 
long, long ago.

## POINTER 2637
I'd love to be able to discuss 
blastia architecture with a 
Kritya engineer some day...

## POINTER 2638
Halure? Oh, the town with the barrier 
that serves as the best representative 
example of blastia with organic properties?<PAGE>What about it?

## POINTER 2639
I really never leave the town, 
so I'm not very well-informed.<PAGE>Not that I particularly want to be.

## POINTER 2640
You know, all the blastia we 
excavate here were physically 
buried by Kritya hands.<PAGE>What do you think it means?

## POINTER 2641
Please don't bother me right 
now. I'm thinking very 
hard about blastia.

## POINTER 2642
Why would they bury 
so many blastia...? 
Hmm... Hmmmm...<PAGE>...Because they couldn't 
be used anymore...?
...No, certainly not...

## POINTER 2643
They purposely stopped using such 
convenient things...things that 
make life so easy, right?

## POINTER 2644
Why? My calculations makes 
no sense! The recent 
data is so bizarre!!<PAGE>This data is important. 
It means something!!

## POINTER 2645
Incredible! These results completely 
explode the commonly accepted theories! 
Absolutely incredible!!

## POINTER 2646
Ruins... 
Must investigate ruins...<PAGE>Whoa! I dozed off there...

## POINTER 2647
I hear looters broke into 
the ruins to the southeast.<PAGE>They've already been 
thoroughly explored...I 
doubt there's anything left.

## POINTER 2648
If Halure's blastia evolves 
by adopting organic traits...<PAGE>Would it be possible to force evolution 
in humans through the use of blastia...?

## POINTER 2649
Would you mind not bothering me right 
now? I'm trying to think about the 
human bodies and organic traits.

## POINTER 2650
Your bodhi blastia has 
an interesting color. <PAGE>You must use your bodhi 
blastia quite a bit since 
it has grown so much.

## POINTER 2651
You guys...
You're the blastiaaaah.....<PAGE>...*Snore*...
Whoa! I fell asleep.... My night 
and day are all mixed up.

## POINTER 2652
Ahhh, ..... I am sleepy..... 
Ohhh, ..... I was asleep..... <PAGE>Is it still daytime? 
I can't tell if it's day or night 
since it is so dark outside...

## POINTER 2653
I've heard the skies over Zaphias are rather 
unusual. I'd like to go investigate...perhaps 
when my research comes to a stopping point.

## POINTER 2654
I think the recent earthquake 
exposed the blastia 
on the mountain. <PAGE>That earthquake is clearly 
the reason I can't sleep.

## POINTER 2655
No, wait. If you look at it a different 
way...maybe it's the blastia causing 
the earthquakes? That can't be...

## POINTER 2656
Many thanks! Fortune's Market, always 
bringing you what you need...when you 
need it...at the price that's right!

## POINTER 2657
...Or so I'd like to say, but 
the Empire's closed us down 
and there's no way in.<PAGE>*Sniff*

## POINTER 2658
...Or so I'd like to say, but with business 
ruined we aren't really able to stock 
a very wide variety of products...<PAGE>*Sniff*

## POINTER 2659
Our business is still in 
a shambles, you know...<PAGE>*Sniff*

## POINTER 2660
There have been so many earthquakes 
lately...do you think they're a precursor 
to something worse?

## POINTER 2661
At Ruins' Gate we specialize 
in excavation of ruins.<PAGE>It may seem humble, but we 
take pride in our work.

## POINTER 2662
Through excavation, we seek 
out our world's past.

## POINTER 2663
Yesterday digging, today more digging... 
It may not look it, but fooling 
around in the dirt is fun.<PAGE>Nothing in the world beats the 
feeling you get when you unearth 
an impressive artifact.

## POINTER 2664
We don't cry even if 
we run into worms!

## POINTER 2665
Have you gone there? To the 
south side slope on the hill 
in front of this town? <PAGE>It was blocked by a boulder 
and we moved it.

## POINTER 2666
Our job actually isn't 
just excavating ruins. <PAGE>The recovery of the south side slope on 
the hill was a real desire of the mages who 
travel between the capital and Aspio.

## POINTER 2667
The mountain collapsed from the 
impact on the capital and blocked 
the road to Shaikos. <PAGE>Then, it was 
our turn!

## POINTER 2668
Anyway, I wonder what 
that shock wave was? <PAGE>Well, that's OK. 
I am happy just 
swinging a pickax.

## POINTER 2669
There's something like a giant 
shadow on the sky itself...it 
seems so sinister.<PAGE>We're merely travelers moving 
from ruin to ruin, but it must 
be hard on the mages here.

## POINTER 2670
In any case...maybe we'll go excavating 
at the world's end. No, I don't 
mean we're running away!

## POINTER 2671
Our chief is very warm, 
and even treats underlings 
like us with kindness.<PAGE>He really is the model of 
a perfect Guild chief.

## POINTER 2672
The only flaw you might mention is the 
fact that he's somewhat cowardly...

## POINTER 2673
Our chief is named Regaey. He's 
a very mature individual.<PAGE>The reason we're considered one 
of the Five Master Guilds is 
all due to his achievements.

## POINTER 2674
If only he could be just 
a bit more brave...

## POINTER 2675
How many years has it been since Regaey 
assumed leadership of Ruins' Gate...?<PAGE>He may not look it, but he's very shrewd... 
He's so good at finding blastia, they used 
to say he worked with the hands of a god.

## POINTER 2676
Our chief doesn't actually like to 
make trips to ruins. He must not be 
very fond of all the monsters...

## POINTER 2677
I can't believe Lord Regaey was actually 
Yeager from Leviathan's Claw...<PAGE>No, I won't believe it! Yeager 
must have just been masquerading 
as Lord Regaey!

## POINTER 2678
But would that mean...we were just 
underlings for Leviathan's Claw...?

## POINTER 2679
Greetings. Is this your 
first time in Nordopolica, 
city of the coliseum?<PAGE>The coliseum is just up the 
stairs, to your north.∀

## POINTER 2680
If you'd like to leave 
town, just continue 
on to your left.<PAGE>I can't imagine anyone 
actually wanting to 
leave, of course.

## POINTER 2681
Good day, and welcome 
to Nordopolica!<PAGE>Are you here to participate in a tournament? 
Just spectators? The shopping here is 
really quite wonderful, you know!♪

## POINTER 2682
If you follow the road to the west, 
you'll arrive at a giant mountain. 
There's no way across it.<PAGE>Really, there's no point 
in leaving town at all.

## POINTER 2683
Good day. This 
is Nordopolica.<PAGE>Things seem to be unpleasant lately, 
but you can relax and make 
yourself feel at home here.

## POINTER 2684
Don't worry, we recaptured all 
the monsters that escaped.<PAGE>Please do go ahead 
and relax.

## POINTER 2685
Good day, and welcome 
to Nordopolica!♪ <PAGE>Exciting tournaments, great 
shopping, and fireworks 
when the weather is fine!

## POINTER 2686
*Sigh*...the Duce is 
dead, but I have to carry 
on like normal...<PAGE>What a sad fate for a 
town's poster girl...

## POINTER 2687
Welcome to the coliseum city!<PAGE>You're in luck! We're looking for 
combatants right now! Register at 
the counter inside the coliseum.

## POINTER 2688
Test your skill! Be the talk of the 
town! Be remembered! Come one, come 
all! How'd you like to participate?

## POINTER 2689
Welcome back to Nordopolica. There may 
be something awful and hideous in the 
sky, but we're cheerful as always!<PAGE>How'd you like to have a nice, 
pleasant stay in our town?

## POINTER 2690
I'm actually really scared. 
M-my knees are shaking...

## POINTER 2691
Welcome to Nordopolica, and 
thank you for your patronage.<PAGE>At times like these, 
just forget it all 
and have fun!

## POINTER 2692
The early bird gets the worm...and 
who knows how many worms are even 
left? Come along, come along!

## POINTER 2693
Let's go, 
let's go!

## POINTER 2694
Hey, mister. Wanna 
catch a fever 
with me?

## POINTER 2695
Thumpa-thump, 
thumpa-thump...

## POINTER 2696
People goin' crazy 
in the coliseum, I'm 
goin' crazy too!

## POINTER 2697

Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling...

## POINTER 2698
Come on and follow 
the winding road 
with me...

## POINTER 2699

Whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo...
