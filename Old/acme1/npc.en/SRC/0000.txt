<shop>

## POINTER 3
Welcome to the 
Fount of Warmth, 
Yumanju.

## POINTER 4
Please enjoy your stay.

## POINTER 5
Welcome to Yumanju's 
gift shop, Bubble Baubles. 
Please have a look around.

## POINTER 6
Thank you very much. 
We look forward 
to serving you again.

## POINTER 7
Ooh...I can't get enough 
of these hot springs. 
Ohh, they feel sooo gooood.

## POINTER 8
Isn't it nice to 
forget one's worldly 
cares and just relax?

## POINTER 9
This place is really wonderful. 
I didn't even know there were 
such things as open-air baths.

## POINTER 10
I never imagined getting 
a good soak in the great outdoors 
would feel so good.

## POINTER 11
Klink! Klank! Klank! Klink! 
Toss in a coin and 
out comes a drink!

## POINTER 12
What's gonna come out?♪ 
What's gonna come out?♪ 
Tra-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!♪

## POINTER 13
The water just keeps gushing 
out, and I can't swim! 
I'm going to drown...

## POINTER 14
There was a big bang, and 
the water just starting shooting 
out, and the fountain broke!<PAGE>I'm scared, <STR>(YUR)! 
Help us...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR), where were you? 
Everyone's been looking for you.

## POINTER 16
Is that girl your 
new friend? <PAGE>Are you playing hooky to 
go have fun with her? 
That's no good!

## POINTER 17
Oh, it's <STR>(YUR)
and <STR>(RAP)! <PAGE>You keep on making new 
friends. I'm so jealous!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RAP)!♪ 
I love your big ol' ears!∀

## POINTER 19
I heard <STR>(FRE)'s 
a captain now! <PAGE>Do captains live 
in the castle?

## POINTER 20
Is <STR>(FRE) never 
coming back to 
the lower quarter?<PAGE>I don't want him to be a 
captain if it means I never 
get to see <STR>(FRE) again...

## POINTER 21
I dropped my dentures 
and I can't find them... <PAGE>The water from the 
broken fountain must 
have washed them away.

## POINTER 22
Hmm? These? 
Oh, I borrowed my 
wife's dentures.

## POINTER 23
I eventually found my 
dentures, you know. <PAGE>But now we've 
lost my wife's...

## POINTER 24
You couldn't help me look 
for them, could you, sonny?

## POINTER 25
My wie ook my 
enturesh, ah ow 
I ah alk righ...

## POINTER 26
*Cough, cough*

## POINTER 27
I found the dentures! <PAGE>Now we can finally 
eat right.

## POINTER 28
You make sure you 
don't lose anything 
important too, sonny.

## POINTER 29
The sky is 
so strange. <PAGE>I've never seen it 
like this before...

## POINTER 30
I wonder if the same thing's 
happening in Deidon Hold and 
Halure. I hope they're all right...

## POINTER 31
It looks like the weirdness in the 
sky cleared up, but some houses in 
the lower quarter were damaged.<PAGE>The Knights won't do anything 
for us, so I guess we'll take 
care of things ourselves.

## POINTER 32
All we have to do with the 
debris is clear it away, but the 
main problem is the buildings. <PAGE>We just don't have enough 
able-bodied folk to work. If only 
the evacuees would return...

## POINTER 33
With the barriers down the 
monsters can get in, but are 
there really that many monsters?<PAGE>Even if there are, 
I'm sure the Knights 
will take care of them.

## POINTER 34
I hope the refugees that 
fled Zaphias are all right...

## POINTER 35
There was a rumbling from 
the north, like an earthquake. 
What could that have been?

## POINTER 36
Maybe a giant monster like 
the one in the sky erupted from 
the ground? I sure hope not...

## POINTER 37
Welcome! I want to help 
out too, but I have to keep 
the business running. <PAGE>This shop stays open, no 
matter what. Don't want to 
inconvenience people, you know!

## POINTER 38
Thanks! Come back 
any time. Like I said, 
we're always open.

## POINTER 39
The whole fountain mess 
seems to have calmed down. 
Now you're totally free to shop!

## POINTER 40
Hi! Wow, it's been a while! 
The Knights were chasing you, 
weren't they? Is everything okay?

## POINTER 41
We'll always be here 
to help you out.<PAGE>Stop by anytime.

## POINTER 42
Thanks! 
Come back whenever 
you're in Zaphias.

## POINTER 43
They say <STR>(FRE) is amazing! 
I almost want to hold a sale 
in his honor! ...Almost.

## POINTER 44
It was <STR>(FRE) that brought 
back the fountain blastia 
core, after all!<PAGE>Come on, <STR>(YUR)! 
You can't let him beat you!

## POINTER 45
What's going on...? Is the barrier 
blastia going weird? Yeah, 
we're always open for business.

## POINTER 46
The sky may be weird, but I'm not 
leaving Zaphias. As long as people 
live here, they'll need shops.

## POINTER 47
I can't keep my products 
arranged right, but look around 
and pick out what you need.

## POINTER 48
Sorry it's still such a mess. 
Don't let it put you off! 
Come back soon!

## POINTER 49
Things may be crazy, 
but you have to keep your cool. 
You should shop with a clear mind.

## POINTER 50
Thanks! Come 
back any time.

## POINTER 51
I hear <STR>(FRE)'s building a town 
somewhere. You should buy him 
something for all his hard work!

## POINTER 52
Thanks, buddy! 
If you see <STR>(FRE), 
give him my best.

## POINTER 53
The fountain blastia is 
broken... At this rate even 
the houses will be flooded!<PAGE>We have to stop the flow first. 
We'll think about pumping out 
the excess water later.

## POINTER 54
<STR>(YUR), don't just 
stand there! 
You help out too!

## POINTER 55
Well well, <STR>(YUR), the 
Knights certainly are 
fond of you.<PAGE>Leblanc and his troupe 
were just running around 
calling your name.

## POINTER 56
Be careful you don't do 
something to get <STR>(FRE)
chasing after you, too!

## POINTER 57
Hey, didn't you leave 
the city because the 
Knights were chasing you? <PAGE>What, did you forget something?

## POINTER 58
It'd be best if you 
didn't come back. 
You never know. <PAGE>Somebody could tell the 
Knights about you.

## POINTER 59
If it isn't the wanted 
man, <STR>(YUR)!♪<PAGE>You've got that big bounty 
on your head, maybe you 
want us to catch you?

## POINTER 60
Don't worry, <STR>(YUR). <PAGE>Turning you in for 
a reward wouldn't make 
me very happy.

## POINTER 61
Looks like the false 
charges got dropped.<PAGE>I always believed in you, <STR>(YUR).<PAGE>Really! I did!

## POINTER 62
Do what's right, even if the 
Knights are chasing you. 
That's you, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 63
The fountain blastia's been fixed!♪ 
It's all thanks to <STR>(FRE)
getting the core back.∀<PAGE><STR>(FRE)'s so popular. 
I hear there's even a 
<STR>(FRE) Defense Force.

## POINTER 64
The <STR>(FRE) Defense 
Force is really just 
a fan club. <PAGE>It sounded like fun, 
so I joined too!♪

## POINTER 65
To think the aque blastia 
had just been repaired! 
They must've done a shoddy job. <PAGE>I even used money I'd
saved for my wedding 
to get it fixed...

## POINTER 66
Well, whining isn't going to stop 
all this water. We have to do 
something about the fountain. <PAGE>I'd never forgive 
myself if I let my 
girl drown.

## POINTER 67
Well, the water stopped, but 
now we can't use the fountain. 
Sooner or later the water will run out. <PAGE>We better start 
thinking about other 
ways to get water.

## POINTER 68
I used the money I got 
back from the shoddy repair to 
find new sources of water.<PAGE>My wedding? Nah, we just put it 
off for a little. She'll wait for me. 
But thanks, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 69
The lower quarter's the same 
as always. The fountain 
blastia is still broken.<PAGE>There's no point in getting 
worked up about it. 
We'll fix it in good time.

## POINTER 70
That blastia breaking was bad, 
but it brought the people of 
the lower quarter together.<PAGE>Even my girl says 
she's counting on me... 
Heh heh.

## POINTER 71
Wow, <STR>(FRE)'s amazing! 
You hear he made captain?<PAGE>It's thanks to him our fountain's 
back in shape, too. He's the 
pride of the lower quarter.

## POINTER 72
<STR>(FRE)'s promotion to 
captain makes me as 
happy as if it were myself.

## POINTER 73
What's that thing 
in the sky that looks 
like an aurora? <PAGE>Ever since it appeared, the 
sky's been so strange...

## POINTER 74
What, now the barrier blastia's 
broken? At least the monsters 
haven't invaded yet.<PAGE>We have to protect this 
city. The lower quarter 
is my only home.

## POINTER 75
This is like the 
devastation after a 
giant storm, or something. <PAGE>When things are this bad, 
even getting depressed 
about it feels stupid.

## POINTER 76
No point in getting all weepy. 
We've got to work 
together and rebuild.<PAGE>If we can get the lower quarter
back in shape, maybe everyone 
who left will come back.

## POINTER 77
The refugees started coming 
back after things got back 
to normal in Zaphias.<PAGE>Of course, that was right when 
the monsters showed up and the 
barrier broke... What a life!

## POINTER 78
What's become of 
our Zaphias?

## POINTER 79
<STR>(FRE) took everyone 
to a town with a new barrier. <PAGE>What are you going 
to do, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 80
They have a barrier, so it's 
safer there. But I don't want 
to leave the lower quarter.<PAGE>I'm going to stay in the 
lower quarter to the bitter end.

## POINTER 81
All water for the lower quarter
came through that aque blastia... 
Now the pumps in our homes are dry.<PAGE>I don't really understand it, 
but my husband says the broken 
fountain is the reason.

## POINTER 82
I'm worried about water in the 
lower quarter. We can't cook, 
wash clothes, take baths... <PAGE>I don't want to 
shower with the 
dirty river water.

## POINTER 83
Welcome back, <STR>(YUR). 
Looks like you've caused 
a ruckus again.<PAGE>They're watching you, 
<STR>(YUR), so don't do anything 
crazy, okay?

## POINTER 84
What are you going to do now? 
<STR>(FRE)'s doing his duty as a 
knight, but you...

## POINTER 85
If it isn't <STR>(YUR) and 
the young lady.<PAGE>So you came back 
to Zaphias.

## POINTER 86
Don't even think 
about going uptown.<PAGE>The Knights are still looking 
for you all, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 87
They say <STR>(FRE)'s doing a great 
job with the Knights. It's all 
the lower quarter can talk about.<PAGE>He brought back the fountain's core, 
too. They can't praise <STR>(FRE)
enough, as far as I'm concerned.

## POINTER 88
You never change, do you 
<STR>(YUR)? Always letting 
<STR>(FRE) take the lead.<PAGE>I hope you'll show us what 
you're really made of one of 
these days, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 89
I sold the comb my late 
husband gave me to help raise 
money to fix the blastia. <PAGE>It was the first gift 
he ever gave me...

## POINTER 90
Will the house I spent so 
many years together with 
my husband in sink...? <PAGE>Why did I 
even bother...?

## POINTER 91
Thank you so much, <STR>(YUR). 
I think I'll be able to buy back 
the comb my husband gave me. <PAGE>You seem to have some 
trouble with the Knights... 
Is everything all right?

## POINTER 92
The aque blastia 
never got fixed, did it?<PAGE>What if the barrier 
blastia broke, too? 
That's a scary thought.

## POINTER 93
Is it safe for you to come 
back here, <STR>(YUR)? <PAGE>The Knights are all worked 
up looking for you.

## POINTER 94
Stay away from the 
castle, you hear? 
The Knights are on alert.

## POINTER 95
These are the 
people you're 
traveling with...? <PAGE>Isn't it a little dangerous 
tromping around with 
girls and children?

## POINTER 96
You be careful now.<PAGE>Leave the dangerous 
things to the Knights. 
Don't do anything crazy.

## POINTER 97
I knew you'd come! 
<STR>(YUR), it had to be you!<PAGE>What are you gonna do? 
What should I do to help?

## POINTER 98
<STR>(FRE) would always be here 
in no time when stuff like 
this happened. Why not now?<PAGE><STR>(FRE) shouldn't live in 
the castle when he could just 
commute from the lower quarter.

## POINTER 99
So, <STR>(YUR), you went and 
got yourself arrested, huh? Idiot! 
I guess that's like you, though.<PAGE>I went to the royal quarter
since you never came back. All 
the nobles were talking about you.
