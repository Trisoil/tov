## POINTER 1900
This assignment is such 
a nightmare, I muddied the 
fountain the other day.<PAGE>Nah, I'm just kidding. 
Just a fun little lie 
to pass the time...

## POINTER 1901
Hey, people drink that water. 
I wouldn't really do that. 
Maybe our captain would, but...

## POINTER 1902
......
Hurry up and leave if you don't 
have any business in this town.<PAGE>Hurry up and leave 
even if you do!

## POINTER 1903
Please. I'm begging you. 
You're just more people to watch.

## POINTER 1904
......
There's no way I'm following the 
captain after seeing that...<PAGE>But if I don't, I won't 
even be able to eat. What 
am I supposed to do...?

## POINTER 1905
When my mom, back in my 
hometown, heard I became a 
knight, she was so happy...<PAGE>*Sigh* I wish I had 
been assigned to a 
respectable captain...

## POINTER 1906
Hey... There's something strange 
about this town, right?<PAGE>Everyone's locked up inside their 
homes... And there's all these 
soldiers. Is something going on?

## POINTER 1907
Whoa, wait. The soldiers 
will notice us if we 
keep talking like this.

## POINTER 1908
You guys are really 
brave... Saving the 
kids from the Knights.<PAGE>There's no way I could 
do something like that!

## POINTER 1909
I'm not brave enough 
to confront the Knights!<PAGE>They'd throw me out 
into the desert 
if I defied them...

## POINTER 1910
What's this? Is this town 
dead or what? No wonder 
the crows were so noisy...

## POINTER 1911
Maybe the Knights 
killed all the people...<PAGE>I'm getting chills!

## POINTER 1912
Who does that 
Knight commander 
think he is?<PAGE>It's terrible! It's like 
they came here just to 
torture the townspeople.<PAGE>Even the way he talks makes me 
sick. One of these days, he's 
gonna make the wrong person mad.

## POINTER 1913
The Knights are supposed 
to protect the citizens, 
but just look at them...<PAGE>Isn't there *somebody* 
on the side of justice 
around here?

## POINTER 1914
If you plan on crossing the 
desert, you have to make sure 
you have enough water.<PAGE>If you don't keep 
hydrated, you'll shrivel 
up like a mummy!

## POINTER 1915
Not that anyone 
would have any reason 
to go into the desert.<PAGE>I mean, there's 
nothing out there.

## POINTER 1916
Hmm... It seemed like the 
Knights wanted to take the 
townspeople somewhere.<PAGE>It makes you wonder if 
they're even here on 
official business...

## POINTER 1917
I'm thinking about 
getting out of this town
 as soon as I can...<PAGE>But now I hear there's some giant 
winged monster out there... 
Oh, it's so scary!

## POINTER 1918
So there are good Knights after 
all... What's that guy's name? 
<STR>(FRE)? He's amazing.

## POINTER 1919
If only all the Knights 
were guys like <STR>(FRE)...

## POINTER 1920
I heard from another sailor 
there's trouble in Nordopolica.<PAGE>It seems some monsters 
from the coliseum 
escaped or something.<PAGE>Pretty scary, huh?

## POINTER 1921
This town has a 
barrier, though. We 
should be safe.

## POINTER 1922
Look, I've been all over 
the world. I've never 
seen a sky like that...<PAGE>Just bad weather...? 
I don't think so...

## POINTER 1923
What the hell is that? 
Huh? It looks like... 
a giant hand...?

## POINTER 1924
I think I'm about ready 
to get out of this town.<PAGE>Maybe I'll try my luck 
in that new town that 
was founded...

## POINTER 1925
A brand new town... 
I wonder what it's like?

## POINTER 1926
Wow, this actually is a really 
nice town, isn't it?<PAGE>Maybe I'll stay here 
a little longer.

## POINTER 1927
Say, why do you think that 
awful captain didn't 
put up a fuss?<PAGE>I guess it doesn't matter. 
They do say evil never prospers.

## POINTER 1928
I saw it. I saw it, I saw it! 
There was a huge bird 
flying in the sky!<PAGE>But that's only half of it! 
There was a dragon, too, 
even bigger than the bird! <PAGE>D-do you think our 
barrier will be enough 
to keep them out...?

## POINTER 1929
B-but of course, if it comes 
right down to it, I'll just zap 
them to death with my magic.

## POINTER 1930
H-hey, wait a minute! 
What's going on in the sky?<PAGE>That's a monster, isn't it? 
Just look at it!

## POINTER 1931
I wonder if it'll attack us...? 
I hope our barrier holds...<PAGE>I-I don't think my magic 
would be much use against 
something like that...

## POINTER 1932
North of here, near Mt. 
Temza, there's a place 
called Hell Valley.<PAGE>It's usually shrouded in 
clouds all year, but it 
cleared up all of a sudden.

## POINTER 1933
The clouds cleared away 
from the Valley of Hell... 
How could that be?<PAGE>Maybe the magma underground 
shifted or something...?

## POINTER 1934
This is Mantaic, an oasis 
in the middle of the desert. 
You can rest easy here.

## POINTER 1935
They say the last Knights were 
terrible. We will defend this town 
with our lives to make amends.

## POINTER 1936
I heard that there 
was some trouble in 
Nordopolica recently.<PAGE>Even so, our captain's 
orders are to stay here. 
It's so frustrating.

## POINTER 1937
This is Mantaic, an oasis... 
Oh, it's you folk? I guess you 
don't need the spiel anymore.

## POINTER 1938
Resting your weary bodies 
here after the long journey 
would be a fine idea.<PAGE>Hmm? The sky? Hah hah hah! 
Worrying won't change anything! 
I just won't think about it.

## POINTER 1939
Hey, it's you! 
Welcome to Mantaic!

## POINTER 1940
Why not have a rest 
here before you leave?

## POINTER 1941
The desert's scorching, but the 
town's nice and cool. We're doing all 
we can to preserve the peace here.

## POINTER 1942
Please let us know if you have 
any trouble. Captain <STR>(FRE)
has told us to listen well.

## POINTER 1943
Travelers have been 
telling me things are 
bad back in the Empire.<PAGE>I'm worried, but our orders are 
to keep the peace here in 
Mantaic. We must hold fast!

## POINTER 1944
With the Empire unstable, we 
must be resolute! We must not 
let the citizens fall to despair!

## POINTER 1945
I-is that a monster? H-how 
are we supposed to defend the town 
from something like that...?<PAGE>W-wait, what 
am I saying?!<PAGE>I can't panic... That would 
only worry the people. 
We must hold fast!

## POINTER 1946
I'm fine, I'm really fine... 
I'm not scared... I'm 
not scared at all...

## POINTER 1947
I-is that thing in the sky 
gonna attack or what? I wish 
it would make up its mind!

## POINTER 1948
But... I don't want it to 
make up its mind to come! 
Don't attack! Stay away!

## POINTER 1949
I saw something that looked 
like a massive bird in the 
sky before we came here.<PAGE>I asked around, but I was the 
only person in the brigade who 
saw it. Nobody believed me.

## POINTER 1950
Sure there aren't any 
flying monsters that size, 
but I know what I saw!<PAGE>Hmm... 
What do you 
think it was?

## POINTER 1951
*Grumble* 
A traveler told me he saw that 
giant bird, and a dragon, too!<PAGE>Why didn't anyone in our 
brigade see them? I still can't 
get anyone to believe me...

## POINTER 1952
Now I'm going to have a 
reputation as a bigmouth. I have 
to do something about that...

## POINTER 1953
With that weird thing in the 
sky, everyone's forgotten 
about the giant bird I saw.<PAGE>I guess I managed to escape 
getting branded a bigmouth, 
but I feel strange.

## POINTER 1954
Still, I'm even more 
concerned about that 
strange thing in the sky.

## POINTER 1955
You know that new town 
everyone's talking about? 
I hear it floats in the sky.<PAGE>...That's gotta be a lie. 
Whoever made that story up... 
That's a real bigmouth.

## POINTER 1956
But if it were true... Floating 
cities? And that huge monster? 
It's the end of the world.

## POINTER 1957
It seems that 
Captain Cumore
wasn't a real magistrate.<PAGE>He didn't want us to find 
out, so he prohibited the 
residents from going out.

## POINTER 1958
But I'm glad he wasn't a real 
magistrate. If he was, we wouldn't 
be able to run him out of town.

## POINTER 1959
The Knights in town 
are quite different from the 
ones that were here before!<PAGE>I guess this is the way 
genuine knights behave. 
They're so dependable.

## POINTER 1960
Their captain, too... I only saw him 
for a second, but he was so handsome! 
He seems like a wonderful guy.âˆ€

## POINTER 1961
Say, do you know about the hole 
back behind the inn? There's 
something...strange in it...<PAGE>What could it be? 
It's kind of scary...

## POINTER 1962
You people should probably 
stay away from it.

## POINTER 1963
I heard the castle
in Zaphias was 
destroyed recently...<PAGE>What's with all 
the strange things 
happening lately?

## POINTER 1964
The knights in the <STR>(FRE)
Brigade will protect this 
town. Everything's fine.<PAGE>We have our barrier, too.

## POINTER 1965
You know that city floating in 
the sky? I wonder if it was on the 
ground, and then just took off!<PAGE>This town isn't going to go, 
"Fwoop!" and sail off into the 
sky too some day, is it?

## POINTER 1966
What are we going 
to do if this town 
starts floating...?<PAGE>We won't be able to import 
food from other towns anymore. 
I hope we don't starve.

## POINTER 1967
Whew... I can finally get out of 
the house and walk around. I thought 
I'd never see the sun again...<PAGE>This is all thanks 
to that young 
Knight, <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 1968
The Knight who was here 
before... Cu-something? 
He was terrible.<PAGE>Where did he run off to? 
I'd wager he got caught 
and thrown in jail.

## POINTER 1969
The town is finally free again, 
but now there's all this hubbub 
about giant birds and the Empire.<PAGE>Everyone's in such a fuss. People 
should take things easy, like me. 
Otherwise, life'll tire you out.

## POINTER 1970
Honestly, I'm more afraid 
of my wife's scoldings.

## POINTER 1971
*Fgggh...grph...grrph... 
fthrrrp...gggh*

## POINTER 1972
Oh my, I forgot to 
put in my dentures! 
Hah hah hah.

## POINTER 1973
All the brouhaha lately 
has some folk saying 
it's the end of the world.<PAGE>Foolishness. Do they really 
think the world's going 
to end that easily?

## POINTER 1974
It seems like the younger 
people are, the gloomier they 
are... Kids, I swear...

## POINTER 1975
I'm just thankful to be free, 
I guess. You only miss 
something once you lose it...<PAGE>We've all got the 
knights of the <STR>(FRE)
Brigade to thank for that.

## POINTER 1976
Now we'll be able to 
live without worrying.

## POINTER 1977
That giant bird... 
I bet its droppings 
are simply nasty.<PAGE>Oh dear. Excuse me 
for saying something 
so indelicate.

## POINTER 1978
Oh no! Now that I have 
that thought in my head! 
I can't shake it...

## POINTER 1979
Dearie me. It's just one 
strange happening right 
after another, isn't it?<PAGE>What's going to come along 
after that big, sickening 
thing in the sky?

## POINTER 1980
Oh, I know what's next. 
The sun's going to split 
into three, or something.

## POINTER 1981
Goodness gracious. 
The right answer was a 
city being built in the sky.<PAGE>I was so sure it'd be 
three suns after that 
giant flying monster...

## POINTER 1982
I guess it doesn't really matter. 
It's not a quiz, after all.

## POINTER 1983
What?! That 
bastard Cumore
ran away?<PAGE>I was hoping I'd get 
to pound him good.

## POINTER 1984
He must've been 
scared of me. 
Hah hah hah!

## POINTER 1985
Owww... My old lady 
really went to work 
on me again.<PAGE>All I did was stay out 'til 
dawn three days in a row... 
Is that so bad...?

## POINTER 1986
You agree with me, 
don't you?

## POINTER 1987
*Hic!*<PAGE>Uh? Whuzzah? Look, thurrrs a big 
ol' monster in the skyyyy... 
Hah hah hah!

## POINTER 1988
Uh ohhh... 
my ol' lady's gonna 
blow up again...<PAGE>She's gonna be sayin', "You big 
oaf! What're you doin' drinkin' 
in tha m-middle of the day"...!

## POINTER 1989
My wife thought I was 
drinking too much, so she 
slashed my allowance...<PAGE>Now I can only afford 
one drink per day... 
I-it's the end of the world!

## POINTER 1990
What? You want to know why 
I'm not that concerned about 
monsters and cities in the sky?<PAGE>That stuff ain't nothing 
compared to getting your 
allowance cut... *Sniffle*...

## POINTER 1991
I just stopped in here at 
Mantaic on my vacation, but it 
really is a lovely town, isn't it?

## POINTER 1992
I heard some horror stories 
about the Knights here, but they 
don't seem to be a problem now.

## POINTER 1993
Apparently a large number of 
troops came here a while ago, 
and then left quickly.<PAGE>Whatever could have happened?

## POINTER 1994
Not that the comings and goings 
of soldiers has any bearing 
on my vacation, of course.

## POINTER 1995
Wh-what is that nasty 
thing in the sky?

## POINTER 1996
I once had a meal prepared by a 
young lady from the family of my 
acquaintances, the Kimlascas.<PAGE>Compared to that meal, 
the thing in the sky 
isn't very vile at all.

## POINTER 1997
The new town that was 
founded floats upon the 
air, does it not?<PAGE>I've made up my mind! 
That's where I'll 
be traveling next.

## POINTER 1998
What manner of town 
could it be? I hope they 
have high-class salons...

## POINTER 1999
Thank you, mister! 
And misses!<PAGE>Everyone's so happy now!
