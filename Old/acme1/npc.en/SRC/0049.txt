It's late, travelers. 
Do what's best and stay 
the night at the inn.

## POINTER 4901
If you wander about too late, you're 
likely to run into the mer-people 
who come ashore at night.

## POINTER 4902
Early checkout will save you 3 Gald, but 
late checkin costs 3 Gald extra. Why not 
call it a day and stay at the inn?

## POINTER 4903
It's gotten quite late, you 
know. You must be sleepy.

## POINTER 4904
Haste makes waste, as they say. Why not 
take a breather and slow things down. 
Here now, right this way to the inn.

## POINTER 4905
It's bad luck to wander about 
too much after dark. You'd be 
wise to stay a night with us.

## POINTER 4906
You may be in town, but the dark can 
be quite dangerous. Best to stay 
a night with us, if you ask me.

## POINTER 4907
Where could you be off 
to at this late hour? 
Why not stay with us?

## POINTER 4908
Ragou, you no good cheat. 
Hick... Let us take the 
boats out, dammit...<PAGE>It's gettin' ta be, I can't get 
by without drinkin' these days...

## POINTER 4909
I want ta be on a ship again! 
Ta be out on the sea...

## POINTER 4910
A man's at home on the 
sea. *Hic*... I can hear 
it callin' me... <PAGE>A toast, to 
the sea!

## POINTER 4911
O, a man needs the 
sea! Needs ta travel 
the ocean's roads!

## POINTER 4912
What's the deal with this town, anyway? 
Hick... A fella's liable ta go stir 
crazy, in a place like this...<PAGE>But I can send my sorrows packin', so 
long as I've got my drink ta help me.

## POINTER 4913
O, the sea... O, the 
sun... Ahh, there's 
nothin' finer...

## POINTER 4914
Was that south, ya said...? 
Hick... If you're talkin' bearings, 
then speak up man...!<PAGE>Ooh... What the... 
What the hell's gonna 
happen ta me...?

## POINTER 4915
Sing...! O, 
inverted 
world...!

## POINTER 4916
I saw a ring, I did! 
Hick... What the hell's 
that mean, huh...?!<PAGE>Urgh...<PAGE>I'm in the mood for a drink!

## POINTER 4917
A ring...! It's 
round. Perfectly...round...?

## POINTER 4918
Somethin' not right with 
that sky. Hick... Aw, 
who gives a damn...?<PAGE>It all disappears when 
I drink, right...?!

## POINTER 4919
This ugly sky! My hands and my feet! 
I want to forget it all...!

## POINTER 4920
That earthquake freaked 
me out, man... Hick... 
I don't feel so good...<PAGE>The sky's spinnin. 
I can't feel 
my legs...!

## POINTER 4921
I'm a man...! Go ahead an' 
crumble, ya mountain...! 
Damn, that's scary...!

## POINTER 4922
"Rhybgaro! A beast that shines like the 
golden light of the sun! Will he appear 
in the vicinity of Torim Harbor?"<PAGE>That's what the paper said. It likes 
the water, so apparently it only 
shows itself on rainy days.

## POINTER 4923
Ahh, what a lovely color, gold... The 
world is coming up roses, my dears.

## POINTER 4924
Heard the headlines? "New magistrate to be appointed 
in Torim Harbor! And only 18 years old!"<PAGE>As of tomorrow, 
this town is going 
to be reborn.

## POINTER 4925
Ahh, I love the smell of renewal in the morning... 
The world's coming up roses, my dears.

## POINTER 4926
Did you hear? "The Duce of the coliseum's 
hidden past revealed! Mastermind of 
the Great War falls at last!" Finally, 
I can sleep soundly at night.

## POINTER 4927
Ahh, my but peace is lovely... The 
world is coming up roses, my dears.

## POINTER 4928
Have you heard? "The citizens of the capital 
take leave for a new promised land! Will 
they find the hope of a new life?"<PAGE>The capital may have been ruined, 
but maybe this'll give those 
folks a new start.

## POINTER 4929
Ahh, the frontier spirit is a beautiful thing... 
The world's coming up roses, my dears.

## POINTER 4930
This one says "Capital Liberated! 
Disorder Continues"! <PAGE>I'm just glad they've 
avoided the fate our 
town had to suffer.

## POINTER 4931
Ahh, isn't liberation simply marvelous...? 
The world's coming up roses, my dears.

## POINTER 4932
"Mysterious ruins surface on the seas! Knights 
arrive on scene, relieve world's fears!" 
or so I hear. Well thank goodness.<PAGE>No telling what might 
happen if that thing 
were left unattended.

## POINTER 4933
Ahh, my but those Knights are certainly dashing... 
The world's coming up roses, my dears.

## POINTER 4934
Yo travelers, what's up? Welcome 
to the port town of Capua Nor.

## POINTER 4935
Capua is split between Capua 
Nor to the south and Capua 
Torim to the North.<PAGE>You're in Nor now, on the south side.

## POINTER 4936
I've heard the barrier in the 
capital's been torn down.<PAGE>Hope our blastia here's 
gonna be okay.

## POINTER 4937
The blastia of this town is fashioned 
in the shape of an anchor.<PAGE>Look here, see how it's 
written on the ground?

## POINTER 4938
I heard they managed to get the blastia 
in the capital back under control more 
or less, but you never can be too sure.<PAGE>We've got to...well, get this 
town ready for...for whatever 
tomorrow might bring...

## POINTER 4939
I hear we get researchers from Aspio 
that come now and again to keep 
our blastia in good repair.<PAGE>'Course the patient's always 
gonna protest that they're 
in good health.

## POINTER 4940
We've been having a series of earthquakes in these parts, 
recently. Makes you wonder, you know. I've always thought 
the bedrock around here was supposed to be solid.

## POINTER 4941
I swear there's more than meets the eye with 
these earthquakes. It just might have something 
to do with that monster up in the sky...

## POINTER 4942
Aspio was located right smack at the 
base of that tower. It had to've been 
just flattened, no two ways about it.<PAGE>Now who's gonna come to 
do maintenance on the 
blastia, I ask ya...?

## POINTER 4943
Gotta admit though, that thing is the definition 
of big. Wouldn't be surprised if the entire 
Ilyccian continent just up and sank...

## POINTER 4944
I can't stop thinking 
about that sound. What 
could it have been? <PAGE>They really should post news 
up on the boards faster.

## POINTER 4945
I just can't wait 
for them to post the 
latest news here.<PAGE>I'm so excited!

## POINTER 4946
It says, "Commandant Flynn of 
the Imperial Knights Building City 
on Hypionia. Open Call for Names."<PAGE>I just might go...

## POINTER 4947
Ahh, there's nothing like breaking new ground, I tell you... The world's coming up roses my dears.

## POINTER 4948
Lakiko... My dearest friend...<PAGE>Ragou took her away, and I 
haven't seen her since...

## POINTER 4949
I don't want to have to go. 
Does that make me selfish...?

## POINTER 4950
I've been so worried about that girl, 
I haven't been getting any sleep.<PAGE>My dear friend has come back 
from Ragou's mansion... Oh, I 
hope everything's all right.

## POINTER 4951
Her mother says that she still 
wakes herself up each night with 
the sounds of her own screams.

## POINTER 4952
I haven't been able to sleep 
since my friend told me 
about Ragou's misdeeds.<PAGE>I'm so glad I didn't press her to tell me everything.

## POINTER 4953
I have these bad dreams every night. 
These bodiless people won't 
stop staring at me... Ooh...

## POINTER 4954
When I go to bed at night I have 
nightmares so I can't sleep...<PAGE>And I have to stay awake during 
the day, so I can't sleep then...

## POINTER 4955
Wow... I am working on a serious 
sleep deficit here...

## POINTER 4956
Ragou kept me from sleeping, but 
lately, I've finally started getting 
to sleep more regularly.<PAGE>For a while there, I wanted 
to sleep so badly I thought 
I might go crazy.

## POINTER 4957
But now I can't keep from thinking 
awful thoughts during my waking hours. 
I guess I'm just no good...

## POINTER 4958
Did you see the new magistrate? 
He's a friendly looking young 
guy with blond hair.<PAGE>The last magistrate looked 
like he'd be a friendly 
old man at first, too.

## POINTER 4959
Power eventually corrupts the personalities 
of people who hold it.<PAGE>...That's what that knight 
with the mask and the spiky 
green hair said, anyway.

## POINTER 4960
The taxes aren't going down! I even 
saw the guy at that stall over there 
start crying. It's just rotten.<PAGE>What with the taxes 
so high, nobody 
can buy anything.

## POINTER 4961
Higher taxes should mean greater 
returns to the people, and further 
benefit to their lives.<PAGE>...Or at least that's what the 
roly-poly egghead with the blue 
hair and the scary voice said.

## POINTER 4962
I heard the ocean to the north got all frozen 
solid because of that "aer" stuff.<PAGE>Hey, if the sea water freezes, 
do you think the ice 
would taste salty?

## POINTER 4963
The "aer" makes it possible for us 
to live our daily lives. We must 
give thanks for its existence.<PAGE>...That's what that pink-haired 
Krityan lady with 
a broom said.

## POINTER 4964
It's awesome! A bunch of the 
empire's battleships are docked 
in the harbor right now.<PAGE>What's so cool about that? Well, 
they're made all out of metal!

## POINTER 4965
The warship called Sieg Krunos 
does 30 knots on the open sea, 
with its "eh-ar terbines." <PAGE>...That's what the tan, 
short-haired, tomboy-looking 
sailor girl was saying, anyway.

## POINTER 4966
Besides, even if the world is ending, 
as long as we don't give up 
hope, we can go on fighting.<PAGE>...I heard that from 
this hero with spiky 
blond hair.

## POINTER 4967
Have you gone up the tower that came 
out of that mountain in the north?<PAGE>It looks like it's made 
up of a bunch of different 
buildings.

## POINTER 4968
The giant cities of the past were made 
up of buildings all stacked together that 
you'd think they were really towers.<PAGE>...That's what this sword fighter 
wearing this big white bone 
thing on his head said.

## POINTER 4969
If only Ragou hadn't come, 
my future would be looking 
a lot more rosy...<PAGE>Everything I touch lately seems 
to turn to dirt. What can someone 
like me do to get along...?

## POINTER 4970
I guess I'm just no good. And 
the night only seems to make 
my mood even worse...

## POINTER 4971
That was a really loud rumble. 
But it didn't phase me. <PAGE>Nothing gets done 
by worrying.

## POINTER 4972
I should thank Ragou for 
giving me the courage 
to face anything. <PAGE>Luckily, he isn't around 
to accept my gratitude.

## POINTER 4973
There was a time when all I did was worry. But I realized, what's the point?<PAGE>I've got to keep my chin up. Life's too short, right?

## POINTER 4974
When unimaginable events occur, all the little things in life seem to mean less to people.

## POINTER 4975
I hear there's a guy who badmouths 
the magistrate, but he'll only 
do it under the cover of night.<PAGE>If he's gonna gripe, he 
should do it out in the 
open, you know, like me.

## POINTER 4976
We can complain all we like, though. It's 
not like anybody in charge is gonna listen.<PAGE>Not so long as they get to 
use us for their amusement.

## POINTER 4977
That damned Council, with its damned high 
taxes... It's enough to make a fella wanna 
give up on earning an honest living.

## POINTER 4978
I mean, even when I get paid, my 
wallet's empty by the next day. 
Maybe I should just quit my job.

## POINTER 4979
If the Don were to die, it'd upset the 
balance between the empire and the guilds, 
and most likely turn to all out war.<PAGE>Hip hip hooray, 
we'll all go down 
together.

## POINTER 4980
...If that happens though, one guild or another's gonna 
make a bid for power, which'll mean using that power 
to put down anybody who gets in their way. Gah...<PAGE>Fools, the lot 
of them!

## POINTER 4981
We've got the guilds, the Council, 
and now it's the Knights.<PAGE>They're only interested in 
using what power they've got 
to run things their way.

## POINTER 4982
Just you watch. Sooner or later 
this <STR>(FRE) character's gonna 
show his true colors.

## POINTER 4983
That boat carrying all those 
refugees has gotta be 
in rough shape. It's cramped, 
it stinks. Man, gives 
me goose bumps just 
thinking about it.

## POINTER 4984
Whatever, not like it's any skin 
off my back what happens to 
that bunch from the capital.

## POINTER 4985
First the Don dies, then that Commandant of the Knights 
checks out. You'd think we're due for some peace 
and quiet, and then we get this thing with Aspio.<PAGE>What the hell are all those mages 
cooking up over there, anyway?

## POINTER 4986
They're weak, but they 
have some weird powers. <PAGE>But they don't have a clue 
how to use their power. 
We should be okay...

## POINTER 4987
Isn't that tower around Aspio? <PAGE>I think the mages are 
definitely planning something.

## POINTER 4988
I mean, a mage brought that 
tower back to begin with. <PAGE>He's going to monopolize 
the blastia and get the 
Empire on his side.

## POINTER 4989
Besides, it's not like the empire or the 
guilds can really do anything about it.

## POINTER 4990
You can never count on these guys 
when you really need them.

## POINTER 4991
If you're looking for something to snack 
on after dark, gels are the way to go.<PAGE>Low in fat, and easy 
on the digestion, there's 
no beating gels.

## POINTER 4992
Now if there was something like a night gel, 
you know, that put you right to sleep, my midnight 
snacking regimen would be complete.

## POINTER 4993
At night I hide a few gels 
under my pillow, and snack 
on them in secret.<PAGE>Don't tell my husband, okay?

## POINTER 4994
I'm so crazy about gels, I don't 
know what to do with myself.

## POINTER 4995
If there's a problem with distribution, 
supply and demand will break down, and 
we'll be looking at a gel shortage.

## POINTER 4996
If I couldn't have gels in 
my life, I think my heart 
might just shrivel up...!

## POINTER 4997
This town's become quite a tough place 
for people to live. It used to be 
such a sleepy little place...

## POINTER 4998
Now, Nor and Torim are different 
as night and day...<PAGE>Don't the guilds or the 
empire care at all how folks 
like us are livin'?

## POINTER 4999
We never had a magistrate 
here when I was younger. <PAGE>When did the Empire 
get so strict...?
