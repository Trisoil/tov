## POINTER 5800
Work, work! 
There is no night 
or day for you.<PAGE>Work and be rewarded. 
Maybe.

## POINTER 5801
The sound of the blastia? 
You should be sleeping at night. <PAGE>Stop bugging me 
with trivial matters.

## POINTER 5802
There's nothing to be afraid of at night.

## POINTER 5803
I'm the one watching it so 
there is no need to fear of 
another blastia incident! <PAGE>If you keep wailing about 
it, your life may just end 
before morning.

## POINTER 5804
We must make opportunity out of disaster!

## POINTER 5805
Commandant Alexei, huh... 
What a sissy.<PAGE>They should make Sir 
Cumore the Commandant...

## POINTER 5806
Huh? Were you listening 
to my mumbling...? <PAGE>...I was just kidding, you know.

## POINTER 5807
We humans are all the same. Though we may 
delight in the misfortune of others, we 
cannot bear to be unhappy ourselves.<PAGE>There are those who would use their 
power to rob others of their happiness, 
and replace it with sorrow.

## POINTER 5808
And those creatures are called the nobility!

## POINTER 5809
They say that
someone's acting up in there.<PAGE>Me?
You don't want me
to get hurt.

## POINTER 5810
Let the others
do the dirty work.<PAGE>It's not worth
getting injured over.

## POINTER 5811
The lift may not be used without permission.<PAGE>We cannot allow unauthorized personnel to pass.

## POINTER 5812
Ask all you like, my answer will not change.

## POINTER 5813
Under no circumstances 
can I let you through.

## POINTER 5814
We have averted a crisis, but 
I still cannot let you pass.

## POINTER 5815
You sure are persistent...<PAGE>You cannot pass!

## POINTER 5816
Beyond this point is forbidden. 
I cannot let you pass!

## POINTER 5817
Don't even think about 
sneaking past just because 
 it is dark.<PAGE>I see very well 
in the dark. 
I was a wolf in my last life you see.

## POINTER 5818
If there is any evil in this world, 
it rests in the hearts of losers.

## POINTER 5819
No matter the age, to the victors go the spoils!

## POINTER 5820
Leave the night 
protection to the 
Cumore Brigade! <PAGE>As long as the commoners 
are protected, we've done 
our job!

## POINTER 5821
The path of the Knight is paved with endurance.

## POINTER 5822
Why does a strong knight like 
me have to be reprimanded 
by the Commandant...?<PAGE>This afternoon's blunder 
wasn't all my fault...

## POINTER 5823
I never thought 
the blastia would 
get out of control...<PAGE>It was so scary...

## POINTER 5824
Don't wander around at night. That's 
what causes security problems! <PAGE>Do anything suspicious and I'll 
throw you in the slammer.

## POINTER 5825
You see, the darkness reveals things 
that the harsh light of day 
renders all but invisible...

## POINTER 5826
No matter how far you may have climbed, 
there will always be someone above you.<PAGE>We all have walls that we will 
never be able to conquer.

## POINTER 5827
The common folk can draw some comfort from 
realizing that there are those with even 
less fortunate lots in life than they.

## POINTER 5828
If you wish to join the nobility, you must 
work tirelessly, regardless of the hour.

## POINTER 5829
This shouldn't be a problem for those who want it badly enough!

## POINTER 5830
Only death awaits those who do not fight against 
life's hardships with all their might.

## POINTER 5831
Our task is to create escape 
routes for life's dead ends.

## POINTER 5832
For the sake of the 
world, its people... <PAGE>And for our own 
sakes as well...<PAGE>It's not hypocritical. 
It can't be.

## POINTER 5833
Sympathy is not just 
for other's sake. <PAGE>That's not to mean 
that sympathy doesn't 
do any good.

## POINTER 5834
Whether tomorrow, next week, or even 
a year from now, times come in all our 
lives that instill us with hope.<PAGE>Holding on to such hope is well and 
good, but only for those who live each 
day of their lives to the fullest.

## POINTER 5835
A knight's duty is to protect the
citizen's hopes and dreams!

## POINTER 5836
Are ideals nothing 
more than dreams?<PAGE>All the tired people 
have left this town.

## POINTER 5837
Everyday the same hard labor 
slowly eat away at the people 
making them leave this town.<PAGE>Look at the town now.

## POINTER 5838
The laborers have bitter work to do, but keeping 
an eye on them is not as easy as it might seem.

## POINTER 5839
My shift has got to be up soon.

## POINTER 5840
Maybe I could make a run for it when night falls...

## POINTER 5841
No, no, I mean I'll plan a strategic retreat!

## POINTER 5842
To be frank, I can't stomach work this dangerous 
for the little pay we receive.

## POINTER 5843
Human beings are selfish creatures after all, when you get down to it.

## POINTER 5844
You know, I actually
 don't like standing guard.<PAGE>Why did I every become 
a Knight.

## POINTER 5845
I wonder if there's 
a job that I can give 
everything to.<PAGE>I guess not eh?

## POINTER 5846
I want to quit being a Knight, 
but I don't want to work on 
the town restoration either.<PAGE>There's nothing 
else though.

## POINTER 5847
Town restoration sounds 
tough.<PAGE>Maybe I should go 
back to Zaphias.

## POINTER 5848
When I'm not eating or sleeping, 
I'm always working.

## POINTER 5849
But I've got to put up with it if I've 
got any hope of becoming a noble.

## POINTER 5850
The towns that don't have barrier blastia 
get attacked by the monsters.

## POINTER 5851
No monster's gonna take a bite out of 
me before I become a noble, no sir!

## POINTER 5852
I ran straight out in 
the face of danger... <PAGE>Maybe I don't have what 
it takes to be nobility.

## POINTER 5853
If any worthless dog can be a 
noble just by dressing up in 
a bunch of funny clothes...<PAGE>Then surely I've got what it 
takes to be a noble, too!

## POINTER 5854
If a commoner steals from a noble, 
they face severe punishment. <PAGE>But if a noble were to kill a commoner, they 
don't get charged with anything at all.

## POINTER 5855
Sometimes, you can't help 
feeling like just being 
a commoner is crime.

## POINTER 5856
Seems like 
the Imperial Knights 
are busy.<PAGE>You hear young girl's 
scream coming from their facility 
day and night.

## POINTER 5857
Whenever I ask the Knights, 
they tell me I'm hearing 
things.<PAGE>Am I 
going crazy?

## POINTER 5858
What's this? I swear I heard 
something coming from inside 
the facility.

## POINTER 5859
What is it? 
Do they have some 
pet monster?

## POINTER 5860
Telling a lie is considered a crime, 
but only for the common people.<PAGE>A noble can never be faulted for deceiving 
a commoner, no matter the situation.

## POINTER 5861
That is the law in this town.

## POINTER 5862
Working together forms 
strong bonds and 
friendships. <PAGE>That's something that 
money just can't buy.

## POINTER 5863
If the people of this city don't come together, 
there is no future for them here.

## POINTER 5864
Making money by doing business and 
contributing to the welfare of the 
people are one and the same thing.<PAGE>The money people are willing 
to pay for such a contribution 
is your profit.

## POINTER 5865
Therefore, you can't make money if the 
service you provide doesn't benefit 
the people, and even if you did...<PAGE>It would only come back to 
haunt you sooner or later.

## POINTER 5866
Nobles are ones 
who cannot work.<PAGE>That's a shame that there
aren't any work for them to do.

## POINTER 5867
I'm grateful to have a body 
that can handle work. <PAGE>I'm so glad I didn't 
become a noble.

## POINTER 5868
Say a person lived a life full of suffering, 
but achieved happiness in the 
final moments before death...<PAGE>How would you judge such a life?

## POINTER 5869
Say a person lived a life brimming 
over with happiness, but lost 
this joy and died miserably...<PAGE>How would you judge such a life?

## POINTER 5870
I wake up earlier and work 
later than anyone. <PAGE>Now, I think I'll 
go home and sleep.

## POINTER 5871
I've got to manage at least that if I want 
my work ethic to make a good impression.

## POINTER 5872
Don't worry. 
Work during the day 
and sleep at night. <PAGE>Better to get to bed 
early at night.

## POINTER 5873
Getting up in the morning, working during 
the day, eating in the evening, and 
sleeping at night. That's all it is.

## POINTER 5874
I'm glad they got the barrier 
blastia working again. <PAGE>Without it, the work just 
wouldn't get done.

## POINTER 5875
You'd be surprised what a little discipline 
in your daily routine can do for you.

## POINTER 5876
Ahh, I'm worn out...

## POINTER 5877
There's no greater satisfaction than resting 
at the end of a long day of work.

## POINTER 5878
It's been dozens of years since I first started working...

## POINTER 5879
I'll be made a noble any day now, I can feel it.

## POINTER 5880
Madness rules the night!

## POINTER 5881
It's dark, I'm scared, I'm 
dying... It's killing me!

## POINTER 5882
I thought I was gonna 
die... It's best to get 
out of this city. <PAGE>But outside the barrier blastia 
lies a world of danger! 
What am I to do...?

## POINTER 5883
Inside the barrier, the blastia 
might go out of control. 
Outside, the monsters await. <PAGE>I'm caught between a rock 
and a hard place...

## POINTER 5884
I'm already old. I don't 
have much longer. <PAGE>But before I pass, I'll 
become a Knight.

## POINTER 5885
The most under-developed place in this world, 
is the spot right under your own hat...

## POINTER 5886
Happiness is like a butterfly.<PAGE>The more you chase after it, 
the more it teases you, dancing 
just out of reach.

## POINTER 5887
Just listen to me. You'd think there was no point 
in seeking happiness at all from the way I talk.

## POINTER 5888
Happiness is like a butterfly.<PAGE>It approaches those who tend to their work 
in silence, perching softly on their shoulder 
before they know it's even there.

## POINTER 5889
Happiness is just like that.

## POINTER 5890
There are those who say the nobility 
will never accept us...<PAGE>But becoming a noble has haunted my dreams, it's been 
my only goal, the reason I've worked so hard.

## POINTER 5891
The city's construction is 
shoddy. I hear even the bridge 
supports are wobbly.<PAGE>It's so scary...

## POINTER 5892
There's one thought I always have before I sleep...<PAGE>I wonder if maybe, tomorrow 
will finally be the day...

## POINTER 5893
I didn't doubt it for a second 
when I was younger...<PAGE>But lately, I've begun to worry a bit.

## POINTER 5894
I was shocked to learn that 
I can't become a noble.<PAGE>But I'm sleeping better at night 
than I have in a long, long time.

## POINTER 5895
Besides, I've always felt that I've had a noble heart...<PAGE>And there's nothing that can change 
that, now or anytime in the future.

## POINTER 5896
Let's get to work! Can't 
afford to fall behind!

## POINTER 5897
But nighttime's the time for sleep.

## POINTER 5898
Think we'll be well paid if we really put our noses down and work?<PAGE>Well paid? Yeah right! More 
likely we'll be well flayed!

## POINTER 5899
This world's full of liars and cheats!
