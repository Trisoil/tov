## POINTER 600
I really, really don't 
want to be eaten...

## POINTER 601
Will the Knights 
protect this town?

## POINTER 602
If they did, our defense 
certainly would be tough.

## POINTER 603
I can no longer see the 
monster that used to wander 
close to the city until recently.

## POINTER 604
It probably gave up due 
to the blastia in this city.

## POINTER 605
Being young and beautiful is 
nothing special, but to be old and 
beautiful... That is true beauty.

## POINTER 606
I wonder how old the 
Tree of Halure is.

## POINTER 607
How should we welcome 
the refugees? <PAGE>Should we console 
them, or just not talk 
about the situation...?

## POINTER 608
We don't know how to 
deal with so many people 
fleeing at once.

## POINTER 609
The Tree of Halure may seem static, 
but in fact it grew little by little 
into the towering giant it is.

## POINTER 610
We are the same. 
Little by little, day by 
day, we grow as well.

## POINTER 611
We need a blastia engineer 
to repair the blastia... <PAGE>But there's no one 
like that in this city.

## POINTER 612
At this rate, the town will 
be overrun by monsters...

## POINTER 613
The blastia started working 
again when the flowers of 
Halure returned... <PAGE>What kind of place is this...? 
This place is really interesting.

## POINTER 614
This is a good chance 
for me to study blastia...

## POINTER 615
There seems to be 
a town of mages to the 
east of this town. <PAGE>I'd like to go there 
and study the blastia.

## POINTER 616
I'd like to go to Aspio but
stepping out of the barrier
is dangerous. <PAGE>It's just my luck.

## POINTER 617
I'd like to study blastia and feel 
secure enough to repair the barrier 
blastia if it ever falls apart. <PAGE>And this feeling grows 
stronger by the day.

## POINTER 618
I can't stop worrying 
about when we will lose 
the blastia again.

## POINTER 619
I've organized all the 
issues with the blastia 
in my head but... <PAGE>Argh... 
I can't think straight with 
everything going on...!

## POINTER 620
I want to escape so I 
can think quietly again.

## POINTER 621
Hey mister! 
Stop by the historic old 
Denebola if you're tired!

## POINTER 622
We're helping our dad.

## POINTER 623
Come on by the 
historic old Denebola 
inn if you're tired.

## POINTER 624
We get one piece of candy 
when we help our dad.

## POINTER 625
The historic old 
Denebola inn is right 
above the stairs. <PAGE>Stop by if you're tired.

## POINTER 626
We get 100 Gald when 
we help our dad.

## POINTER 627
Are you tired? 
Then try the historic 
old Denebola inn. <PAGE>We'll take good 
care of you.

## POINTER 628
Oh... I'm tired... 
Can you all help me 
bring in some customers?

## POINTER 629
Stop by the historic 
old Denebola inn! <PAGE>Thanks for coming. 
You all aren't gonna 
stay at the inn today?

## POINTER 630
The Denebola is free 
to anyone right now.

## POINTER 631
Why did it have to die...?

## POINTER 632
If you follow the 
hill up, you'll come to 
the Tree of Halure. <PAGE>It has been restored 
to beautiful life!

## POINTER 633
Thank you for reviving the Tree.

## POINTER 634
If you follow the 
hill up, you'll come to 
the Tree of Halure. <PAGE>Three types of flowers 
bloom on it...oh, do you 
already know about them?

## POINTER 635
How can three 
different flowers bloom 
on one tree...?

## POINTER 636
The Tree of Halure is 
not immortal. The Tree may 
one day wither and die.

## POINTER 637
We're all the same... 
It seems a little sad 
when I put it that way.

## POINTER 638
I heard that Zaphias
is in real trouble, 
but is Halure okay? <PAGE>Did the Commandant of the Knights 
do something? I didn't think 
he was...evil...I guess?

## POINTER 639
I don't think that the 
Commandant of the Knights will 
invade Zaphias... will he?

## POINTER 640
These people escaped 
from Aspio after that 
tower destroyed it. <PAGE>There's a strange 
feeling in the air...

## POINTER 641
The people of this 
town are all tired for 
no apparent reason. <PAGE>I don't know if I caught 
their bug, but I've felt 
really tired recently...

## POINTER 642
We have lost everything...<PAGE>But we still live.

## POINTER 643
As long as we live, 
there is hope.

## POINTER 644
Our losses are great, 
but we will not despair.

## POINTER 645
Making new discoveries is 
our greatest happiness...

## POINTER 646
Halure shall remain at 
peace as long as the 
flowers continue to bloom.

## POINTER 647
Some unknown illness has hit 
a lot of people recently.<PAGE>There are no visible 
symptoms, but it seems to 
make people tire faster...

## POINTER 648
Sometimes, I feel 
sick to my stomach. <PAGE>At least I can still get 
outside and walk around.

## POINTER 649
This is the Krityan 
city of Myorzo. I'm the 
guard at this gate. <PAGE>Nice to meet you.

## POINTER 650
It's been a while since 
humans have come to Myorzo. 
Come in, come in.

## POINTER 651
I am a gatekeeper 
for this city. <PAGE>We love having 
visitors from outside! 
Come in, come in.

## POINTER 652
Why am I living in a place like 
this? Well... I guess because that's 
what my ancestors decided...?

## POINTER 653
It's great you've come, welcome. 
Come in, come in. <PAGE>Sure I'm guarding the gate, 
but without guests, 
I'm just bored, bored...

## POINTER 654
I'm a gatekeeper here. <PAGE>But I really don't know 
what I'm specifically supposed 
to do as a guard.

## POINTER 655
I remember seeing a flying 
monster at the elder's 
home a long time ago. <PAGE>

## POINTER 656
Myorzo is protected by 
the Entelexeia. We'll be safe 
no matter what happens.

## POINTER 657
I remember seeing a flying 
monster at the elder's 
home a long time ago. <PAGE>...Just between us, I 
was threatened to keep 
what I saw a secret.

## POINTER 658
That's big... Huge... 
I wonder what that is...

## POINTER 659
The world is in danger! 
Aaaah, I'm scared! ♪ <PAGE>I guess that's not 
something I should 
be saying right now.

## POINTER 660
We can take them 
on together. 
Charge! ♪

## POINTER 661
Welcome to Myorzo. 
You can't even kill time 
coming to a place like this.

## POINTER 662
You must be so bored to 
come to a city like this.

## POINTER 663
There was a large 
noise by the entrance. <PAGE>I was so surprised.

## POINTER 664
Oh, I was so surprised... 
Don't I look surprised? <PAGE>That's weird...

## POINTER 665
The elder told me 
to help search for 
your friends... <PAGE>But they're not here.

## POINTER 666
It's that suspicious man 
and cute princess of a girl 
that went missing, right?

## POINTER 667
Welcome to Myorzo. 
You're back...? You must 
be pretty bored...

## POINTER 668
Is this city 
really that good? 
If you say so... <PAGE>Well... 
I guess it is 
a nice place.

## POINTER 669
There's such a commotion 
outside. Do something 
about it. Please.

## POINTER 670
You can start with 
taking care of that 
monster in the sky.

## POINTER 671
That giant building 
is scary. <PAGE>What'll happen if that 
crashes into Myorzo?

## POINTER 672
You have to do 
something or else...

## POINTER 673
Hmm? Oh, you're the people 
that came from outside? 
How boring. You're so...normal.

## POINTER 674
*Sigh* 
I can't believe you people 
still use blastia...

## POINTER 675
That was so loud. 
Just what was 
that noise...?

## POINTER 676
I don't want to go 
look, though. It's 
too much of a hassle.

## POINTER 677
I heard that your friends 
started to disappear. <PAGE>We've been looking 
but they don't appear 
to be in the city.

## POINTER 678
It's okay. 
It's going to be okay. <PAGE>There aren't any 
good hiding places. 
They'll be found soon.

## POINTER 679
Oh, you're the people 
that came from outside? 
You're so normal.<PAGE>... What? 
Have you been 
here before?

## POINTER 680
I can't believe you're 
really using blastia. <PAGE>...Oh, did I say that before?

## POINTER 681
Nothing good comes 
from using blastia.

## POINTER 682
You people 
better take care 
of that monster.

## POINTER 683
This city is safe 
as long as Krones
protects it. <PAGE>This city will 
remain even if this 
world is destroyed.

## POINTER 684
Is this what we 
deserve? This world 
should be destroyed? <PAGE>We're all finished 
if it's destroyed.

## POINTER 685
I'm pretty sure there were 
still Kritya living on the ground 
when this city was created.<PAGE>Now I remember. 
They built a city on some 
place called Mt. Temza.

## POINTER 686
What? The town on Temza
was destroyed? Oh my...

## POINTER 687
There was a loud noise, 
wasn't there? I've never heard 
a sound like that before...

## POINTER 688
That sounded like a 
tummy rumbling... <PAGE>You don't think so? 
Oh whatever...

## POINTER 689
Elteresse! Uh... Estesse! 
...That was her 
name, right?<PAGE>Oh, the elder told us to 
go look for your friends.

## POINTER 690
Estesse! 
Elte... 
What?

## POINTER 691
Aren't the people down 
on the surface afraid of 
the monster in the sky?

## POINTER 692
Will that thing 
always be up 
there now?

## POINTER 693
The Krityans will be in 
trouble too, if this 
world is destroyed. <PAGE>We have to do something.

## POINTER 694
We have to do something... 
But... 
What can we do?

## POINTER 695
Initially, we Kritya just made 
a town in a remote location, 
away from other people. <PAGE>Then Krones swalloed the 
town. Now we have quite 
the symbiotic relationship.

## POINTER 696
Krones is the 
Entelexeia that 
carries this city.

## POINTER 697
That was loud. 
What was that noise? <PAGE>I wonder if it's going 
to be fun...or not.

## POINTER 698
Is it the sound of festival 
drums? Or a cannon 
salute or something?<PAGE>If it's not something 
fun, then...I wonder 
what it could be?

## POINTER 699
We've looked and we've 
looked. We can't find either 
the girl or the man. <PAGE>They may have gone 
to another island...
