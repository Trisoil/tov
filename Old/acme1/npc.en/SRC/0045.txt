We may not look the same, but 
I suppose humans and Krityans 
really aren't all that different.

## POINTER 4501
Did you know 
there's another Kritya 
town besides Myorzo?

## POINTER 4502
I think that beast 
may be the Adephagos 
depicted on the relief...

## POINTER 4503
I wonder how they 
managed to defeat the 
Adephagos in the past.

## POINTER 4504
Can blastia really 
be used to brighten 
up the night?

## POINTER 4505
If we used blastia to 
brighten up the night, when 
would we be able to sleep?

## POINTER 4506
This town will always 
be safe as long as 
we have the Entelexeia.

## POINTER 4507
I don't like the 
sky like this. 
Not at all.

## POINTER 4508
Why don't you people 
use your blastia to 
kill that monster?

## POINTER 4509
What are you doing 
loitering around at a time 
like this, <STR>(JUD)? <PAGE>You really haven't changed.

## POINTER 4510
You don't remember me? 
I used to invite you out 
to play all the time.

## POINTER 4511
<STR>(JUD), you used 
to walk around 
at night. <PAGE>It was insomnia... 
It must have been hard.

## POINTER 4512
I used to be jealous 
that you couldn't 
sleep at night. <PAGE>I mean, you can play 
around at night too!

## POINTER 4513
Good evening. 
Please take your time.

## POINTER 4514
I'm not certain you will 
find anything of use, 
but please stop by again. <PAGE>Thank you very much.

## POINTER 4515
This is our elder's house. 
It's the largest house 
in the entire town.

## POINTER 4516
The elder's house 
holds a strange, 
old relief.

## POINTER 4517
I'm sure the 
elder is inside.

## POINTER 4518
Did you see the relief in the 
elder's house? Doesn't it look 
like the monster in the sky?

## POINTER 4519
And what might bring 
you here at this late hour?

## POINTER 4520
So you're finally ready to hear 
about the legendary cucumber...
Oh, that's not it?

## POINTER 4521
Youngsters these days just have 
no appreciation for the magnificence 
of the legendary cucumber.

## POINTER 4522
I've said to myself that 
no night can last forever, 
but perhaps I spoke too soon.

## POINTER 4523
I never imagined the day would 
come when I would see the 
Adephagos with my own eyes...

## POINTER 4524
Is that the beast shown 
our ancient relief?

## POINTER 4525
How did people in 
ancient times manage to 
subdue the Adephagos?

## POINTER 4526
You can see the beast in 
the sky even from here. 
How big could it be?

## POINTER 4527
Hey, you. 
Get rid of that 
monster already.

## POINTER 4528
Welcome. This is all just 
stuff in transport, but 
is there anything you want?<PAGE>Thanks.

## POINTER 4529
Good evening. This is all just 
stuff in transport, but 
is there anything you want?

## POINTER 4530
Welcome back. I decided to 
set up shop here instead of sending 
this stuff to the Nor Harbor.

## POINTER 4531
There's no turning back now...
I'm prepared to have my 
bones buried in this Hold.

## POINTER 4532
You need to be more 
careful when traveling by 
night than during the day.

## POINTER 4533
The southern sky is so 
strange... Zaphias must 
be right beneath it.

## POINTER 4534
Go south if you're 
heading for Zaphias.

## POINTER 4535
Lately, I've been getting 
the creepiest feeling when 
it starts to get dark.

## POINTER 4536
Can it really be 
true that the Commandant 
committed treason?

## POINTER 4537
The nights are actually easier for 
me. That way, I don't have to look 
at that awful thing in the sky.

## POINTER 4538
I wonder if that 
monster will still be up 
there when morning comes.

## POINTER 4539
Lots of monsters can see 
in the dark. Watch out if 
you're leaving the Hold.

## POINTER 4540
If you ever feel like 
you're in danger, just 
come back to the Hold.

## POINTER 4541
I'm afraid you'll 
have to sit tight 
until morning.

## POINTER 4542
The Lord of the Plains actually 
calms down a bit at night, but 
I'm still not opening this gate.

## POINTER 4543
I'll bet the blossoms 
at Halure are a sight 
to see at night.

## POINTER 4544
Even if the Lord of the Plains 
doesn't show up, we still 
have to be on our guard. <PAGE>Monsters can see 
well at night.

## POINTER 4545
If things get really bad, we 
can always retreat to Halure. 
The barrier there will protect us.

## POINTER 4546
It's hard to see at night, 
but that monster's somewhere 
up there right now, isn't it?

## POINTER 4547
I sure hope we're safe here.

## POINTER 4548
Thank you. 
We pray for your safety 
during this trip.

## POINTER 4549
Whoa, I must've dozed 
off there for a sec.

## POINTER 4550
I love the night shift. 
It's harder to get 
caught slacking off.

## POINTER 4551
Still, I'd better not 
fool around with the Lord 
of the Plains nearby.

## POINTER 4552
I wonder how much longer 
it'll be until we can start 
leaving the gate open...

## POINTER 4553
*Yawn* I can't seem 
to help getting sleepy 
when it gets dark.

## POINTER 4554
I wonder if anyone's 
going to come relieve 
me anytime soon.

## POINTER 4555
Did something big happen in 
the capital? I guess it doesn't 
really concern me, but...

## POINTER 4556
Here's hoping this 
night's a quiet one.

## POINTER 4557
I wonder if it's all 
right for me to just 
stay at my watch here...

## POINTER 4558
Either way, I sure could 
do with some sleep.

## POINTER 4559
A monster in the sky...? 
I gotta be dreaming...

## POINTER 4560
What, that's no dream? 
Then the monster's real?

## POINTER 4561
No, I'm dreaming, I tell you. 
If I can just get back to sleep, 
it'll be gone when I wake up.

## POINTER 4562
I heard there's a 
different road that'll 
take you to Halure. <PAGE>Unfortunately, I don't 
know where that road is.

## POINTER 4563
This is the soldiers' 
guardhouse. What could you 
possibly need at this hour?

## POINTER 4564
If you don't have a good 
reason for being here, I'll 
have to ask you to leave.

## POINTER 4565
Another day, another 
crisis averted.

## POINTER 4566
What could you possibly 
need at this hour?

## POINTER 4567
I had no idea it 
could get to be 
this dark at night.

## POINTER 4568
I got a little hurt, but it's 
nothing. Just kiss it and it'll 
be all better. Kissy kissy!

## POINTER 4569
This is...OW!
...It's nothing! â™ª

## POINTER 4570
Oooh, this hurts. 
Seriously, I'm in pain.<PAGE>But I'm a man. 
And real men 
don't whine.

## POINTER 4571
How come these two 
are so easygoing...

## POINTER 4572
Some monster almost 
ate me alive! I guess 
that's life, though.<PAGE>Everybody dies sometime. 
There's nothing scary 
about it.

## POINTER 4573
Ohhh, the air here is wonderful. 
My wounds hurt a little, 
but it's so refreshing here!

## POINTER 4574
The answer is: 
get some sleep.<PAGE>It's already night, y'know.

## POINTER 4575
Just the two of us, all alone 
in the dark... Whaddya think? 
Pretty romantic, huh?

## POINTER 4576
Just the two of us, all alone 
in the dark... Still, it just 
doesn't feel romantic at all...<PAGE>I feel nothing...

## POINTER 4577
The craftsmens' preparations 
are finished.

## POINTER 4578
We'll need to be getting 
some rest ourselves 
before too long.

## POINTER 4579
We've built fences, 
and houses... Almost looks 
like a real town now.

## POINTER 4580
I can't imagine any reason 
to go back to Zaphias.

## POINTER 4581
This place is actually starting 
to look like a real town. 
But compared to Zaphias...

## POINTER 4582
I want to get 
back to the city.

## POINTER 4583
I was headed for Torim, 
but <STR>(FRE) ordered 
me assigned here!<PAGE>I hope to meet all of the 
citizens and be remembered!

## POINTER 4584
So this is how 
towns are built!

## POINTER 4585
I think I've had a really 
important experience here.

## POINTER 4586
It's too dangerous at night! 
Are you sure it's okay?

## POINTER 4587
I don't get it. Everyone's all 
happy just because this place looks 
a little like a real town now.

## POINTER 4588
Did they forget 
how much better 
life in Zaphias was?

## POINTER 4589
I suppose I'd be happy 
here if they'd just build 
a nice hot spring.

## POINTER 4590
Wh-what? A hot spring 
wouldn't hurt, right?!

## POINTER 4591
It feels good to 
work, doesn't it?

## POINTER 4592
When I think about what 
I'm doing here, I feel 
like I'm really living.

## POINTER 4593
We're a lot stronger 
than we think, you know?

## POINTER 4594
I never thought we'd 
be able to build 
an entire town.

## POINTER 4595
Just because it's 
night, there's no excuse 
for lax security.

## POINTER 4596
I used to be really frightened 
when night came, but 
that's behind me now.

## POINTER 4597
This is the land of hope, 
Aurnion. They say it 
means "Light of Thawing Snow".<PAGE>It's the perfect name 
for a town built upon a 
great many hardships.

## POINTER 4598
The town's become worthy 
of it's name. Now we have to 
protect it with our lives.

## POINTER 4599
We're getting along with the 
nobles now... Maybe it's because 
we all built this town together.
