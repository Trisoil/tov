## POINTER 400
Welcome back. 
I'm glad to see you're okay.<PAGE>When <STR>(FRE)comes back to the lower 
quarter, we'll have to throw him 
a big party for his promotion!

## POINTER 401
The core's back! 
But you knew 
that, didn't you.<PAGE><STR>(YUR), you're really the one 
who got the core back, right?<PAGE><STR>(FRE) kind of 
filled me in.

## POINTER 402
A lot of people have 
been getting sick since 
the sky went all funny.<PAGE>Especially children... 
They tire so quickly when 
they go out to play.

## POINTER 403
Apparently the people 
that left Zaphias escaped 
to the port town.

## POINTER 404
Is the young lady 
feeling better? Don't 
push yourselves too hard.

## POINTER 405
I'll go and make you some nice, 
hot soup. If you're going back 
out you'll need your nutrition!

## POINTER 406
<STR>(YUR)...!<PAGE>I knew it. 
I knew that could 
never happen to you.

## POINTER 407
Your friend was saying such 
terrible things, everyone 
was worried about you. <PAGE>Hurry up and go show Ted
you're all right, won't you?

## POINTER 408
Looks like <STR>(FRE)'s toiling 
away as usual. You'll be going 
too, won't you, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 409
Take care, now.

## POINTER 410
<STR>(YUR), you gotta 
get yourself outside.<PAGE>The old lady'll give you a 
spanking if you just keep 
hanging around.

## POINTER 411
Ow, ow, ow... 
The old lady's ruthless.<PAGE>I was just sitting out back, 
taking a little break. Well, I was 
sort of slacking off, but still...

## POINTER 412
Did you see the old lady?<PAGE>I bet she whipped you good!

## POINTER 413
My wife was so worried 
about you, <STR>(YUR), she 
gave ME a licking! Owww...

## POINTER 414
What are you doing back 
here? After everybody 
helped you get away...

## POINTER 415
You're looking for <STR>(FRE), right? 
So go on already!

## POINTER 416
...So it's the wanted man.<PAGE>What are you doing? 
Everyone was so worried.

## POINTER 417
You may have brought 
this upon yourself, but 
I feel for <STR>(FRE).<PAGE>I mean, now it's job 
to arrest you, <STR>(YUR)...

## POINTER 418
<STR>(FRE)'s so famous now, 
even we hear about it. Try 
and keep up with him, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 419
Maybe I'll ask for <STR>(FRE)'s 
autograph when he comes back.

## POINTER 420
It's a state of total 
emergency, and the Knights 
are no help at all.<PAGE>Quell the chaos? Hah! 
They're running around as 
scared as the citizens.

## POINTER 421
<STR>(FRE) came to tell us 
about the danger in Zaphias.<PAGE>He evacuated the citizens to the 
port town. I swear, <STR>(FRE)'s the only 
one actually doing his job.

## POINTER 422
That weird thing with the sky 
seems to have fixed itself.<PAGE>The evacuees won't come 
back for a while, but we gotta 
fix up the lower quarter.

## POINTER 423
The people who remained need a 
place to relax, so I plan to keep 
the inn and tavern running.

## POINTER 424
The Knights are handling 
the capital's security.<PAGE>We should be thankful 
they took charge.<PAGE>We're helpless without 
the barrier.

## POINTER 425
There's no Emperor, the council's 
finished...and now the Commandant 
of the Knights has rebelled?<PAGE>Who's going to take 
control of the chaos now?

## POINTER 426
They say <STR>(FRE) led all the 
refugees to build a new town.<PAGE>I'm sure he didn't 
plan to build a town...
it just happened, right?

## POINTER 427
When everything's back to normal, 
<STR>(FRE) will come back to Zaphias.<PAGE>He's from the lower quarter, after all.

## POINTER 428
Ho ho ho ho!♪ 
You sure are a looker, young lady. 
Fancy a drink with this old man?<PAGE>...Hey, you're a guy?!

## POINTER 429
Ain't nothing fun about 
drinking with guys. 
Go away.

## POINTER 430
Hey, buddy, listen to this...there 
was a gorgeous young gal here 
at the inn the other day...<PAGE>But it turned out to be 
some guy with long hair!

## POINTER 431
Wait...it was you, <STR>(YUR)!<PAGE>Real men have short hair! 
Go cut it! It's so confusing!

## POINTER 432
Drink booze, don't let 
the booze drink you!<PAGE>Ha ha ha ha ha ha! 
Yeah, yeah... 
I know, I know!

## POINTER 433
I ain't drunk. 
Ain't drunk at all! 
Ha ha ha ha ha...ugggh...

## POINTER 434
Damn, look at all of you. 
If the young lady wants to 
sit with me, that's fine.

## POINTER 435
We'll go fifty-fifty on 
the drinks and snacks.

## POINTER 436
If you plan on going 
towards the port, you should 
probably wait a while.<PAGE>This time of year, passage to the 
north of Deidon Hold is frequently 
blocked due to monster attacks.

## POINTER 437
The monsters migrate 
throughout the year.<PAGE>So the risk of monster attacks 
varies depending on what season 
it is and where you are.

## POINTER 438
Are you the...? <PAGE>There's been quite a 
fuss about you, 
you know.

## POINTER 439
The mistress of the inn 
certainly keeps her husband in 
check with those beatings...<PAGE>She's tough! I bet she 
could handle those monsters 
outside the city.

## POINTER 440
After all that fuss and 
leaving the city, now 
you come back again?<PAGE>Go on! Run away, already! 
The knights'll come around 
again, you know!

## POINTER 441
If the mistress finds you 
here, she'll make you sorry 
you ever came back.<PAGE>I'm telling you, she 
can be really scary.

## POINTER 442
The Empire may have the power 
in Zaphias, but it's different 
outside the city.<PAGE>There are towns in 
which the guilds are 
much more influential.

## POINTER 443
The guilds started as vocational 
organizations formed by people who 
 took issue with the Empire's rule.<PAGE>That feeling of opposition 
remains today, and the guilds
don't like the Empire at all.

## POINTER 444
This man and I really 
hit it off while talking 
with each other. <PAGE>We decided to 
travel together.

## POINTER 445
The freedom that comes with 
traveling alone is fine, but having 
companions is nice too.<PAGE>The same old scenery can look very 
different when you have someone 
to share your feelings with.

## POINTER 446
Why?<PAGE>There's no point in setting 
 off in a hurry if we'll just 
get stopped at the Hold.

## POINTER 447
This guy says he came 
from a town in Tolbyccia.<PAGE>I'm about to set off on a 
journey myself, so I'm asking 
him a bunch of questions.

## POINTER 448
The mistress of the inn sure 
is funny. We totally forgot to 
talk about our travels.<PAGE>That's some 
backhand 
she has.

## POINTER 449
Well, well... 
You got yourself 
quite a beauty there.<PAGE>Did you use the fountain blastia 
as an excuse to go to the royal 
quarter and pick up women?

## POINTER 450
The guilds aren't just anti-Empire
organizations, they're autonomous 
groups seeking freedom...<PAGE>...Or so this guy here tells me.

## POINTER 451
The Guild Union ties 
all the guilds together.<PAGE>Even I know that.

## POINTER 452
Talking to this guy here, 
I've made up my mind to travel. <PAGE>We're going to 
set out together.

## POINTER 453
It'll be reassuring to be with 
someone so used to the road.

## POINTER 454
Move, move! 
That's a pretty dumb 
place to stand.<PAGE>You're in my way! My customers 
are waiting for their food!

## POINTER 455
<STR>(YUR)! 
Come on, you can't 
be that slow.<PAGE>Ted left ages ago. 
Stop twiddling your thumbs, 
<STR>(YUR), and get a move on!

## POINTER 456
<STR>(YUR), you big dummy!<PAGE>I was so worried about you! 
Waaaaah!

## POINTER 457
...Who's this girl?<PAGE>Hmph. When I grow up, 
I'll be just as...

## POINTER 458
<STR>(YUR), you're back?<PAGE>Tee-hee!♪

## POINTER 459
If only you'd told me you 
were coming back, I would 
have fixed up your bed...

## POINTER 460
I don't care if there
's a bounty out for you. 
I trust you, <STR>(YUR).<PAGE>I'll be waiting 
for you here when 
your journey's done.

## POINTER 461
You're not...you know...
with those girls, right?

## POINTER 462
...MORE girls...?

## POINTER 463
I'm busy 
with my chores! <PAGE>I don't have any time 
to play with 
you, <STR>(YUR)! Hmph!

## POINTER 464
<STR>(YUR)... 
You're going to save 
us, aren't you?<PAGE>That's why you 
came back, right?

## POINTER 465
Going outside makes me so 
tired I stay inside all day. <PAGE>Ted went out to play...
I wonder if he's all right?

## POINTER 466
This is the City of 
Blossoms, Halure.

## POINTER 467
Did you come to 
see our flowers, too?<PAGE>I'm afraid the Tree of 
Halure has withered...

## POINTER 468
How could the Tree have died?!

## POINTER 469
I've never seen the Tree 
like this in my entire life...

## POINTER 470
Welcome. 
May I help you?

## POINTER 471
Thank you very much! 
Come again!

## POINTER 472
Hey! Listen! The Tree 
of Halure died!

## POINTER 473
Hey, mister, isn't 
there any way to 
revive our Tree?

## POINTER 474
I always felt so relieved and 
at peace when I looked 
around at this city's flowers. <PAGE>I can't believe 
this could happen...

## POINTER 475
Every time I look up 
at the flowers at night, 
I'm just filled with sadness.

## POINTER 476
The beautiful flowers 
would always bring 
me so much peace... <PAGE>I'm just lost with 
the Tree like this...

## POINTER 477
Ohhh... 
Why am I so 
depressed...?

## POINTER 478
Hmm... There must be some 
way to bring the Tree of 
Halure back to life...

## POINTER 479
I don't have the 
knowledge to look 
into what caused it.

## POINTER 480
It's the season for flower 
viewing, but there aren't 
any flowers to view. <PAGE>And monsters are attacking...
It's too much...

## POINTER 481
Flower viewing 
is the least of 
our problems...

## POINTER 482
I can't believe monsters 
attacked... Why isn't the 
barrier blastia working?!

## POINTER 483
I don't want to be eaten!

## POINTER 484
You have a talented 
healer with you there.<PAGE>She healed all of our 
wounds so quickly.

## POINTER 485
Thank you so much. 
Sorry I didn't thank 
you earlier.

## POINTER 486
That lady's awesome! 
She healed everyone 
in no time!

## POINTER 487
This is the mayor's house. <PAGE>The mayor is 
such a kind man.

## POINTER 488
If you follow the 
hill up, you'll arrive 
at the Tree of Halure. <PAGE>Of course, it's dead now...

## POINTER 489
Thank you for 
healing everyone.<PAGE>I hope the barrier gets 
back to normal soon...

## POINTER 490
Welcome. Will you 
be staying? 
That will be 150 Gald.

## POINTER 491
<inn>Will you be staying?

## POINTER 492
We hope you 
enjoyed your stay. 
Please come again.

## POINTER 493
How is your 
friend doing? <PAGE>Don't worry about a thing. 
Stay as long as you like.

## POINTER 494
Are you going somewhere? 
Or are you just getting in?

## POINTER 495
Oh dear oh dear. 
I never thought I'd 
see this happen...

## POINTER 496
You there! Travellers! Do you 
happen to know a good mage who 
could fix a barrier blastia?

## POINTER 497
The Tree of Halure used 
to protect our town.

## POINTER 498
Is this town finished?

## POINTER 499
Now Halure is safe, too.
