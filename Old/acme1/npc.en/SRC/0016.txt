## POINTER 1600
I took a day trip to 
check out the tower that 
showed up on Ilyccia.<PAGE>It looks like an 
ancient relic.

## POINTER 1601
If I were to guess, 
I'd say it was about 
1000 years old...<PAGE>You'd know it 
if you saw it.

## POINTER 1602
I'm so totally in love with 
this waitress right now.

## POINTER 1603
I'm not going to 
run away just because 
of some monsters.

## POINTER 1604
I'm not going anywhere,
even if the barrier fails.<PAGE>I'm not taking my eyes
off the waitress.

## POINTER 1605
If I can die looking 
at her beautiful face, 
I can die happy.

## POINTER 1606
I don't care about 
a fight between the 
Empire and the guilds.

## POINTER 1607
I'm head over heels 
for this waitress.

## POINTER 1608
O, that my passionate gaze would 
reach her! That my song of pure love 
would resound in her heart!

## POINTER 1609
Uhh...
It's not working, is it?

## POINTER 1610
I used to be part 
of Siren's Fang, 
but it's gone now.<PAGE>It's a little sad, but I had a 
beautiful encounter there, so 
it doesn't matter anymore.

## POINTER 1611
It's a world of only men on 
the seas. There's nobody as 
beautiful as her out there.

## POINTER 1612
I will pour my heart and 
soul into this song.<PAGE>I looove you, I looove you!
My mouth and your mouth!
It's mouth-to-mouth♪

## POINTER 1613
I looove you...♪
Oops...
Went a little off-key there...

## POINTER 1614
That Krityan waitress... 
Her smile is so cute... 
I just can't go back to work.

## POINTER 1615
I know my boss will 
be furious with me if 
I don't get back.<PAGE>But I just can't leave.

## POINTER 1616
Can a Krityan and a 
human get married?<PAGE>I hope so. 
I really hope so. ♪

## POINTER 1617
So? Do you know if they can?

## POINTER 1618
It's so sad that the Don
is gone, but I'm sad that 
I'm so in love with her.<PAGE>It's a complicated feeling, and 
I can't hold it in any more.

## POINTER 1619
I'm feel like I'm 
about to burst. 
About to explode!<PAGE>What should I do?

## POINTER 1620
This waitress 
smiles the most 
beautiful smile at me.<PAGE>I'm so happy, so 
very happy.

## POINTER 1621
But she won't tell me 
her name for some reason.

## POINTER 1622
The waitress won't look 
at me at all lately. 
I'm so sad.<PAGE>What should I do?

## POINTER 1623
Hey, bartender. 
How about some 
advice on love?<PAGE>You're not the bartender?

## POINTER 1624
Even if the end of the 
world is near, this love 
will never change.<PAGE>Even if the world becomes 
our enemy, my love for her 
will never change.

## POINTER 1625
These passionate feelings 
inside me are just going 
around and around...

## POINTER 1626
*Hic!*
Whuuuh...? Hey, I'm havin' 
a good time over here...

## POINTER 1627
A stiff drink in the 
afternoon is the best!

## POINTER 1628
Have you heard? 
The barrier failed and 
monsters attacked.

## POINTER 1629
Oh... You already 
knew that...?

## POINTER 1630
Have you heard? 
The barrier was fixed.

## POINTER 1631
Have you heard? 
We were about to clash 
with the Knights.

## POINTER 1632
They say Barbos betrayed us.

## POINTER 1633
That Ragou guy's 
a piece of crap.

## POINTER 1634
I heard there's going to 
be a treaty of friendship 
signed with the guilds.

## POINTER 1635
Now some hideous 
monster attacked 
from out of the sky.

## POINTER 1636
I hear Belius died.

## POINTER 1637
They say the Don died.

## POINTER 1638
Apparently Zaphias
is in chaos.

## POINTER 1639
I hear a giant monster 
appeared in the sky.

## POINTER 1640
I've conquered 
countless obstacles
to get where I am.<PAGE>That' s why I'm not 
afraid of any monsters.

## POINTER 1641
In my opinion, there 
is nothing rougher 
than being alive.

## POINTER 1642
Even without a barrier, 
when you get to be as old as 
me, you can still live on.<PAGE>I'm not afraid of 
any monsters.

## POINTER 1643
What scares me most 
is my cowardly soul 
that's scared of monsters.

## POINTER 1644
There's a long history 
of hostility between the 
Empire and the guilds.<PAGE>It might not be too bad 
to finally settle things.

## POINTER 1645
On the surface, they make it seem 
like a cold war, but they really 
just slipped into a stalemate.

## POINTER 1646
The Union doesn't 
tolerate treason. This 
is the end for Barbos.

## POINTER 1647
One of the five master guilds is gone. 
Now the balance of power has changed. 
Something's bound to happen.

## POINTER 1648
I wonder where our 
world's headed next?<PAGE>We won't know until 
we get there.

## POINTER 1649
In the end, predictions are 
just like unsurveyed maps.

## POINTER 1650
First monsters, then the Knights, 
then Barbos... Now another 
monster. This town is cursed.

## POINTER 1651
I wonder if there really 
is something to the town...

## POINTER 1652
Sounds like things 
are getting stirred 
up in Desier.<PAGE>I wonder if my friend in 
Nordopolica is all right.

## POINTER 1653
They say no news 
is good news... 
But I'm still worried.

## POINTER 1654
I knew this day would 
come eventually.<PAGE>Everyone had to be 
prepared for it. Even 
the Don is human.

## POINTER 1655
The death of a great 
man will drain the 
energy of this town.<PAGE>But, in time, it will be the 
source of great strength in 
propelling ourselves forward.

## POINTER 1656
I'm sure the people of 
Zaphias are struggling.<PAGE>Not everyone is strong 
enough for the guilds.

## POINTER 1657
Life is hard. There will 
always be things to trip you up 
in whatever path you chose.

## POINTER 1658
I can't believe something 
so ominous actually 
exists in this world.

## POINTER 1659
It's so gross... 
But we can't just 
look away..

## POINTER 1660
The people will not 
lose to that monster, no 
matter how horrible it is!

## POINTER 1661
We have the courage 
to stay strong 
and fight.

## POINTER 1662
Who made this world
into a place where one
can't even eat in peace?!<PAGE>Damn it! 
I blame the Union!

## POINTER 1663
Would you let me 
eat in peace?!

## POINTER 1664
What?! The barrier 
got fixed?<PAGE>Then I didn't have 
to eat so fast...

## POINTER 1665
I was in such a 
hurry to eat, I didn't 
get to enjoy my food...

## POINTER 1666
What?! The situation with the 
Knights is about to blow up? 
Just let me eat in peace!

## POINTER 1667
I'll help out when 
I'm done eating. 
Just wait a sec.

## POINTER 1668
What?! They took care of the 
problem with the Knights? Then 
I didn't have to eat so fast...

## POINTER 1669
This might be the only chance 
for me to take my time.

## POINTER 1670
I'm going to eat while I can. 
Bartender! Food! Bring me food!

## POINTER 1671
It looks like I can 
eat in peace today.

## POINTER 1672
Bartender! 
Food! 
Bring me food!

## POINTER 1673
What? Monsters again?!
Just let me eat in peace!

## POINTER 1674
The Don will never eat
a meal again, will he...?

## POINTER 1675
No matter how much I eat, 
I just don't feel satisfied.

## POINTER 1676
Do the people in Zaphias
have food to eat?

## POINTER 1677
At this point I might 
as well chow down on 
everything in sight!

## POINTER 1678
The barrier disappeared. 
How should I respond 
to this situation?

## POINTER 1679
There's no way 
the monsters could 
bring it down, right?

## POINTER 1680
They say someone tampered 
with the barrier blastia.

## POINTER 1681
We'll have to put the barrier 
blastia under much heavier 
guard from now on.

## POINTER 1682
Even our mighty barrier 
won't protect us against 
the Imperial Knights.

## POINTER 1683
If only we had a barrier 
that worked against people.

## POINTER 1684
Was the barrier failure 
Barbos's work, too?

## POINTER 1685
Seems like there's a 
good chance for that.

## POINTER 1686
The barrier is stable for another day. 
As long as we have the barrier, 
the town is at peace.

## POINTER 1687
The barrier is a symbol 
of this town's peace.

## POINTER 1688
The monsters penetrated 
the barrier so easily. 
Are we even safe?

## POINTER 1689
Is the barrier that 
vulnerable, or are these 
not normal monsters...?

## POINTER 1690
The barrier failure, the monsters 
attacking... So much for the 
fairytale about barrier safety.<PAGE>Sure, we're safer with it, 
but it's no guarantee.

## POINTER 1691
Even the peace we have right now
is only a temporary thing.

## POINTER 1692
Barriers protect us from monsters, 
but they can't protect us from 
the evil of other humans.<PAGE>The Don protected 
us from that.

## POINTER 1693
What you can protect, and 
how you protect it... It 
changes with the situation.

## POINTER 1694
The barrier in Zaphias
is acting up.<PAGE>If you put all your trust in the barrier, 
it could hurt you in the end.

## POINTER 1695
The people of Zaphias
must be very worried...

## POINTER 1696
It seems that the 
barrier is of no use against 
the flying monster. <PAGE>The days where the barrier 
reigned supreme are now over.

## POINTER 1697
There was a time when people 
thought they could live in peace 
as long as there was a barrier...

## POINTER 1698
The time may have come 
where we need to find a way 
to live without the barrier.

## POINTER 1699
The times are starting 
to change.
