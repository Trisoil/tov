## POINTER 1700
Young people nowadays! 
Striding into bars in 
the middle of the day.

## POINTER 1701
Me? I can come in 
whenever I like.
I'm an old man.

## POINTER 1702
Such a fuss over one or 
two barriers going bad.

## POINTER 1703
I just don't understand 
kids these days.

## POINTER 1704
No matter how much the 
Empire may struggle, they're 
no match for the Don.

## POINTER 1705
He's the strongest man I 
know. Next to me, of course.

## POINTER 1706
Barbos doesn't know 
his place.

## POINTER 1707
What he needs is a lesson. 
And I'll smack some 
learning into his head!

## POINTER 1708
People from the Empire
have begun to show 
their faces around here.

## POINTER 1709
I despise the Empire.

## POINTER 1710
What in the world is 
that creature in the sky? 
I got a bad feeling...

## POINTER 1711
My bad feelings always 
turn out to be right.

## POINTER 1712
The Knights helped 
us repair our bridge.<PAGE>I guess there are some 
decent Knights, after all.

## POINTER 1713
It's the same with the guilds. 
You got some decent guys, 
and some not-so-decent.

## POINTER 1714
All of Dahngrest
is in mourning.

## POINTER 1715
But it won't last long. 
That's not what the Don
would have wanted.

## POINTER 1716
The young are still 
in despair over the 
Don's death.<PAGE>It just goes to show
what a huge influence
that old man had.

## POINTER 1717
The young people 
must truly stand firm now 
that the Don has passed on.

## POINTER 1718
If only I were twenty 
years younger... I'd take 
that monster out quick.

## POINTER 1719
Ohh, my back...

## POINTER 1720
I will not be 
outdone by kids!

## POINTER 1721
I'm just here for a visit, 
and the barrier disappears! 
Talk about bad luck...

## POINTER 1722
I'm just really unlucky. 
Yeah, really unlucky.

## POINTER 1723
The barrier was fixed... 
Now I can breathe a 
sigh of relief.

## POINTER 1724
I can have a good 
drink here. Maybe my 
luck has turned a little.

## POINTER 1725
Sometimes the solidarity 
of the guilds
can 
be a painful thing.

## POINTER 1726
People with conviction 
who get bound up by rules 
can often do crazy things.

## POINTER 1727
Barbos is only doing 
what he thinks is right.

## POINTER 1728
Don't like it? 
Your only choice is to resist 
with a show of force.

## POINTER 1729
It's so nice to enjoy a 
good meal while listening 
to this beautiful music.

## POINTER 1730
Hey, why don't you take 
it easy and enjoy a nice 
meal once in a while?

## POINTER 1731
That monster in 
flames seems like it's 
looking for something.

## POINTER 1732
Do you think it has some 
kind of intelligence?
No, that's impossible.

## POINTER 1733
There's going to be a lot 
of casualties if it comes to 
facing Palestralle head-on.

## POINTER 1734
Belius, from Palestralle, 
is just as important to 
the guilds as the Don is.

## POINTER 1735
Belius and the Don... 
Everyone knew and respected them,
and now, one after the other...

## POINTER 1736
They say Leviathan's Claw
is pulling the strings.

## POINTER 1737
The kindling that started 
in the Empire looks like it 
will spread to the world.<PAGE>It's times like these that try 
the unity of the guilds.

## POINTER 1738
We all have to work 
together to prepare for 
unforseen situations.

## POINTER 1739
The Imperial Knights and 
the Council are weak, 
and there's no Emperor.<PAGE>Now's the time for the guilds
to take over the Empire.

## POINTER 1740
This is the perfect time 
to overthrow the Empire. 
But no one's standing up.<PAGE>If only the Don
were here...

## POINTER 1741
If the Union would band 
together, there'd be 
nothing to be afraid of.<PAGE>Let's kill monster in 
the sky already.

## POINTER 1742
Our true enemy 
is the Empire, 
not that rabble!

## POINTER 1743
To fight or not to fight. 
That is the question.<PAGE>...But thinking about it 
doesn't bring any answers...

## POINTER 1744
What would be best is if 
the monsters went away while 
I'm thinking about it.

## POINTER 1745
The monsters went away 
while I was still wondering 
whether to fight or not.<PAGE>I guess that's what I was 
asking for, but...I'm 
a little disappointed.

## POINTER 1746
I'm a little disappointed I didn't 
get to show what I can do.

## POINTER 1747
To join the fight with 
the Imperial Knights or not. 
That is the question.<PAGE>...I really don't 
want to go.

## POINTER 1748
What would be best is 
if it all ended while 
I'm thinking about it.

## POINTER 1749
Barbos should be left 
to the Imperial Knights.<PAGE>There's no reason to 
fight pointless battles.

## POINTER 1750
I'll just drink and 
sleep well tonight.

## POINTER 1751
I hear the Knights 
defeated Barbos.<PAGE>I'm a little disappointed 
I didn't get a chance to 
show my true strength.

## POINTER 1752
I always end up regretting 
all the wrong choices 
I keep making.

## POINTER 1753
To support the friendship 
treaty or not...<PAGE>I see the pros in 
supporting it, but I see 
the cons too. Hmm...

## POINTER 1754
It's just easier to go with 
whichever side wins out...

## POINTER 1755
There's a huge monster 
near the bridge?<PAGE>No way. 
There's nothing 
that I can do.

## POINTER 1756
Is that huge monster 
still out there?

## POINTER 1757
So the Imperial Knights used 
their hoplon blastia to chase 
that huge monster away.<PAGE>I'm disappointed that I 
couldn't use my strength 
to chase it away myself.

## POINTER 1758
I failed to seize 
the opportunity to show 
my true strength.<PAGE>What? Palestralle? 
Th-that's out of 
my league...

## POINTER 1759
The Don died while I was 
just sitting around worrying.

## POINTER 1760
I'm such a failure...

## POINTER 1761
...I've been reborn. 
I will protect this town.<PAGE>No matter what happens, 
I will not waver. 
I will not run away.

## POINTER 1762
I know I said I 
wouldn't run away...<PAGE>...But I'm still a 
little scared...

## POINTER 1763
What's with that huge 
monster? Th-that's 
against the rules, right?<PAGE>You're telling me 
to fight that thing?

## POINTER 1764
I-I have no choice. I'll see 
how things go from here for a 
little while, then I'll join in.

## POINTER 1765
Th-that monster still 
scares me a little, but 
I'm going to do it!

## POINTER 1766
O-okay then, so...
How should I fight 
that thing...?

## POINTER 1767
The back room is for 
VIPs only. You can't get 
in there. Please leave.

## POINTER 1768
Welcome. 
This is Store #1 of Fortune's 
Market headquarters. ∀

## POINTER 1769
Thank you very much. 
Please come back any time.

## POINTER 1770
<con>

## POINTER 1771
No, no, no. 
You can't come in.

## POINTER 1772
No way, no how!

## POINTER 1773
I'm gonna join Fortune's 
Market when I grow up!

## POINTER 1774
A merchant needs to know 
his math. I'm gonna start 
studying right now!

## POINTER 1775
Wh-what's so scary about a bunch 
of monsters?! This is our town
! 
I'm gonna fight 'em off, too!

## POINTER 1776
Um...uh... 
How do people 
fight, anyway?

## POINTER 1777
The Don was cool! 
He's amazing!! I-I'm still 
gonna be a merchant, though.

## POINTER 1778
I have to study!

## POINTER 1779
Hey, is it true the Empire's 
coming to attack us? 
W-we'll be okay, right?

## POINTER 1780
You can't be a merchant 
and be scared of the Empire
and the Imperial Knights!

## POINTER 1781
That guy from the Imperial 
Knights! What's his name? 
<STR>(FRE)?! He was so cool!!

## POINTER 1782
B-but I'm still 
gonna be a merchant!<PAGE>It's not like I 
wanna be a knight, 
or anything!

## POINTER 1783
I don't like the 
Knights, but that guy 
<STR>(FRE) is so cool!

## POINTER 1784
I haven't given up on 
being part of a guild... 
It's just... Oh, never mind...

## POINTER 1785
Hey, are the Empire
and the guilds really 
gonna be friendly now?

## POINTER 1786
I dunno... 
It's hard for 
me to believe.

## POINTER 1787
D-did you see it? That thing 
outside? Wh-what is it? I never knew 
there were such huge monsters!!

## POINTER 1788
It's sooo huuuge! 
What are they gonna 
do about it?!

## POINTER 1789
I'm helping out in 
Fortune's Market
for Dahngrest's sake.

## POINTER 1790
I live in this town, too, 
so I'm gonna do my best!

## POINTER 1791
Everyone's so sad that 
the Don died... What's 
going to happen now?

## POINTER 1792
Can a kid like me 
do anything to help...?

## POINTER 1793
Everyone says things 
are crazy all over 
the world right now.

## POINTER 1794
But... 
I'm gonna do 
what I can!

## POINTER 1795
I won't run. 
I won't run, no matter 
what happens!

## POINTER 1796
Why? 
Because this...
This is my town.

## POINTER 1797
Welcome. 
This is Fortune's 
Market Store #1. ∀

## POINTER 1798
Thank you very much. 
We're always open! ∀

## POINTER 1799
Welcome. This is Fortune's 
Market Store #1. We got new 
stuff in, so take a look.
