## POINTER 4600
Back in the lower 
quarter, they hated 
us just for being.

## POINTER 4601
Life in this town has become much 
easier. Now if only things beyond 
the barrier would quiet down...

## POINTER 4602
Maybe I'm asking 
for too much.

## POINTER 4603
If people put their 
minds to it, they really 
can do anything.

## POINTER 4604
Living in this town 
taught me that.

## POINTER 4605
I loved life in Zaphias, 
but now I prefer it here.

## POINTER 4606
It's especially nice 
when <STR>(FRE) passes by.

## POINTER 4607
<STR>(FRE) made it, so if you 
ask me, they should 
have called it <STR>(FRE)town.

## POINTER 4608
Thanks to the Knights, 
it's even safe to get out of the house 
and walk around at night.<PAGE>Back in Zaphias, 
I never even thought about 
how much the Knights meant to us.

## POINTER 4609
The more time you spend in cruel 
conditions, the more you realize 
what's really important in life... <PAGE>What I feel for the 
Knights... Could it be... 
Love?!

## POINTER 4610
Please come see us again.

## POINTER 4611
Come back anytime.

## POINTER 4612
It's gotten quite late, 
you know. Let's set out 
again in the morning.

## POINTER 4613
Give my regards 
to <STR>(EST).

## POINTER 4614
Step right up, come one, come all!
Feast your eyes on these wares!
You can't buy stuff like this in the Empire!

## POINTER 4615
Altosk's amazing... 
Did you see how they took 
out all those monsters?

## POINTER 4616
Dahngrest is a city of guilds.
It's probably the freest place on earth!♪

## POINTER 4617
All those stuffy old strait-laced Empire types 
should go back and huddle together 
on their own little continent.♪

## POINTER 4618
Dahngrest is the best. 
With all the guilds banded together, 
monsters are no match for us!♪

## POINTER 4619
The Don's dead...? Can you believe it? What's 
going to happen now...?

## POINTER 4620
...H-help! 
M-my legs gave out...

## POINTER 4621
Sir... You might want to stop 
goggling at everything. It's obvious 
you're not from around here.<PAGE>I don't know where you're 
from, but not everyone in 
Dahngrest is nice.

## POINTER 4622
The Empire has it 
pretty rough, too.

## POINTER 4623
Hey now, no window shopping! 
Come on and drop some Gald!

## POINTER 4624
Apparently, something happened 
in Nordopolica, but I'm going 
to keep doing business here.

## POINTER 4625
We will keep the peace 
here in Dahngrest.

## POINTER 4626
We will keep the peace at 
night here in Dahngrest.

## POINTER 4627
I can't believe monsters 
would show up in town... 
I bet the Empire's behind it.

## POINTER 4628
The barrier failed!
This is a disaster!

## POINTER 4629
This ain't good at all! 
The smart thing to 
do would be to run!

## POINTER 4630
No, no...I didn't run! 
We fought all proper-like. 
Me too! Seriously!

## POINTER 4631
What, are we all supposed hold 
hands with the Knights and 
play pattycake? What a joke!

## POINTER 4632
This ain't just bad... It's 
really bad! Nothing to do but 
make a break for it again!

## POINTER 4633
What am I supposed to do?

## POINTER 4634
I'm at my wits' end.

## POINTER 4635
I've been on a traveling to find 
powerful monsters, but the tornado to 
the north has stopped my progress.

## POINTER 4636
There's nothing one man can 
do about that tornado. It's 
unfortunate, but can't be helped.

## POINTER 4637
So... What monsters should 
I go hunting next? <PAGE>I'll think about it tonight.

## POINTER 4638
At this rate, we could even 
take on the Empire...

## POINTER 4639
If Barbos was still alive, 
he'd take that thing down 
before you could blink.

## POINTER 4640
And then make mincemeat 
out of the Empire!

## POINTER 4641
Ain't nobody getting 
friendly with the Empire

## POINTER 4642
Not that it 
would beat me in 
a fight, mind you.

## POINTER 4643
Is it true
Belius died?

## POINTER 4644
Not that I really care.

## POINTER 4645
Wh-what shall we do?
If we stay in this town any longer,
we're going to be in danger.

## POINTER 4646
The people here 
are nervous. 
What is it now?

## POINTER 4647
Huh? Hey! You all! 
Don't just sit there 
doing nothing!

## POINTER 4648
The Knights aren't gonna 
be any help! We'll protect 
Dahngrest ourselves!

## POINTER 4649
You want to see the 
Don? He just took off, 
leading some forces.

## POINTER 4650
Where are they going? 
Who knows? No clue.

## POINTER 4651
Where are they keeping 
that Knight they caught? 
I want to go laugh at him.

## POINTER 4652
Monsters are evil, so we 
kill 'em! That's the mission 
of the Hunting Blades.

## POINTER 4653
Union headquarters are up ahead.
Did you want to see the Don?<PAGE>I'm sure he's asleep 
at this hour.

## POINTER 4654
Of course, even the 
Don sleeps at night.<PAGE>You know the elderly 
get to bed early.

## POINTER 4655
I hear the chief went 
a little wild in Nordopolica.

## POINTER 4656
I hope Nan and Tison
are doing all right.

## POINTER 4657
Whoa, whoa! What 
the hell is this? 
What's going on?

## POINTER 4658
Empire types aren't good 
for anything. That goes for 
the Imperial Knights, too.

## POINTER 4659
This is bad. It's 
dangerous to get on 
Palestralle's bad side.

## POINTER 4660
I wonder what the 
Don would do...

## POINTER 4661
...For a monster, that 
thing's just a little 
too big to feel real.
Oh well. 
We gotta take it down 
like any other monster...!

## POINTER 4662
Did you get to meet the Don? 
Now that's what I call a great man!

## POINTER 4663
I mean, you know... 
He's the Don!

## POINTER 4664
The fun never 
ends in this town.

## POINTER 4665
Of course, that's exactly 
why I like Dahngrest.

## POINTER 4666
Peace is nice.

## POINTER 4667
The Don wasn't 
a bad guy. Why'd 
he have to die?

## POINTER 4668
I never thought the 
Don would pass on 
before this old man...

## POINTER 4669
To live such a 
fruitful life and 
have it end that way...

## POINTER 4670
Zaphias Brew, Ehmead Snow,
Dese... They're good drinks
that will really quench your thirst.

## POINTER 4671
I'll bring out the really good 
stuff when that happens!

## POINTER 4672
Are things all right outside? 
I'll go out there if anyone 
needs help.

## POINTER 4673
The customers just won't 
stop complaining lately.

## POINTER 4674
They complain so much I want 
to start complaining myself.

## POINTER 4675
What would you like? 
Cider? Soda? Milkshake?<PAGE>Or maybe rain water is good 
enough for you? We also have hot 
miso soup, if that's your fancy.

## POINTER 4676
What? A monster 
convered in flames?
You delirious?

## POINTER 4677
Yeah, I'm troubled, 
but I ain't about to say 
anything stupid like you.

## POINTER 4678
I'm just a mercenary. 
Why'd I even help 
repair that bridge?

## POINTER 4679
Well, I guess it would 
be pretty inconvenient 
without a bridge.

## POINTER 4680
The Don was the Don, right to the end.

## POINTER 4681
Ooooh... *Burp!*

## POINTER 4682
Nothing is solved by 
drinking. I know that.<PAGE>But I can't get by 
without this stuff.

## POINTER 4683
The folks at this tavern... 
It's always the same old faces.

## POINTER 4684
I guess there's just 
a lot of people with 
time on their hands.

## POINTER 4685
Someone let slip that 
Leviathan's Claw
is making a move.

## POINTER 4686
Nothing good ever comes 
when Leviathan's Claw makes a move.<PAGE>'Course, that's exactly 
what they're going for.

## POINTER 4687
A good drink is called for sometimes.
But don't go drinking too much.

## POINTER 4688
That bird monster's 
gonna be a problem.<PAGE>I don't care how much trust 
I regain, I don't want to 
go up against that thing.

## POINTER 4689
Get another guild if 
you want that thing dead.

## POINTER 4690
Don't talk to me 
or you'll get a whipping.

## POINTER 4691
Don't talk to me 
or I'll make you eat worms.

## POINTER 4692
Don't talk to me 
or I'll make soup out of you.

## POINTER 4693
Don't talk to me 
or you'll be seeing 
black and blue.

## POINTER 4694
Don't talk to me 
or I'll crush you.

## POINTER 4695
Don't talk to me 
or I'll bean you to death.

## POINTER 4696
Don't talk to me 
or I'll call up 
a storm.

## POINTER 4697
Don't talk to me 
or your appendix 
will burst.

## POINTER 4698
Don't talk to me 
or I'll tear you up.

## POINTER 4699
Don't talk to me 
or you'll be swimming.
