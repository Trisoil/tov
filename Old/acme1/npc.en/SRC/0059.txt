## POINTER 5900
I'll start again tomorrow. 
I'm not worried about the blastia. <PAGE>My deadline is 
fast approaching.

## POINTER 5901
If we have to choose, let's speak the language of hope.

## POINTER 5902
The people of this city 
are always thinking 
about what work is. <PAGE>It's a good thing.

## POINTER 5903
But there's a part of me somewhere 
that's trying to cry scream, 
"it's all just a big lie!"...

## POINTER 5904
The night is a time for rest...<PAGE>A toast to these brief moments of relaxation!

## POINTER 5905
When night approaches... I wish sometimes 
it could stay dark forever.

## POINTER 5906
There are some things in life 
it's silly to fight against.

## POINTER 5907
We must learn to accept the lot we've been given...

## POINTER 5908
Laziness is what gave 
birth to civilization. <PAGE>People created tools to 
make their work easier.

## POINTER 5909
Our impulse to create and invent comes from 
a desire to make our lives easier, you see...<PAGE>Am I wrong?

## POINTER 5910
Life's events can trip you 
up from time to time.<PAGE>When such things happen, there are those 
who make excuses for their failure, 
and those who simply make do...

## POINTER 5911
Which side do you fall on?

## POINTER 5912
Welcome to Heliord, newest addition to the empire's cities. 
Um...<PAGE>Lots of our citizens 
have gone missing recently.

## POINTER 5913
Fled at night? 
No... 
It has to be some big conspiracy.

## POINTER 5914
Leave town from the other exit. 
Head east and you'll come to Torim Harbor.<PAGE>It might not be 
such a good idea to leave 
town at night.

## POINTER 5915
If you proceed east from the exit 
over there you'll reach Dahngrest.<PAGE>It might not be 
such a good idea to leave 
town at night.

## POINTER 5916
Leave town from the other exit. 
Head east and you'll come to Torim Harbor.<PAGE>If you leave town at night, 
you might discover something new.

## POINTER 5917
If you proceed east from the exit 
over there you'll reach Dahngrest.<PAGE>If you leave town at night, 
you might discover something new.

## POINTER 5918
Leave town from the other exit. 
Head east and you'll come to Torim Harbor.<PAGE>If you leave town at night, 
you'll be sorry.

## POINTER 5919
If you proceed east from the exit 
over there you'll reach Dahngrest.<PAGE>If you leave town at night, 
you'll be sorry.

## POINTER 5920
Leave town from the other exit. 
Head east and you'll come to Torim Harbor.<PAGE>The night is... 
it's so terrible I can speak no more.

## POINTER 5921
If you proceed east from the exit 
over there you'll reach Dahngrest.<PAGE>The night is... 
it's so terrible I can speak no more.

## POINTER 5922
Do not speak.

## POINTER 5923
I've got a weak stomach...

## POINTER 5924
You've gotta let me in there...

## POINTER 5925
My stomach's killing me...<PAGE>Wonder if it was that banana 
I found earlier today.

## POINTER 5926
I'd sell my soul to 
the devil himself...<PAGE>If he agreed to free me 
from this suffering...

## POINTER 5927
Ohhh, the pain...<PAGE>Hey, I'm starting to feel a bit better!

## POINTER 5928
Oh, you were
brought here from upstairs too.<PAGE>At this hour,
all the workers are
at the construction site.

## POINTER 5929
Isn't there anything we can do to 
improve the lives of the needy?<PAGE>I want to do my part to 
help the town, too.

## POINTER 5930
If we assume that fairness has 
a place in this world...<PAGE>Shouldn't we start by making things 
fair between men and women?

## POINTER 5931
Is it right for women to be treated 
unfairly, just because they're women?

## POINTER 5932
Why should anyone care if some women 
are manly, and some men are girly?

## POINTER 5933
In an ideal society, we'd celebrate 
our diversity, instead of worrying about 
how men and women should behave.

## POINTER 5934
Progress happens when we choose the best 
choice out of the many available to us.<PAGE>Clinging stubbornly to only one set of values 
can never be a good thing, in the end.

## POINTER 5935
My life's gonna be a whole 
new set of choices.<PAGE>And just you watch, somebody will choose me!

## POINTER 5936
Mom and Dad have started coming 
home every night, again.

## POINTER 5937
It's almost time for us to eat dinner together.

## POINTER 5938
I remember something my dad said...<PAGE>If all people are not happy, 
then none of us can be happy.

## POINTER 5939
Are you happy?

## POINTER 5940
My parents tell me I have to go 
to bed, but I'm not even tired...

## POINTER 5941
It's no fair! Mom and Dad are still awake.

## POINTER 5942
Hey, what are "little white lies?"

## POINTER 5943
Dad said to stop telling them, but...

## POINTER 5944
After Sir <STR>(FRE)'s arrival, 
shelters were built for 
people who have no homes.<PAGE>Bless him. Bless his heart.

## POINTER 5945
After Sir <STR>(FRE)'s arrival, 
all the villains were 
sent to jail.<PAGE>Bless him. Bless his heart...

## POINTER 5946
I bought blankets for some of the children.<PAGE>No one should have to spend 
the night shivering.

## POINTER 5947
We must make sure the children grow 
up holding onto their dreams.

## POINTER 5948
We grown-ups cannot simply lie to 
them because we are too busy.

## POINTER 5949
What would the world come to if 
children grew up not thinking 
that telling lies is wrong?

## POINTER 5950
Trying to determine the authenticity 
of rumors is an exercise in futility.

## POINTER 5951
We're having such a nice chat here, I'll 
stop putting such a damper on the mood.

## POINTER 5952
At last, my work for the day is done.

## POINTER 5953
I've been wondering, lately.<PAGE>Which would be the easier 
way to die, by over work, 
or starvation...?

## POINTER 5954
There's no equality among people, and no fairness, either.<PAGE>This town's taught me that.

## POINTER 5955
All we can hope to do is 
each worry and toil away 
at our own lots in life.

## POINTER 5956
During the day, these children are little hell-raisers.<PAGE>But at night, their sleeping faces make 
them look just like little angels.

## POINTER 5957
Their peaceful faces ease 
the pain of a day's work.

## POINTER 5958
Just why is it that so many 
of the rules we live by seem 
to contradict each other?

## POINTER 5959
Some of life's rules we 
must obey, though we know 
them to be faulty...<PAGE>Teaching such things to 
children is no easy task.

## POINTER 5960
A small child's words can 
stab you in the heart. <PAGE>Probably because 
adults think it without 
being able to say it.

## POINTER 5961
Perhaps it's that their words are the things 
we think, but would never dare to say.

## POINTER 5962
What sort of ingredients do you like to put in your curry?

## POINTER 5963
I mean, potatoes and carrots are pretty 
much no-brainers to start with.

## POINTER 5964
Too hard, and it gets on your nerves. Too 
soft, and it leaves you wanting more.<PAGE>People are like pasta. Always go for the al dente!

## POINTER 5965
We should live our lives like we cook pasta!

## POINTER 5966
The rainy season makes everything so sticky, I just can't stand it.<PAGE>But we've got to have rain. Otherwise 
the crops wouldn't grow.

## POINTER 5967
People are the same way...<PAGE>We've all had times when the blues just won't 
let up, like during the rainy season.

## POINTER 5968
Leave the protection of the town to the Knights, and 
leave the protection of the home to the wives!<PAGE>It doesn't take a sword to keep the peace 
in a house, just a few killer recipes!

## POINTER 5969
Food can be a poison...
Even a good wife has a
little poison in her.

## POINTER 5970
......<PAGE>I wonder where the nobles' mansions are?

## POINTER 5971
There are plenty of apathetic 
people in this town.<PAGE>I don't think they started 
out that way, though.

## POINTER 5972
I wonder if there's a job they could do that 
would make them feel more worthwhile.

## POINTER 5973
People can't do without happiness!<PAGE>No matter how lethargic a person might be, 
if they can figure out what makes them happy, 
they'll have a reason to keep busy.

## POINTER 5974
What about a cafe where the employees 
are prickly to customers even 
though they like them? <PAGE>What do you think?

## POINTER 5975
I'm so happy the maid 
cafe is doing so well. <PAGE>But I've gotten so wrapped 
up, I've forgotten to get 
a room for the night...

## POINTER 5976
Where is the cafe? <PAGE>It's deep into the city. 
But it's members only! 
You'll never get in!

## POINTER 5977
Are you feeling tired?<PAGE>Why not let me help you relax a bit?

## POINTER 5978
I hope to further develop the culture 
of hospitality in the future.

## POINTER 5979
There's nothin' finer than that first 
drink after a job well done.

## POINTER 5980
You'd better not try and tell me I wasn't workin'!

## POINTER 5981
It's nothin' but a rotten lie that 
drinkin' makes people go bad!

## POINTER 5982
Drinks only let's us see that 
people are bad to begin with.

## POINTER 5983
Drinkin', fightin', and buyin' stuff. A man's world revolves around these things.

## POINTER 5984
How could a fella hope to enjoy life 
without a healthy dose of all three?

## POINTER 5985
You mustn't drink to 
escape from reality.<PAGE>Best to sit the bottle on the shelf if you get to feelin' that way.

## POINTER 5986
No, we drink to sing high 
the praises of life!<PAGE>Three cheers to my life and yours!

## POINTER 5987
It's because of Sir <STR>(FRE) 
that I have a roof over 
my head when I sleep.<PAGE>It makes me so happy.

## POINTER 5988
I used to sleep on a board I put 
down under the eaves of a shop...

## POINTER 5989
Now I get to sleep in 
a toasty warm bed.<PAGE>It's so nice.

## POINTER 5990
I've never had my own big 
fluffy blanket before...

## POINTER 5991
I got to eat an apple-mango 
parfait for desert!<PAGE>It was sooo good.

## POINTER 5992
Maybe I can have a strawberry 
cream-tart next time.

## POINTER 5993
I started thinking that being happy meant 
getting to have whatever you want.

## POINTER 5994
But that's not it at all...<PAGE>It's the moments you're working your 
hardest to get something you want. 
That's where happiness is.

## POINTER 5995
I'm trying to reason out what 
living a good life involves.<PAGE>What do you think?

## POINTER 5996
Living a good life, to me, is an end result.<PAGE>So then, how should we act in 
order to produce this result?

## POINTER 5997
The one who laughs at 1Gald will 
end up crying about 1Gald. <PAGE>A small waste can 
cause big problems.

## POINTER 5998
No matter how little a person may have, 
saving money a bit at a time is crucial.

## POINTER 5999
No matter how much money 
I save, I know it won't help 
against the monsters. <PAGE>Even so, I keep 
on saving.
