## POINTER 2413
My friend moved 
to a town called 
Heliord.<PAGE>It's s'posed to be a new 
town the Empire made.

## POINTER 2414
We were writing letters to each 
other but now they don't come anymore...I 
wonder what's wrong?

## POINTER 2415
I wonder what kind of place the 
new town the Empire made is?

## POINTER 2416
My friend in Heliord finally 
sent me a letter. She says 
it's real bad there.

## POINTER 2417
All the grownups are panicked 
because some guy called the 
Don died. But I'm fine.

## POINTER 2418
You can't live if you spend 
all your time moping around.

## POINTER 2419
All the grownups say something 
happened in Zaphias. But 
I'm not worried about it.

## POINTER 2420
You can't live if you spend 
all your time worrying.

## POINTER 2421
All the grownups are going crazy about 
something that came out of the sea. But 
it doesn't have anything to do with me.

## POINTER 2422
You can't live if you spend 
all your time panicking.

## POINTER 2423
All the grownups are scared 
about that big monster in 
the sky. But I'm not.

## POINTER 2424
Won't someone 
go kill it?

## POINTER 2425
This port is the bridge that connects 
our Guild to the world!<PAGE>We're going to travel across the six 
continents and rule the entire world!

## POINTER 2426
Not that anything special would happen 
if we ruled the world, I guess.

## POINTER 2427
Across the sea in Halure, I heard tell from a 
traveling merchant of a miraculous young lady 
who made flowers grow from a dead tree.<PAGE>This sounds a bit fishy to 
me, but the barrier blastia 
was repaired!

## POINTER 2428
In truth, they probably 
hired a mage who 
fixed it easily.<PAGE>And the simple folk of Halure
just made up this story of
a miraculous young lady.

## POINTER 2429
The the Union collapses, 
Torim might become the 
center of all the Guilds.

## POINTER 2430
With two of the Five Master Guilds out 
of commission, doesn't that make 
Fortune's Market the most influential?

## POINTER 2431
It seems like the world is falling 
to pieces lately...I guess 
this is no time for travel.

## POINTER 2432
I wonder what I'll do now...

## POINTER 2433
I heard that the Knights 
have been in a big hurry 
getting ships together.

## POINTER 2434
You think they're planning on going 
to that structure out on the sea?

## POINTER 2435
I've been all over this world, 
but I've never seen anything 
like that monster.

## POINTER 2436
That thing blows my mind.

## POINTER 2437
The sailors in my day 
had a bit more zest 
to them, y'know?!<PAGE>Young folk nowadays 
are good for nothing!

## POINTER 2438
Looks like I might 
be forced out 
of retirement!

## POINTER 2439
Men are born to 
live! And die! 
On the sea!

## POINTER 2440
The seas are a wonderful 
thing, y'know.

## POINTER 2441
Getting the Don on his first boat 
is my most proud memory...

## POINTER 2442
Rest in peace, 
Don...

## POINTER 2443
Something happened over 
on Ilyccia, eh?

## POINTER 2444
I can't be concerned with what goes 
on beyond the sea. My hands are full 
with what's going on right here!

## POINTER 2445
The Knights came looking 
for experienced 
seamen...but why?

## POINTER 2446
Experienced seamen! Why 
didn't they ask me?

## POINTER 2447
Even a sailor as experienced 
as I can't sail to the sky.

## POINTER 2448
I suppose I'll let the young folk take 
care of the monster in the sky.

## POINTER 2449
Oh ho ho ho! Aren't ships a 
delight? A ship allows one to 
travel so very many places.<PAGE>Thrills! Mystery! Spectacle! 
All mine.

## POINTER 2450
What...? You don't own 
a boat? How dreadful.

## POINTER 2451
Oh ho ho ho! Aren't ships a 
delight? A ship allows one to 
travel so very many places.<PAGE>Miracles! Wonders! 
All mine.

## POINTER 2452
Oh ho ho ho! Aren't ships a 
delight? A ship allows one to 
travel so very many places.<PAGE>Risks! Returns! 
All mine.

## POINTER 2453
Oh ho ho ho! Aren't ships a delight? 
A ship allows one to travel 
so very many places. <PAGE>Bread! Cake! 
All mine.

## POINTER 2454
Oh ho ho ho! Aren't ships a delight? 
A ship allows one to travel 
so very many places. <PAGE>You! Me! 
All mine.

## POINTER 2455
Oh ho ho ho! Aren't ships a delight? 
A ship allows one to travel 
so very many places. <PAGE>Vous! Moi! 
All mine.

## POINTER 2456
Oh ho ho ho! Aren't ships a delight? 
A ship allows one to travel 
so very many places. <PAGE>Giant monsters! Giant 
structures! All mine.

## POINTER 2457
The Empire's warships 
are wonderful! The design, color, 
and cool knights! I'm in love!

## POINTER 2458
Huh? You need something? 
Quit looking at me like 
that, you pervert!

## POINTER 2459
Ahh! Doesn't the sea breeze 
feel wonderful on your skin?<PAGE>And the sun is shining so bright...ooh, 
the sea is the best!

## POINTER 2460
Now, everyone can sleep in peace 
because the Gattuso who haunted Halure 
and Capua Nor has been destroyed!∀<PAGE>I hope someone will destroy those 
mermen that rose up from the sea!

## POINTER 2461
I can't take it! The sound of 
those mermen makes me so anxious! 
Won't someone destroy them!<PAGE>...Huh? You need something? 
Quit looking at me like 
that, you pervert!

## POINTER 2462
Cast your troubles in the sea, 
and they'll be washed away. You'll 
feel better in an instant!

## POINTER 2463
*Sigh*...look at me, all sticky from the 
sea breeze. Not that getting a little sticky 
makes the sea any less wonderful!

## POINTER 2464
What's this? Some weird structure 
showed up in MY sea?<PAGE>Wonderful! It's a mystery 
of the sea! ∀

## POINTER 2465
Give me back my beautiful blue skies! 
Give me back my blazing sun! And while 
you're at it, give me back my youth!

## POINTER 2466
The slow gathering of dusk!
Relaxing and peaceful sky!
My pillar of strength!<PAGE>It's got me
feeling so excited!

## POINTER 2467
There was 
something exploding 
on the sea!<PAGE>What could it be?

## POINTER 2468
Hey, you arrived 
by ship right?<PAGE>Do you know anything about 
those explosions on the sea?

## POINTER 2469
If you travel south by ship from 
this port, you'll be able to see 
the continent of Desier on your 
right, and Hypionia on your left.<PAGE>There's a coliseum city in 
Desier, you know. I'd like 
to go there some day...

## POINTER 2470
The coliseum...blood spewing, 
meat flying...just once, I'd like 
to see it with my own eyes.

## POINTER 2471
The coliseum in Nordopolica 
is administrated by a Guild 
called Palestralle.

## POINTER 2472
Don't you think a Guild 
administrating a coliseum 
is sort of incredible?

## POINTER 2473
The Don is dead...
He was a fearless 
and great old man.<PAGE>If he ever fought in 
the coliseum, he would 
defeat them all!

## POINTER 2474
Ahh, how I'd love to 
go see the coliseum, to 
rip up and throw...

## POINTER 2475
It would be my bet receipts 
I'd be ripping up, of course.

## POINTER 2476
Please, I beg of you. 
Take me to the coliseum 
before I die!

## POINTER 2477
If only I could go to 
the coliseum...I could 
die with no regrets!

## POINTER 2478
You came on an Empire 
warship?! Are you some kind 
of imperial bigshot?<PAGE>...You don't really look it......

## POINTER 2479
I feel a bit bad because the 
Empire's warship has turned up.

## POINTER 2480
You see that barrier blastia? 
It's the twin of the 
one in Capua Nor.<PAGE>A long time ago, there was a third 
for Capua Duo out on the ocean, 
and they were all one.

## POINTER 2481
It's really all because of that 
barrier blastia we can live 
in such comfort, isn't it?

## POINTER 2482
The atmosphere in Capua Nor has 
improved immensely because Magistrate 
Ragou has been expelled.<PAGE>Now I can visit my 
uncle who lives 
across the sea.

## POINTER 2483
Didn't I hear about an active 
Knight in Capua Nor
known as <STR>(FRE)?<PAGE>Those Knights are more than all right. 
We should be grateful to them.

## POINTER 2484
The barrier will protect us 
no matter what happens.

## POINTER 2485
The barrier will protect 
us no matter what happens. 
Probably...

## POINTER 2486
Welcome. You may rest 
here for 300 Gald. 
Will you be staying?

## POINTER 2487
Thank you very much. Please 
stay with us again.

## POINTER 2488
The continent of Tolbyccia 
has Capua Nor and 
Dahngrest on it.<PAGE>And in Dahngrest, there's 
the Union that brings 
the guilds together.

## POINTER 2489
The head of the Union's 
called the Don, and everyone's 
a-scared of him.

## POINTER 2490
You ever met the Don? He's one 
seriously tough customer.

## POINTER 2491
Thanks to the Don in Dahngrest, 
all the scattered Guilds 
are brought together.

## POINTER 2492
I can't believe the Don's dead. He 
wasn't the kind of guy that would 
die just because you killed him.

## POINTER 2493
*Sigh*...

## POINTER 2494
After the Don died,
I was too scared
to go back...<PAGE>I can't imagine the 
chaos in Dahngrest...

## POINTER 2495
I'm worried about Dahgnrest...maybe 
I should go back.

## POINTER 2496
Now I hear the 
Empire's a 
mess, too.

## POINTER 2497
Maybe the Empire 
will fall just like 
the Union, eh?

## POINTER 2498
This ain't no time to be fussing 
over who's a Guildsman and 
who's from the Empire.

## POINTER 2499
When the day comes that monstrous 
hand comes down, we'll 
all be flattened.
