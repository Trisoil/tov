## POINTER 100
You were in the castle, right? 
Did you see <STR>(FRE)?<PAGE>Tell <STR>(FRE) the 
lower quarter's 
in trouble!

## POINTER 101
Hey, you're back already? 
You don't have to run 
away any more? <PAGE>What? You're leaving again? 
Make up your mind...

## POINTER 102
It's kind of 
lonely without 
you around, <STR>(YUR)...<PAGE>Uhh... Nevermind...

## POINTER 103
<STR>(YUR)! I saw 
your wanted poster.<PAGE>I can't believe there's 
a bounty on you! You're 
famous in the Empire!

## POINTER 104
But, it's <STR>(FRE)'s job to 
hunt down people with 
bounties on their heads, right? <PAGE>I sure don't want 
you two to fight...

## POINTER 105
<STR>(FRE)'s a captain now! He got 
the core back for the lower quarter
and everything! He's amazing!<PAGE>And I know <STR>(FRE) will keep 
working for the lower quarter, 
even as a captain.

## POINTER 106
Did you hear about the 
<STR>(FRE) Defense Force? <PAGE>They made me tell 
them everything I know 
about <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 107
Ugh... 
I feel awful...

## POINTER 108
Ever since the sky went all 
funny, something's just...not 
right. This is horrible...

## POINTER 109
It was terrible when I got 
back to the lower quarter!<PAGE>Grass like tree trunks covered 
the entire lower quarter... 
I couldn't believe it.

## POINTER 110
I wonder if <STR>(FRE) will rebuild 
things if we ask. I mean, 
<STR>(FRE)'s really important now!<PAGE><STR>(YUR), go and ask 
<STR>(FRE) for us!

## POINTER 111
<STR>(YUR), you're safe!<PAGE>Your friend said things were 
bad, so I was really worried.

## POINTER 112
No way you'd go down 
that easy, right, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 113
<STR>(FRE) built a new 
town in Hypionia! 
Isn't that amazing?!<PAGE><STR>(FRE)... He's on 
another level, seriously.

## POINTER 114
All the members of the 
<STR>(FRE) Defense Force followed 
<STR>(FRE) to his new town.<PAGE>They just don't get it! 
<STR>(FRE) would really remain 
here in the lower quarter.

## POINTER 115
The aque blastia broke, huh?<PAGE>No surprise there. They only 
let us have old beat-up blastia 
here in the lower quarter.

## POINTER 116
If you've got a problem 
with it, go tell the imperial 
family or the Council. <PAGE>They're the ones who 
decide what we get.

## POINTER 117
You see that, beyond those buildings? 
That's our barrier blastia, the Sword Stair. 
It protects Zaphias from monsters.<PAGE>The barrier is incredibly important... 
Our lives and livelihood depend on it.

## POINTER 118
Almost all the towns in the 
Empire have a barrier blastia, 
not just here in Zaphias.<PAGE>Places without them have 
to fortify and arm themselves 
to keep the monsters out.

## POINTER 119
The knights will find a reason to 
arrest anyone they don't like, 
even if you haven't done anything.<PAGE>It's not a good time to 
come back here, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 120
I don't even 
trust <STR>(FRE).<PAGE>They keep an eye on the 
lower quarter too. You 
shouldn't stick around.

## POINTER 121
The Empire has a monopoly on 
the various blastia in Zaphias, 
including the barrier blastia.

## POINTER 122
Historically speaking, the 
emperors never had the authority 
to control access to blastia.<PAGE>The imperial family 
doesn't know their place. 
Fools, all of them.

## POINTER 123
After the to-do with Magistrate 
Ragou, the Council's reputation 
has taken a huge hit.<PAGE>Now the balance between the Council 
and the Imperial Knights is wavering... 
What will become of our Empire?

## POINTER 124
There's no question the Empire
is in a state of disarray. <PAGE>The imperial family 
no longer has the 
power to quell this chaos.

## POINTER 125
Hey, <STR>(YUR). 
You come looking 
for something? <PAGE>Anything you need for work should 
be lying around here somewhere. 
Take whatever you need.

## POINTER 126
Onions, carrots, and...
Is this crate booze bottles? <PAGE>Lucky I noticed, I was just about 
to kick this thing away and 
shatter them all. That was close!

## POINTER 127
So you're back, <STR>(YUR)? 
Up to your old tricks, I hear.

## POINTER 128
So who's the 
young lady? <PAGE>The poor thing. 
This nasty place is 
nowhere to bring a girl.

## POINTER 129
Hey, welcome back! 
Nice to see you're 
still alive.

## POINTER 130
You should visit 
your old room 
once in a while, <STR>(YUR). <PAGE>If you don't take care 
of it, the dust in there 
will start forming strata!

## POINTER 131
The Schwann Brigade, 
the Cumore Brigade...
And now the <STR>(FRE) Brigade?<PAGE>Impressive, that boy.

## POINTER 132
I hope the Imperial Knights 
improve, even a little.

## POINTER 133
Halt! 
If you go any further, 
you'll leave the city.<PAGE>The world outside Zaphias' barrier 
is swarming with monsters. It's too 
dangerous for you equipped like that.

## POINTER 134
You cannot be allowed 
to leave the city with such 
light equipment. <PAGE>Come back with the 
proper armaments.

## POINTER 135
An emergency order 
has been issued 
to seal off the capital. <PAGE>None may pass.

## POINTER 136
The gate is sealed. 
No one may pass until 
the order is lifted.

## POINTER 137
They ordered 
this gate closed...
Hey, you're... <PAGE>I'm going to go take a 
look at the wanted poster. 
You wait right here...

## POINTER 138
Hmmm... I can't tell 
if you look like the 
wanted poster or not...

## POINTER 139
Welcome to the Imperial 
Capital of Zaphias.

## POINTER 140
Welcome to the Imperial 
Capital of Zaph... Huh? 
You're...not a traveler...<PAGE>Well, you look 
like one...

## POINTER 141
There are monsters just 
outside the barrier! 
It's far safer inside the capital!<PAGE>Citizens, stay calm. The 
Knights are protecting Zaphias. 
There is no reason to evacuate!

## POINTER 142
Damn it all... 
What in the world 
is going on?

## POINTER 143
Commandant Alexei
rode off on a 
monster somewhere. <PAGE>Maybe I should 
follow him...

## POINTER 144
With the barrier gone, 
the Knights are the last line 
of defense for the capital.

## POINTER 145
If Commandant Alexei brought this 
disaster, then it is our duty to 
protect the capital with our lives.

## POINTER 146
The monsters that invaded the 
capital and caused all the uproar 
have been taken care of. <PAGE>People can finally live in 
the capital again safely again.

## POINTER 147
Zaphias is safe. 
There is no need to evacuate.

## POINTER 148
Welcome! 
Welcome to my 
magnificent atelier! <PAGE>Can you tell that I crackle 
with ferocious creative power, 
this very instant?

## POINTER 149
As you can see, I am an artist. 
I paint portraits, and now I find a 
spectacular subject before me! <PAGE>Will you allow me to paint your 
likeness? It would surely flex 
my dazzling creative muscles!

## POINTER 150
Wait, wait a moment! Has the good 
sir seen my work yet? It burns 
with a palpable passion!

## POINTER 151
Your wanted poster. Your wanted 
poster, good sir! It was none 
other than I who painted it! <PAGE>You're a very distinctive young 
man, so I remembered it well. 
It is a masterwork, is it not?

## POINTER 152
Ahh, the hero returns! Wait, 
your bounty has been cleared? <PAGE>Oh dear oh dear. 
Now my art will no longer be 
displayed throughout the city.

## POINTER 153
I've got it! I'll put it up right here! 
Ahh, your wanted poster! 
...What, no good?

## POINTER 154
The sky is the color 
of the water after 
I wash my brushes . <PAGE>Landscapes aren't my specialty, 
but ohhh, this color...

## POINTER 155
The other day a dragon flew over 
the capital! Oh! Such a proud 
mark of winged valor! <PAGE>If you ever see one, do come 
tell me. I must burn that heroic 
silhouette onto canvas forever!

## POINTER 156
The other day at the refugee camp, 
I saw a dragon flying toward Zaphias.<PAGE>But it was struck down by 
that uncanny aurora 
in the sky!

## POINTER 157
Might I have been dreaming...? 
I must admit I was up the 
whole night painting...<PAGE>No matter! Dream or illusion, 
I will paint that dragon! That is 
the artiste's raison d'etre!

## POINTER 158
Commandant Alexei started 
some sort of rebellion...? <PAGE>Hmm. I only ever heard 
good things about him. 
Maybe he was blinded by greed.

## POINTER 159
Ah! The heavens have just sent 
me a brilliant idea! Portraits 
of Alexei! Oh, I'll be rich!

## POINTER 160
Good sir! They say you were 
childhood friends with the popular 
young knight captain? <PAGE>Would deign to let me paint your 
double portrait? Two heroes 
destined to live on in history!

## POINTER 161
Two youths--childhood friends--now 
find themselves hunter and hunted! 
Ah, cruel fate!... <PAGE>That is how I see the piece. 
Do come back with 
the young captain.

## POINTER 162
Welcome! 
If it isn't <STR>(YUR). <PAGE>We've got some good 
stuff on sale today!

## POINTER 163
Fortune's Market, where we pride 
ourselves on providing sales with 
a smile! Come back any time!

## POINTER 164
Well, if it isn't Zaphias' very own idol! 
Maybe I should put a sign 
up saying "Celebrities Shop Here".

## POINTER 165
Fortune's Market, 
where the celebrities shop! 
Thanks for visiting!

## POINTER 166
I don't think it's a 
good idea for you to be 
hanging around here. <PAGE>Hurry up before 
you get caught.

## POINTER 167
Taxes went up again. Sooner 
or later it's going to affect prices...

## POINTER 168
Fortune's Market, where we're 
prepared to hemorrhage profits to get 
your business! Thanks for visiting!

## POINTER 169
The town's sealed off now, right? 
Having so few people around 
isn't very good for sales.

## POINTER 170
Fortune's Market, where we 
do business as long as we 
still breathe! Come again!

## POINTER 171
Zaphias may be in a sorry 
state of affairs, but we're not 
leaving yet. Take your time!

## POINTER 172
Fortune's Market, where the 
smiles cost zero Gald! Come on 
back whenever you need a smile.

## POINTER 173
Thanks to that weird monster, 
supplies are selling like crazy. 
I don't know if I should be happy...

## POINTER 174
Fortune's Market, where...uhh...I 
can't think of anything. These lines 
are a guild member's duty, too...

## POINTER 175
As long as we have the Knights 
to protect us, Zaphias is safe. 
Shop in peace.

## POINTER 176
Fortune's Market, 
where quality comes first! 
Thanks for coming!

## POINTER 177
Relaxing in a beautiful town 
without a care in the world, 
my sweetheart by my side... <PAGE>Is it all right to 
be so happy?

## POINTER 178
A life of peace is the 
greatest happiness there is. <PAGE>I'm so glad 
I live here.

## POINTER 179
What's the town 
so restless about?<PAGE>It seems like the Knights 
are searching for someone.

## POINTER 180
There was such a commotion in 
the lower quarter earlier about 
their fountain stopping.<PAGE>They could stand to be a little 
more quiet. I'm trying to spend 
some time with my sweetheart.

## POINTER 181
You're the scoundrel 
the Knights are searching 
for, aren't you? <PAGE>You certainly look 
like a scoundrel.

## POINTER 182
Hey! I thought the Knights 
captured you? 
So did they or didn't they?!

## POINTER 183
You're the one the Knights 
were looking for earlier, right?<PAGE>What did you do? 
And how on earth could 
you be innocent?

## POINTER 184
Whatever, just don't bother me. 
I'm spending time with my sweetheart.<PAGE>Don't you go 
stealing my heart. ∀

## POINTER 185
Do you know about Captain <STR>(FRE)? 
He made captain even though 
he's from the lower quarter.<PAGE>He's kind to us citizens, 
unlike the other knights.

## POINTER 186
Not only is Captain <STR>(FRE) kind, 
he's so good-looking!∀<PAGE>All the girls of Zaphias
have had their eyes 
on him for a while.

## POINTER 187
With our barrier and thick 
ramparts, Zaphias is the 
safest place in the world...<PAGE>It's where the emperor lives, 
so the Imperial Knights 
keep a very close watch.

## POINTER 188
I'm proud to 
be from Zaphias. <PAGE>This is a wonderful place to 
live, and more importantly, 
it's where I met my girl.

## POINTER 189
The capital has been sealed because 
some thief the Knights caught 
in the royal quarter escaped.<PAGE>They aren't letting anyone 
cross through the barrier.

## POINTER 190
Isn't closing off the entire 
city a little excessive? 
It's such a bother for us citizens.

## POINTER 191
They still haven't caught the thief. 
They put up pictures of the guy, 
but they're terrible.<PAGE>Hey...
You kinda look like him...

## POINTER 192
Even a picture as bad as 
that can capture a person's 
special features.

## POINTER 193
The pictures of the thief 
from the royal quarter
were finally taken down. <PAGE>I guess they finally caught him.

## POINTER 194
That's the Knights for you. 
Always protecting the 
peace of the capital.

## POINTER 195
I heard the Knights uncovered 
treachery by a magistrate and 
saved the people of some town.<PAGE>You can always count 
on the Knights!

## POINTER 196
It's all thanks to the Knights 
protecting the capital that we can spend 
our days in such peace and quiet.

## POINTER 197
It's been a while now since my 
hometown was destroyed and 
I came to live in the capital. <PAGE>It's so quiet. It's really 
a great place to live.

## POINTER 198
Living comfortably 
helps enrich your
heart, too. <PAGE>If you've got a stable 
livelihood, doesn't that 
put your mind at ease?

## POINTER 199
Everyone in the city is so kind.<PAGE>I visit the lower quarter sometimes, 
too. It's so lively, and the 
people are so nice. It's great!
