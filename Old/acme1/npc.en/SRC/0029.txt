## POINTER 2900
I hear the Knights have lost their 
captains, and the influence they wield 
is splitting up here and there.<PAGE>It might not be long before 
Nordopolica is in the hands 
of Palestralle again.

## POINTER 2901
I just wish they would 
do something about that 
monster in the sky.

## POINTER 2902
You see that headless statue? That's 
the warriors' protector-goddess, 
the "Virgin of Benevolence".<PAGE>It's supposed to be almost eight 
hundred years old, the head 
washed away by a huge wave.

## POINTER 2903
Maybe it's time for us to pray 
to her, too. For our own safety, 
and for peace in the world...

## POINTER 2904
Hey, mister. Why 
doesn't that statue 
have a head?<PAGE>Did someone play a 
prank and steal it?

## POINTER 2905
Is it supposed to be a lady? She must 
have been really pretty, if people 
wanted to make a statue out of her.<PAGE>How nice...I hope they 
make a statue of 
me some day, too.

## POINTER 2906
There's a cave called Cados to 
the west of town, you know.<PAGE>I've been told I mustn't 
go near it because 
it's so dangerous.

## POINTER 2907
They say it makes a squeaking 
noise like a flute or something 
when the wind blows.<PAGE>That's why it has another name, 
you know: "The Weasand of Cados".

## POINTER 2908
Some monsters got out of the coliseum. The 
reverse barrier must not be very strong!<PAGE>I wonder if they'll come 
and eat me when I'm 
sleeping at night...?

## POINTER 2909
By the way, it's called a reverse barrier because 
it's supposed to keep monsters in...the opposite 
of the barriers that keep monsters out.

## POINTER 2910
Are the Imperial Knights 
our enemies? Or are 
they our friends?<PAGE>They killed the monsters for 
us, but the grownups don't seem 
to like them very much.

## POINTER 2911
I hope they're 
our friends.<PAGE>It would be awful 
having so many 
enemies around!

## POINTER 2912
The grownups say Belius died, 
but I don't really understand. 
I never even saw her.<PAGE>Now the Knights are here, 
and it's peaceful...right?

## POINTER 2913
That reminds me, someone 
called Don died, too.<PAGE>I've never seen 
him either. Where 
was he from?

## POINTER 2914
What's that thing in the 
sky? It's moving, isn't 
it? Is it alive?<PAGE>Is that our...enemy?

## POINTER 2915
At least we have 
the Knights here.<PAGE>They'll protect 
us, right?

## POINTER 2916
The grownups say the whole 
world's in chaos.<PAGE>But I'm not scared! We're 
all going to protect 
this town together.

## POINTER 2917
The sky is so high up...that thing 
doesn't even seem very scary.<PAGE>Is it really even 
dangerous?

## POINTER 2918
An accident has occurred within the 
coliseum, and we have been dispatched 
to deal with the situation.<PAGE>Our duty as Imperial Knights is to 
protect each and every settlement 
within the Empire's territory.

## POINTER 2919
We will ensure this 
city's safety.

## POINTER 2920
Welcome to Nordopolica's 
lodging facilities. <PAGE>It's 500 Gald per night... 
Will that be all right?

## POINTER 2921
Thank you.
Hope to see you again.

## POINTER 2922
Some suspicious characters stayed
at the inn a few days ago.<PAGE>We later found out they were 
Imperial Knights. They came 
around in armor just now.

## POINTER 2923
Why have they come 
to this town?<PAGE>They were standing around town 
wearing normal clothing. 
They tricked us, the swine!

## POINTER 2924
If we knew there were knights
staying at the inn, we would have
showed them their welcome.

## POINTER 2925
Welcome to Fortune's Market's 
outlet store!<PAGE>Going traveling? Jumping into 
the coliseum? Get everything 
you need right here!

## POINTER 2926
Thank you very much.

## POINTER 2927
Welcome, welcome. 
This is the Coliseum Informer.<PAGE>I can tell you 
the hottest topics 
in town, for free!

## POINTER 2928
Of course right now, 
the hottest topic is the coliseum!<PAGE>Those clashing swords 
really get the spectator’s 
hearts pounding!

## POINTER 2929
I'm an informer with all the 
latest information! The 
Sands of Kogorh you say?<PAGE>Well, normally there is a regular 
service, but right now it's blocked 
up and the road is closed.

## POINTER 2930
They say it’ll take 
about a fortnight to 
restart regular service.<PAGE>Perhaps around the time 
of the next new moon...

## POINTER 2931
I'm an informer who can always deliver 
the latest information! Right now the hottest 
topic is the undefeated champion!<PAGE>Clad in some real high-class armor, 
and with awesome swordsmanship!

## POINTER 2932
I can't see this champion 
being knocked off 
his pedestal!<PAGE>And I tell you what, this is 
gonna put the tipster out 
of business for a while too!

## POINTER 2933
Always the latest information! 
The coliseum is always hot, but you 
should steer clear for the time being.<PAGE>...Unless of course you 
want to be eaten 
by a monster!

## POINTER 2934
I can’t rely on help from the Imperial Knights, 
but if we have Palestralle's support, 
we could easily take out the monster!

## POINTER 2935
Always the latest information! 
Today I’ll tell you about 
Belius’s private face! <PAGE>Duce Belius's beauty is peerless, no 
one in the world comes even close...
But her age is forever a secret...

## POINTER 2936
You want to know 
Belius’s age?<PAGE>Didn't your mother 
teach you it's' rude to ask 
a lady her age?

## POINTER 2937
I'm an informer who delivers the town's 
latest information! Every month, something 
happens on the new moon!<PAGE>No one knows what's 
going to happen 
until it happens!

## POINTER 2938
There could be a storm coming, 
or it might be a rainbow...<PAGE>Good or bad does it all 
depend on how we behave!?

## POINTER 2939
The latest information 
from Nordopolica... 
Belius is dead...<PAGE>This is the end, 
for this job...
for Palestralle...

## POINTER 2940
This informer is under direct 
control from Palestralle.<PAGE>If there’s no Belius, then doing this 
has neither meaning 
nor worth.

## POINTER 2941
Belius is dead, 
but at least we have a brand new, 
revamped tournament!<PAGE>Belius wouldn’t 
want us moping 
around forever!

## POINTER 2942
They are currently 
accepting entries.<PAGE>For now, I would recommend entering 
a guy who can take out at 
least thirty people.

## POINTER 2943
Outside there is panic because of the monster
in the sky. What better way to increase your skills
to defeat the monster than in the tournament?<PAGE>Taking on the best warriors in 
the world will be pretty 
good training for you!

## POINTER 2944
The content of the tournament 
has been reviewed, and the number 
of new entries increased.<PAGE>You should try it out!

## POINTER 2945
Always with the town’s latest information! 
Today, allow me to introduce interim Duce
Lord Natz who dispatched the monster!<PAGE>He is 43 years old, divorced once,
no children. With bulging biceps!
He’s on the look out for a girlfriend now!

## POINTER 2946
I have just heard that Lord 
Natz has been promoted 
from interim to full Duce!<PAGE>Wonderful news!

## POINTER 2947
At last, I have 
a shop here also!<PAGE>My second shop in Nordopolica, 
opening next month!

## POINTER 2948
Everybody says changing shops in 
this town can be pretty intense!<PAGE>So, I’d better 
get charged up!

## POINTER 2949
I went over the 
Cados mountain range on 
foot when I was peddler...<PAGE>But it’s really steep, 
seriously, it’s no laughing 
matter I can tell you.

## POINTER 2950
It’s hard to go over the Cados mountains, 
but it’s just as hard going through 
the caves on the mountain's face...<PAGE>There’s nothing even there, so 
why even bother... It's nuts!

## POINTER 2951
Finally, I have the full 
set of tools available.<PAGE>Next thing’s to open my shop early 
if the goods have arrived...

## POINTER 2952
Don’t rush! Don’t rush! 
Take a break 
until opening time...

## POINTER 2953
Hmmm...
What could that be...
...uproar in the coliseum...<PAGE>Has the champion won? 
Has the challenger won? 
I knew I should have gone...

## POINTER 2954
I can’t get into the 
coliseum because they 
say it’s sold out!<PAGE>If only I’d decided 
earlier I could 
have got in...

## POINTER 2955
Just two more weeks 
until my shop opens...<PAGE>Ah...I’m nervous 
already...

## POINTER 2956
...Whoops!... I still haven't 
chosen a name for the shop... 
What's a good name...?

## POINTER 2957
I heard the Duce's dead. I wonder 
if things are gonna be alright?<PAGE>The guilds and the Knights are like 
oil and water, if they come there’s 
bound to be more trouble.

## POINTER 2958
If the Knights and the guilds start 
trouble, and if someone dies near 
my shop, what am I gonna do?!

## POINTER 2959
I’m opening soon 
so I’m really 
busy right now.<PAGE>I’ll take a wee break for now...

## POINTER 2960
The ship still hasn’t 
arrived with my stock...<PAGE>Kaufman...
What are you doing...

## POINTER 2961
Immediate Help Wanted! 
How does that sound? 
250 Gald an hour.<PAGE>Instant pay rise 
for hard workers!

## POINTER 2962
Help us to 
double our sales!<PAGE>Looking for a cool guy 
and a cute young girl!

## POINTER 2963
Even if the world is in confusion, 
I have no intention of postponing the 
grand opening of my shop!<PAGE>You can’t trust a 
businessman who is too 
quick to change his plans!

## POINTER 2964
The range of goods is perfect! 
Please come again the next 
time you’re planning a trip!

## POINTER 2965
This town is a treasure trove of 
information. We have its long and 
storied history to thank for that.<PAGE>The more I study, the more 
the machinations of this 
world grow clear to me.

## POINTER 2966
The Empire's history goes back roughly
eight hundred years. This city is even older...
some twelve hundred years old, in fact.<PAGE>It begins at a time when this was just 
a primitive stone dueling ground.

## POINTER 2967
About twenty or thirty kilometers 
west is a tall mountain range 
called the Mother Cados mountains. <PAGE>It's quite a meaningful name, 
but it's only used by 
folks in this town.

## POINTER 2968
Over the Mother Cados mountains lie 
the Sands of Kogorh. But getting 
over those mountains isn't easy!

## POINTER 2969
This city is a treasure chest full of knowledge, 
as befitting a place of such history.<PAGE>The more I learn about this city's history, the more 
I feel I understand how the world really works.

## POINTER 2970
The Empire's history goes back some eight 
hundred years. This city is even older...some 
twelve hundred years old, in fact.<PAGE>It begins at a time when this was just 
a primitive stone duelling grounds.

## POINTER 2971
It seems the Knights went 
deep inside the coliseum...<PAGE>Something terrible 
must be happening.

## POINTER 2972
This city is truly fascinating...as much for its 
historical value as it is for being the gathering 
place of so many rough-and-tumble types.<PAGE>It seems like such a dichotomy, but 
the two unite here in Nordopolica.

## POINTER 2973
Duce Belius? I haven't yet had the 
honor of meeting her, but it seems as 
if she has some interest in Kritya.<PAGE>I don't know 
why, however.

## POINTER 2974
This descendant of an ancient 
clan, the woman who governs 
a city of such contrasts...<PAGE>Yes, the woman called 
Belius interests 
me greatly.

## POINTER 2975
It's a good thing there 
are Knights here to protect 
the city's security.<PAGE>One does have to wonder what the 
warships are for, however.

## POINTER 2976
One small misstep, and 
those warships could destroy 
this entire town.<PAGE>What a terrible blow to 
history the loss of this 
ripe old city would be.

## POINTER 2977
Duce Belius has passed away...I must 
offer my heartfelt condolences.<PAGE>Death means a great loss, but 
at the same time a rite of passage 
for those who still live.

## POINTER 2978
One cannot feign ignorance and 
pretend to be dispassionate on the 
occasion of someone's death.<PAGE>This city will surely be 
facing a time of trial.

## POINTER 2979
The tale of the legendary disaster 
is written of in this city's 
vast library as well.<PAGE>I never imagined 
it would be so 
repugnant...

## POINTER 2980
Should that disaster truly try 
to attack the city, the barrier 
will be meaningless.<PAGE>Is this how humanity 
will end...?

## POINTER 2981
I'm feverishly researching 
how we might stand a chance 
of fighting the disaster.<PAGE>But I have yet to come to 
an acceptable conclusion...what 
should I do...?

## POINTER 2982
If there is no answer to be found 
in the records of the past, we must 
seek out the future on our own.<PAGE>In a situation like this, the intuition 
of the living is more valuable 
than any ancient record.

## POINTER 2983
I came here to visit my friend, 
after he moved into the 
residential district.<PAGE>But they won't let 
me inside...

## POINTER 2984
After coming all this way I was 
dead set on seeing the 
tournament, but it's sold out...<PAGE>Sheesh, way to kick a guy when he's 
down. What the heck am I gonna do if 
my luck gets any worse than this?

## POINTER 2985
A flying monster that can speak? 
No...No, I don’t know.<PAGE>You’re looking for 
something pretty weird!

## POINTER 2986
First of all, 
a talking monster? 
That’s unbelievably scary!<PAGE>I’m scared enough if 
they don’t speak!

## POINTER 2987
I came here to visit 
my friend, after he moved 
into the residential district.<PAGE>But they won't 
let me inside...

## POINTER 2988
Is it always 
so noisy here?<PAGE>I was sleeping at 
the inn, but I was 
woken by the noise.

## POINTER 2989
Has something happened? 
Or is it always 
like this here?

## POINTER 2990
I thought I'd finally be able to see my friend 
who moved into the residential district, 
but they only let residents inside.<PAGE>Am I really going to have to stay 
at the inn again today...?

## POINTER 2991
I'm not a rich man. I'm not 
even sure how I'm going to 
pay for the trip back home.

## POINTER 2992
The Knights are surprisingly cheap. All I 
did was ask them to lend me a little money, 
but they aren't giving me a single Gald.<PAGE>Aren't the Knights supposed 
to help good, decent 
citizens in need?

## POINTER 2993
Surely it wouldn't 
hurt to lend me enough 
to buy supper...

## POINTER 2994
Hey, those warships are going back 
to Zaphias eventually, right?<PAGE>Where's the harm 
in letting me catch 
a ride onboard?

## POINTER 2995
The Knights are surprisingly 
cheap...actually, perhaps 
it isn't so surprising.

## POINTER 2996
Belius died here, and the 
Don died in Dahngrest.<PAGE>Who's next, 
the captain 
in Zaphias?

## POINTER 2997
But...if all three of them died, 
there'd be nobody left to pull 
the world back together.<PAGE>What a crisis we'd 
have then...

## POINTER 2998
That monster in the sky, 
it's over Ilyccia?<PAGE>Ohh, thank the heavens. I'm so glad I came 
here. I'm so happy I didn't go back home!

## POINTER 2999
But it's not like I can stay here 
forever...even my friend's been 
cold to me lately...*sigh*...
