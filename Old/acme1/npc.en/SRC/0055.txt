## POINTER 5500
Perhaps I'll have a chance to make it 
all back somewhere down the road...

## POINTER 5501
This tipster here, name of Itoken, 
once gave me a tip on a bet 
that paid off 100,000 to one.<PAGE>I went ahead and made the bet even though 
I thought it was a scam. Imagine my 
surprise when that thing paid off.

## POINTER 5502
When I won big like that, I had more Gald 
than I knew what to do with, and it 
felt like I was on top of the world.<PAGE>But ever since then, neither Itoken 
or I have been able to win a thing... 
And now I'm up to my ears in debt.

## POINTER 5503
This man's got a pretty sly tongue. Even if 
you lose, he ends up making you feel you did 
the right thing, that it's not your fault.<PAGE>I'm a pretty special piece of 
work myself for getting sucked 
in time after time, though.

## POINTER 5504
This noble woman here is really 
layin' down the big bucks. Maybe 
I should take a chance myself.<PAGE>Just think how great it'd be if 
I could pay off all that debt.

## POINTER 5505
He just predicted a bet that 
paid 500,000 to one...<PAGE>Damn, I'm a fool! Of course 
this is the one and only time 
I don't put money down.

## POINTER 5506
That noble woman's bet 
just paid off...<PAGE>Maybe she'd spare a few Gald 
for a poor old man...

## POINTER 5507
This guy's advice still 
isn't paying off...<PAGE>To think I'm still puttin' down bets just because 
I hit that one jackpot way back when.

## POINTER 5508
Just what am I thinkin' 
placin' bets according 
to this guy's advice?

## POINTER 5509
This fool noble woman's gone 
and put her entire fortune 
on one of Itoken's tips.<PAGE>Not that anybody in as much debt as I 
am is really in any position to talk...

## POINTER 5510
I know I shouldn't be doin' this 
sort of thing, what with Belius' 
death and all, but...<PAGE>I can't seem to make myself 
quit. I'm in a real pickle.

## POINTER 5511
There, ya see? Missed again... This tipster's 
nothin' but a lump of bad luck.<PAGE>Still, my luck's gotta turn sometime, right? I swear, 
I envy anyone too stupid to do what I'm doing.

## POINTER 5512
When I stop and think about it, this crook 
of a tipster's not losin' out at all.<PAGE>His predictions might be off, but 
he's still takin' our money.

## POINTER 5513
I'm at the end of life's road anyway. If I can 
strike it rich just once more, I'll have a nice 
souvenir to take with me to the next world.<PAGE>But it'll never pay off. 
This darned tipster knows 
just what I'm thinkin'.

## POINTER 5514
The time of reckoning's at hand. If it's 
all goin' up in flames anyway, why 
should I be afraid to go bankrupt?

## POINTER 5515
*Sigh* The world can 
go ahead and end 
for all I care...<PAGE>Then at least I wouldn't have to worry 
about my predictions coming true or not...

## POINTER 5516
The more I think about it, 
the more bummed out I seem to become. 
But I guess there's a sort of cold comfort in that...

## POINTER 5517
This is my first time visiting the 
coliseum. I think the excitement 
of it all overwhelmed me a bit...<PAGE>The night breeze from the ocean feels 
marvelous. It calmed me right down.∀

## POINTER 5518
Phew. I can still feel my heart 
pounding... Here, give me your 
hand and I'll show you.<PAGE>Oh stop. There's no reason 
to get all nervous just 
because it's nighttime.∀

## POINTER 5519
That's the Coliseum 
City for you! I can 
see fights every day! <PAGE>It's wonderful! 
Just wonderful!

## POINTER 5520
At one point, it got so wild 
in there, I thought people were 
going to start screaming.<PAGE>I wish I could have seen that. 
The more screaming, the more the 
excitement, don't you think?

## POINTER 5521
Covered in blood, burnt to a crisp, torn 
to shreds, 'til there's nothing left... 
It sends a thrill right down my spine.<PAGE>My tastes run a bit to the 
grotesque, you see.♪

## POINTER 5522
The matches have been so 
boring lately. It's always 
the same people.<PAGE>Why don't you all give 
it a go? You're 
here, aren't you?

## POINTER 5523
Then you can lose and wallow in 
the filth of your humiliation...<PAGE>My, my, whatever 
am I saying?♪

## POINTER 5524
A battle between a giant monster and the 
humans... If they were planning on staging 
this fight, why didn't anyone tell me?<PAGE>Someone apparently went for it not too long 
ago. They jumped on the monster's back.

## POINTER 5525
Now that you've come all this 
way, aren't you in the mood to 
see something really awful?

## POINTER 5526
I'm afraid I've become thoroughly 
addicted to the charms 
of the coliseum.<PAGE>So, I've made up my mind to live 
right here. I've got to save 
every last Gald that I can.

## POINTER 5527
I left my husband behind when I came here, 
but I'm not worried about him in the least.<PAGE>Coliseums before 
spouses!

## POINTER 5528
I originally lived in 
the capital, but I ended 
up moving here.<PAGE>I love the smell of the ocean, the 
views are spectacular, and best 
of all there's the coliseum!

## POINTER 5529
I left my husband behind when 
I came here, but he's lost in 
his own hobbies, so we're even.

## POINTER 5530
I left my husband behind in 
order to see the coliseum. I 
guess I am a little worried.<PAGE>Is he eating his dinner like he should? 
Is he cleaning up after himself?

## POINTER 5531
All my worries about my husband 
go up in smoke once the 
match begins, though.

## POINTER 5532
The town is just clogged with battleships. 
And it's filled to the brim with Knights.<PAGE>I'd thought this place would be different 
from the capital, but they're pretty 
much the same, after all.

## POINTER 5533
In this sort of situation, it's 
having the coliseum that makes 
living here worthwhile.

## POINTER 5534
I may not be from here originally, 
but I've quite settled in, and I've 
even made plenty of friends.<PAGE>My greatest pleasure is 
still the coliseum though, 
without a doubt.

## POINTER 5535
If I'm upset, when the 
match begins my worries 
fade a little.

## POINTER 5536
What is that now, 
in the sky?<PAGE>Ilyccia's off in that direction. Do you 
think the capital's all right? Husband...

## POINTER 5537
I'm worried about the husband 
I left behind in the capital...

## POINTER 5538
I've decided to return to the capital. And when 
I get back here, my husband will be with me.<PAGE>He'd be much better off 
coming here than staying 
there all alone.

## POINTER 5539
I like going to the matches by myself, 
but perhaps I'd enjoy the coliseum even 
more if he were here to watch with me.

## POINTER 5540
Howls of anguish in the air...
brother against brother...
pearlescent showers of blood...the mad roar of the crowd...It would be so delicious!<PAGE>I'm just kidding. 
Just kidding!♪

## POINTER 5541
Say, that monster in the sky...
what is it?<PAGE>It's so new and exciting... 
Even if it is the kind of monster that attacks people, 
I'd love to see it up close...

## POINTER 5542
Its first victim will 
be little...old...me!∀ 
Ah, the martyrdom of a tragic heroine.<PAGE>I'm just kidding. 
That would be awful!♪

## POINTER 5543
The coliseum is a cornucopia 
of thrills and excitement.<PAGE>But for some reason... 
it's just not enough anymore.

## POINTER 5544
The matches in the coliseum 
just don't satisfy me anymore.<PAGE>Why? 
What does it mean?

## POINTER 5545
This is the wharf. If you're 
looking to travel by sea, you'll 
be leaving from here.

## POINTER 5546
If you have your own personal ship 
you can come and go as you choose.♪

## POINTER 5547
This is the wharf. All ocean 
routes are under strict 
regulation at this time.

## POINTER 5548
I'd recommend not going out 
on the water right now.

## POINTER 5549
Leave me alone...

## POINTER 5550
Or, actually, what's the 
deal barging in here?

## POINTER 5551
No one will believe me, but I saw 
it, I did. I saw that monster 
with my own eyes, plain as day.<PAGE>Yes, it was on a night like tonight 
with a foul wind blowing.

## POINTER 5552
I took a wrong turn, quite by accident. And 
in that instant I saw it; a human being turning 
into some kind of beast... *Shiver...*

## POINTER 5553
Just what was that monster I 
saw in coliseum before...?<PAGE>While it was certainly terrifying, there 
was an even stronger sense of...holiness 
about it that gave me the chills.

## POINTER 5554
It very well may have 
been this town's 
guardian spirit.

## POINTER 5555
The air takes on a rarified quality at night, 
and has a disquieting odor about it.<PAGE>Sixth sense? It's nothing so superficial 
as that. Ill tidings are brewing 
though, mark my words...

## POINTER 5556
Please grant your protection 
to this town and its people, 
o guardian spirit...

## POINTER 5557
You're here to fight, aren't you? I 
can tell just by lookin' at your eyes. 
You're into this, aren't you?<PAGE>I can't think of anything I like 
better than to see guys like you 
wind up face down in the dirt.

## POINTER 5558
Hey, don't get bent outta shape. The monsters 
here are the real thing, even if they 
are for use in the tournaments.<PAGE>Don't be surprised if an enemy 
you're familiar with lays 
the hurt on you here.

## POINTER 5559
You guys are travelers, right? Lemme 
tell you straight up, this continent 
ain't worth your time.<PAGE>There's a road, but it dead ends at a mountain. There's a 
cave too, but it's chock-full of monsters. Plus, there's nothing 
but sand and jagged peaks waitin' on the other side.

## POINTER 5560
There's a town out there they 
call an oasis, but it's 
just another sand pit. <PAGE>Look, I won't say any more. 
You best get back on your ship 
and go home to mama, huh?

## POINTER 5561
Man, I don't like the looks 
of all these Knights bargin' 
in here like this.<PAGE>Most people out here have a strong 
dislike for the empire, so there could 
be trouble waitin' in the wings.

## POINTER 5562
Of course, I've got the privilege 
of sittin' back to see which 
way the chips fall.

## POINTER 5563
You say Belius has died? Okay, now 
things are gonna get interesting.<PAGE>Belius' existence was the thing that 
really kept this town together.

## POINTER 5564
Those Knights just keep on pouring in, one right 
after the other, don't they? Wonder how Palestralle's 
gonna dig themselves outta this one.<PAGE>This is awful, but it's also awesome. 
I'm gonna be so busy, hah hah.

## POINTER 5565
What's all this? Everybody seems to have 
quieted down a fair bit. Boring, I say.<PAGE>Or maybe it's that the Knights are 
puttin' their fears at ease.

## POINTER 5566
The people here turned out 
to have even less fight in 'em 
than I'd have guessed. <PAGE>I also assumed Belius 
had much more of a 
following than this.

## POINTER 5567
Ah hah hah. Now where the hell do you 
suppose a monster like that comes from. 
Nice, this is shapin' up nicely.<PAGE>What's that? The end of the world? 
Hah hah, aw heck, why not?

## POINTER 5568
They can wipe this town, or even 
the whole ball of wax clean off 
the map for all I care. Hmph.

## POINTER 5569
It sounds like there's a fair 
bit of trouble over on Ilyccia.<PAGE>We've got both the sea and the sky getting 
into the act now. How festive. I've got 
it, let's have a parade! Ah hah hah!

## POINTER 5570
...Okay even I can't keep it up anymore. 
Just what was I going on about, anyway?<PAGE>I feel like I'll have to 
face all my fears if I don't 
keep blabbering on...

## POINTER 5571
The monster that guarded over 
this town has been vanquished.<PAGE>If those who did this truly belong 
to one of the Union's guilds, 
they are a barbaric lot indeed.

## POINTER 5572
If that truly was the 
guardian spirit then 
this town is doomed.

## POINTER 5573
Now we've lost both Belius and the guardian 
spirit. It's hopeless to think we can 
rely on the Knights to protect us here.

## POINTER 5574
Natz is doing his best 
to fill in as provisional 
Duce of Nordopolica.<PAGE>Unlike Belius, he appears before 
the people frequently, and 
feels closer to us somehow.

## POINTER 5575
He lacks some of Belius' 
charisma, though we 
saw much less of her.

## POINTER 5576
Natz is pouring his heart into the 
work of keeping this town safe.<PAGE>Now the people need to rally 
behind him as one.

## POINTER 5577
There isn't much I know of other towns. 
But I'll be satisfied if Nordopolica 
can be at peace, of that I'm sure.

## POINTER 5578
I came to Desier to explore the lands 
to the west of here and search 
for my heritage as a Krityan.<PAGE>But the road through the 
mountains is out, and 
I was denied passage.

## POINTER 5579
If only I could conquer that mountain 
road somehow, the way forward after that 
should be flat and fairly easygoing.<PAGE>At least according to my map.

## POINTER 5580
There will surely be greater trials 
to face before I can finally discover 
my roots as a Krityan.<PAGE>Even if I were to cross the mountains, 
for example, a perilous desert spreads 
out beyond its far side.

## POINTER 5581
The only people likely to enter a desert 
are pioneering settlers, those with a severe 
case of wanderlust, and the insane.

## POINTER 5582
If all goes well, I may end up 
being able to work for the Duce 
directly in some capacity.

## POINTER 5583
Hoh hoh hoh.<PAGE>What the... *Pant* 
Heck are you... *Wheeze* 
Doing...?

## POINTER 5584
Whooee. I'd like to 
enter the tournament 
one of these days.<PAGE>I'm right in the middle of my training regimen. 
You've gotta toughen yourself up beforehand, see?

## POINTER 5585
Hoh hoh hoh... *Gasp, wheeze...* 
I've been doing this 
same run so much... *Pant* 
That it's boring me 
to tears... Wonder 
what I should do...

## POINTER 5586
Phew. Suppose I could head out of town... 
On second thought... I don't really 
want to tangle with the monsters...

## POINTER 5587
Hoh hoh hoh... *Huff, 
puff...* Those Knights 
are such a bother... 
*Gasp* Come on, stop 
looking over here... I-it's 
embarrassing...

## POINTER 5588
...What do they need the 
Knights for, anyway? They've 
got us, don't they...?

## POINTER 5589
Phew. Cados is under blockade, not 
to mention any travel by boat. And 
the mountain road is out to boot.<PAGE>Nordopolica's been sealed 
off tighter than a clam...

## POINTER 5590
Don don don dooooon!! Nooo... Oh my 
gosh, man... The Don, I can't believe 
the Don is dead and gone...!<PAGE>How will I...ever 
express my grief?!

## POINTER 5591
If only I'd 
been in Dahngrest...<PAGE>Don! Don, I never would've let you die! Don don don dooooon!!

## POINTER 5592
*Wheeze...* Just because the Don's 
passed away, *Pant* There's no excuse 
to go on pouting forever...<PAGE>*Gasp* Now I'm training in order to 
send that blasted monster back where 
it came from. *...Huff, puff*

## POINTER 5593
Phew... Wonder how buff I need to 
become before I've got a real shot 
at taking down that monster...

## POINTER 5594
*Gasp, wheeze...* Oh, I'm nowhere near 
finished... *Huff, puff* I've gotta keep 
on running... For tomorrow's sake...

## POINTER 5595
Whew... The road to victory 
is long a long and perilous 
one, huh...?

## POINTER 5596
This town is ruled autonomously 
by the guild, Palestralle. Their 
Boss is a woman known as Belius.<PAGE>The people here refer to 
her as the Duce though, 
as a show of respect.

## POINTER 5597
As wide as this world may be, 
Palestralle is the only guild 
that commands an entire city.<PAGE>In the case of Dahngrest, the 
power's shared between the 
Don and the Union, you see.

## POINTER 5598
The coliseum building is divided into three 
parts. The commercial district, the residential 
district, and the coliseum proper.<PAGE>To maintain public order, outsiders 
are strictly forbidden to 
take up residence here.

## POINTER 5599
I've heard that if one takes up official residency in this town, 
it's possible to live in the coliseum's residential district.<PAGE>Not that there's any guarantee 
life would be more interesting 
if you once you moved in.
