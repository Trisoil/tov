## POINTER 3200
Ohh...it was true. We simple laborers 
will never become nobility...<PAGE>To think we devoted absolutely everything 
working towards that goal...

## POINTER 3201
Looking back, I suppose I didn't 
lead such a bad life.<PAGE>The most important thing is to live every 
moment with all your heart and soul...

## POINTER 3202
Are you worried about something?<PAGE>The best remedy for a worried 
mind is hard work.

## POINTER 3203
I've labored hard, always 
being told that.

## POINTER 3204
Working in this town means great rewards!<PAGE>That's what I'd always been 
told...so I worked so hard...

## POINTER 3205
After the blastia incident,
I've been so scared
that I can't work...

## POINTER 3206
It feels like there are 
less residents now.<PAGE>Is it because of the 
blastia incident?

## POINTER 3207
Nothing has changed.<PAGE>All it means is a bigger workload 
to make up for the people lost...

## POINTER 3208
I cannot stop working. Work is something 
that must be continued. The act 
of continuing is work itself!<PAGE>That is all I have to live for.

## POINTER 3209
Continuation is power...

## POINTER 3210
I'm so bored of all this menial labor.<PAGE>How much longer until my shift ends...?

## POINTER 3211
Won't you all just shut up?!

## POINTER 3212
This town is finished. Putting 
in serious work here is a joke.

## POINTER 3213
Oh, man. How stupid it was 
of me working seriously.

## POINTER 3214
What people need in life is luck!<PAGE>Hard work doesn't 
even enter into it.

## POINTER 3215
When the time comes, 
everyone dies...that's 
all there is to it.

## POINTER 3216
Something has been bothering me lately...<PAGE>Everyone that's come to work here...do 
you think even one of them has ever 
actually been made a noble...?

## POINTER 3217
I'll never become 
nobility anyway!

## POINTER 3218
Welcome to Heliord, 
the newest addition to 
the empire's cities.

## POINTER 3219
Journey east to reach the port of Torim, 
and west to make for Dahngrest.

## POINTER 3220
This is the rising city of Heliord...
But...<PAGE>Lately, the residents have
been disappearing.

## POINTER 3221
Skipping town? No... 
It feels like something 
more sinister...

## POINTER 3222
Torim Port is east from the 
exit on the other side.<PAGE>If you need a boat, 
you should go there.

## POINTER 3223
Head west out of that exit 
to get to Dahngrest.<PAGE>The Guild Union 
is there.

## POINTER 3224
Torim Harbor is east from the exit
on the other side.<PAGE>The blastia may go crazy again,
so it might be convenient
if you need to escape.

## POINTER 3225
Head west out of
that exit to get to Dahngrest.<PAGE>I wouldn't recommend
escaping in that direction.

## POINTER 3226
Torim Harbor is east from the exit
on the other side.<PAGE>Caer Bocram is
out that way too.

## POINTER 3227
Head west out of
that exit to get to Dahngrest.<PAGE>It's the Guild Den where
all the disorderly gather.

## POINTER 3228
I cannot talk!

## POINTER 3229
I'm waiting for my turn.<PAGE>For your information, I 
have to go number two...

## POINTER 3230
Ohhh...please hurry up in there...

## POINTER 3231
No matter how much the world 
may change, there is at least 
one thing that will not.<PAGE>What goes in the body...must 
come out! Thus is the anima 
veritas: The truth of life!

## POINTER 3232
Neither diarrhea nor constipation faze me. Though 
the gates of my posterior may yearn to open, I shall 
never surrender, for they are sturdy, and...<PAGE>Forgive me. That may have 
been somewhat uncouth.

## POINTER 3233
Life is pleasant as long as 
one's appetite is satiated!<PAGE>However, it becomes quite unpleasant 
indeed if one cannot expel the 
natural results of such satiation!

## POINTER 3234
Oh, you were
brought here from upstairs too.<PAGE>At this hour,
all the adult workers are
at the construction site.

## POINTER 3235
A lot of people died
from working way
too hard.<PAGE>I don't want to grow up
to be expendable!

## POINTER 3236
It seems the adults have been
freed from forced labor.<PAGE>I wonder if Father
will come back...

## POINTER 3237
Isn't there anything we can do to improve 
the working environment here?<PAGE>I want to be able to do 
something for this town.

## POINTER 3238
Men work, and women watch the house...who 
made that rule up, anyway?<PAGE>In my opinion, women should get out of 
the house more, and be able to work.

## POINTER 3239
Ooh, I hate male chauvinism!

## POINTER 3240
They say men want two 
things: danger and play. 
Is that true? <PAGE>My mom tells me that 
kids shouldn't worry 
about those things...

## POINTER 3241
Then let me ask you this. The 
reason men want women...<PAGE>...is because we're the most dangerous 
plaything! Is that right?

## POINTER 3242
Just looking at the weathervane 
isn't going to make you rich.<PAGE>You have to predict from what direction 
the wind will spin it next!

## POINTER 3243
Of course, the best way to make 
your predictions reality is to 
force the wind to blow yourself.<PAGE>Yes...I'm going to have 
to set a trend!

## POINTER 3244
My family moved 
from the port town a 
little while back.<PAGE>My friends and I were writing letters 
back and forth, but I haven't gotten 
any letters from them in a while.

## POINTER 3245
I'm a little worried...

## POINTER 3246
My mommy and daddy really 
like each other...<PAGE>They kiss each other good morning, 
they kiss each other good night...they're 
always kissing!

## POINTER 3247
Mommy scolded me when 
I said that before...<PAGE>Why? Why do you think, 
mister? Why would 
mommy get so mad?

## POINTER 3248
Mommy always tells me 
to be a good girl...<PAGE>What do you think it means 
to be a good girl?

## POINTER 3249
If I'm not a good girl...does 
that make me a bad girl...?

## POINTER 3250
Mommy always says 
to be quiet in town...<PAGE>But she's talking 
all the time...

## POINTER 3251
Why do I have to be quiet?

## POINTER 3252
Ever since that fine young knight, 
Sir <STR>(FRE), came, we've 
been receiving a salary...<PAGE>I'm so thankful...

## POINTER 3253
I bought my daughter some shoes.<PAGE>I felt so sorry for her always walking around 
barefoot. It's dangerous, you know.

## POINTER 3254
Today was our payday. 
Tonight, real meat!<PAGE>It's the one thing I splurge on each month.

## POINTER 3255
Everyone has a big 
mouth, but...<PAGE>...the mouths of children really 
are bottomless pits, aren't they?

## POINTER 3256
I get so worried about what 
my daughter might be saying 
outside I can't leave him alone.

## POINTER 3257
It may be fun to gossip about 
other people, but...<PAGE>...it's not very pleasant when 
people gossip about you, is it?

## POINTER 3258
I suppose it can't be helped.<PAGE>That's just what 
small talk is.

## POINTER 3259
My grandson died on the job the other day...<PAGE>He always said working here would 
make him a noble some day...

## POINTER 3260
My grandson's death left an 
unoccupied position, so I've 
had to take over his job...<PAGE>At this age, heavy work from sunup 
to sundown isn't easy...

## POINTER 3261
Isn't there anything an old 
woman can do for this town?<PAGE>There must be something...

## POINTER 3262
I want to find something I can do, however 
small, to aid the excavations here.<PAGE>They say old age only begins when 
you lose your drive, you know.

## POINTER 3263
I've been allowed to start looking after 
the children at the orphanage.<PAGE>There was something this old 
woman could do, after all.

## POINTER 3264
Watching after the children isn't 
easy, but it's a job worth doing.<PAGE>Sometimes, I feel like I'm raising 
my own grandson again...

## POINTER 3265
The first step in raising a child right 
is to make them follow the rules.<PAGE>If they don't follow the basic 
rules, how will they make friends, 
and find partners some day?

## POINTER 3266
There are certain rules one 
must learn and abide by 
to function in society.<PAGE>Our job as adults is 
to ensure children 
learn these rules.

## POINTER 3267
Children are like mirrors that 
reflect the adults around them.<PAGE>Rather than bemoan our children's 
manners, it is essential that 
we set the right example.

## POINTER 3268
Even we grew up following 
our elders' examples...<PAGE>Children today are 
no different.

## POINTER 3269
I'm a very good cook.<PAGE>I'm going to do my best to provide the 
workers here with good, hot meals!

## POINTER 3270
Hmm...good, hot meals. Curry! 
That's the thing.

## POINTER 3271
What shall I prepare today?<PAGE>I may not have the finest ingredients 
at my disposal, but I look at it as a 
chance to show what I'm really made of.

## POINTER 3272
Good ingredients don't 
make good meals.<PAGE>It takes a good 
cook to do that.

## POINTER 3273
I like to think that cookery is something 
best done for people you love.

## POINTER 3274
Eating is what sustains 
our lives, right?<PAGE>That's why I believe that cooking 
for someone you love is also the 
act of protecting their life.

## POINTER 3275
The invention of a new 
dish is more useful than 
that of a new weapon.<PAGE>It doesn't take a genius to figure 
out that filling stomachs is more 
useful than killing people.

## POINTER 3276
How is that, you ask?<PAGE>Just think about it. If a wife cooks well, 
her husband doesn't cheat on her.

## POINTER 3277
I used to work upstairs,
but I was forced to
come down here...<PAGE>Cooking for the laborers,
morning and night...
There's no time to rest.

## POINTER 3278
I came from nearby village 
because I heard there 
were good jobs here.<PAGE>Now I regret having 
been so naive...

## POINTER 3279
I was supposed to be working as 
a maid in a noble's manor...<PAGE>Who could have imagined that noble 
would suddenly be brought to ruin...?

## POINTER 3280
Wait, I've got it!<PAGE>What if I start a cafe where all the 
waitresses dress like maids...?

## POINTER 3281
Do you like maid cafes?

## POINTER 3282
My customers tell me, 
"maids are so moe!".<PAGE>What does "moe" mean?

## POINTER 3283
It looks like my maid cafe 
was a giant success.<PAGE>Maybe I should open 
a cat-ears cafe next?

## POINTER 3284
What sorts of cafes 
do you like?<PAGE>Tsundere cafes?

## POINTER 3285
My latest business 
is a cosplay cafe!<PAGE>What kinds of uniforms 
do you like?

## POINTER 3286
My recommendations lately 
are nurse and nun outfits.

## POINTER 3287
I work as a delivery man.<PAGE>No matter what your job, labor 
is a very precious thing.

## POINTER 3288
Oh, I used to be a marine navigator 
for the pirate's guild, Siren's Fang.<PAGE>After the guild was no more, 
I took a land job, but I'm having 
trouble finding myself.

## POINTER 3289
"Liquor is the chief of all medicines." Didn't 
the people of old know how to put it best?<PAGE>All right! My work's done for today!

## POINTER 3290
I know they say, "drink the booze, 
don't let the booze drink you", but...<PAGE>...Hey, there's nothing wrong 
with a headache in the morning 
every once in a while, is there?

## POINTER 3291
Hey, I know liquor's poison to the 
body. You don't have to tell me.<PAGE>But what about the soul, eh? That's right. 
Booze is medicine for the soul.

## POINTER 3292
The time I spend drinking 
isn't wasted.<PAGE>Not at all. When I drink, my 
soul gets a chance to rest.

## POINTER 3293
"One cup, the man drinks the wine. Two 
cups, the wine drinks the wine. Three 
cups, the wine drinks the man."<PAGE>Hey, I know what the saying 
means...moderation, right?

## POINTER 3294
Liquor is a friend for life!

## POINTER 3295
Thanks to Sir <STR>(FRE), 
I get gruel to eat 
every night!<PAGE>I'm so happy.

## POINTER 3296
Before, I would always 
drink a whole bunch of 
water to get my belly full...

## POINTER 3297
Now I get bread to 
eat every night!<PAGE>I'm so happy.

## POINTER 3298
I got new clothes!<PAGE>I'm so happy.

## POINTER 3299
Now I get to eat 
meat every night!<PAGE>I'm so happy.
