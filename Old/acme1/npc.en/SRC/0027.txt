## POINTER 2700
Everyone's in a bad mood, 
but it doesn't mean 
nothin' to us kids!

## POINTER 2701

Tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet...

## POINTER 2702
I'm always happy 
as can be!♪

## POINTER 2703
Ka-donka-donk, 
donka-donk...

## POINTER 2704
Everyone else is in 
a bad mood, so I'm 
in a good one!

## POINTER 2705

Boom-boom, boom-bah-boom...!♪

## POINTER 2706
Let's do it to together! 
Come on...boom-boom, 
boom-bah-boom...!♪

## POINTER 2707
The coliseum really 
is massive when you 
see it up close.<PAGE>I suppose it's no surprise...there's enough 
room for people to live here, after all.

## POINTER 2708
I think you'd have to be a little 
bit mad to live in a coliseum.<PAGE>Day in, day out, people cheering 
and screaming...you'd never get
any rest.

## POINTER 2709
The town could even be built on such an 
uncivilized continent as this because it was 
suitable for making blastia.<PAGE>Don’t ask me why 
it was suitable. *Hic!*

## POINTER 2710
Same goes for the placement of the towns, too. 
Towns could be built because the place was 
suitable for the making barrier blastias. *Hic!*

## POINTER 2711
I think you'd have to be a little 
bit mad to live in a coliseum.<PAGE>Day in, day out, people cheering 
and screaming...you'd 
never get any rest.

## POINTER 2712
They say this coliseum 
city is incredibly old.<PAGE>Originally, it was just 
a grounds for duelling built 
in the wilderness.

## POINTER 2713
They say the stones of the duelling grounds have 
been wet with blood since the day they were set 
down. Isn't that a lurid way of putting it?

## POINTER 2714
Apparently, this city is governed by 
the descendants of an ancient clan.<PAGE>Only the top-ranking members 
of Palestralle, who rule the 
city, can ever meet them.

## POINTER 2715
I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't 
like to meet them...but they're just 
people like you and me, right?

## POINTER 2716
I hear very important Empire 
folk come to watch the 
tournaments sometimes.<PAGE>Of course, this town isn't even 
acknowledged by the Empire, so 
they must be coming in secret.

## POINTER 2717
You never know...the person you're 
sitting next to in the coliseum 
might actually be a princess.

## POINTER 2718
The Empire couldn't destroy this 
town even if they wanted to.<PAGE>Why not? It's simple. The big names 
from the Empire come here to 
have fun like everyone else.

## POINTER 2719
In fact, I bet they'd like to snatch 
this city away from Palestralle 
and run it under their auspices.

## POINTER 2720
You can see some giant shadow 
of a monster in the sky, but we're 
protected by the barrier.<PAGE>You know those huge pillars 
surrounding the city? Those are 
Nordopolica's barrier blastia.

## POINTER 2721
Apparently, most of the citizens 
don't even know that those 
are their barrier blastia.

## POINTER 2722
Entrance by sea 
is the only way 
into this city.<PAGE>I'm sure there will be ships full 
of refugees from Ilyccia sailing 
into port any day now.

## POINTER 2723
This town's going to get 
a whole lot livelier.<PAGE>Maybe it's time 
for me to be moving 
on myself...

## POINTER 2724
Yo! You kids come 
to see some hard-core 
action?<PAGE>The spectator tickets 
are platinum! Good 
luck getting some.

## POINTER 2725
Huh? Don't tell me you're 
here to compete.<PAGE>Look at your willowy little body! You 
wouldn't even last a single round.

## POINTER 2726
Fighting again? 
Don’t they ever get tired of it?<PAGE>Fighting is just a 
part of daily life.

## POINTER 2727
In this town, 
fighting is just 
like saying “Hi!”.<PAGE>Tourists just 
can’t understand it!

## POINTER 2728
They say the crowd went wild when 
the reigning champion went head-to-head 
with some upstart challenger!<PAGE>Man alive, how 
I regret not going 
to see that!

## POINTER 2729
What? YOU were the challenger? 
That's a pretty poor 
attempt at a joke.

## POINTER 2730
*Grumble-grumble*...don't 
talk to me...<PAGE>The coliseum is closed and I'm 
dealing with a lot of stress right 
now...*grumble-grumble*...

## POINTER 2731
Blast it all. Monsters escaped 
and it was a big to-do...*grumble-grumble*...

## POINTER 2732
The Duce was killed? No way 
Palestralle is going to 
stay quiet on this one.<PAGE>It's going to be all-out war. 
What a sight that'll be...

## POINTER 2733
So, who's the killer, anyway? 
I wonder who the all-out 
war will be with.

## POINTER 2734
Hmph. The Knights are 
so stern and gloomy.<PAGE>They'd do well to take a load off 
and watch some fights, you know?

## POINTER 2735
Aaargh, the Knights are so annoying! 
Can you tell me why they're 
so damned annoying?

## POINTER 2736
The monster in the 
sky? No big deal!<PAGE>You get all the Nordopolican 
toughs together, there isn't 
anything they can't beat.

## POINTER 2737
You hear me, monster?! 
Get down here and let's 
have us a fight!!

## POINTER 2738
First it was a flying monster, 
now it's some strange tower? 
Over in Aspio, was it?<PAGE>I hear that tower's almost 
like a monster itself.

## POINTER 2739
Why's it always cheap tricks like 
this, huh? You want a fight, come 
out and fight like a man!

## POINTER 2740
Come, come! Don't you want to 
hear the unerring predictions 
of Itoken, master tipster?<PAGE>You pay attention to my tips, 
you win big! No doubt about it!

## POINTER 2741
Coliseum mascot Itoken won't 
let you down! Just pay 
attention, you hear?<PAGE>In the next bout, Thea's 
the one to watch.

## POINTER 2742
Hey, you! Sonny! You've got 
nothing to lose lending an 
ear to Itoken the tipster!<PAGE>If Itoken's supernatural prognostication 
skills fail, you get back 
your every last Gald!

## POINTER 2743
You bend your knee to the brilliant Itoken, 
you're going to win. I guarantee it!<PAGE>Come on now, place your 
bets! Place your bets!

## POINTER 2744
It's the fabulous Itoken, he of 
the endless stream of victories!<PAGE>I haven't lost a bet since the 
day I was born! Come on and listen 
to what Itoken has to say!

## POINTER 2745
Inspiration's there for Itoken in a 
flash! He always has the answer! Come 
on, what have you got to lose?

## POINTER 2746
Itoken's brushed aside every adversity you 
can imagine! Itoken, fountain of luck, master 
tipster! You've got nothing to lose!<PAGE>Come on, have a listen, 
have a listen!

## POINTER 2747
Want to win? Listen to me! Lost already? 
Seriously consider listening to me!<PAGE>Show a little courage and listen 
to what Itoken has to say!

## POINTER 2748
Itoken may not be a great 
fighter, but his luck 
is second to none!<PAGE>Master tipster Itoken, in perfect 
form today, tomorrow, forever!

## POINTER 2749
Knights! Guildsmen! 
Listen to Itoken, he 
won't let you down!

## POINTER 2750
Itoken's there for you, rain 
or shine! It's always high 
tide on the Itoken Sea!<PAGE>Trust in Itoken's brilliance 
and bet with confidence! 
Come on, come on!

## POINTER 2751
No matter what happens, 
you'll never lose! Believe 
in Itoken's genius!

## POINTER 2752
The world may come to an end 
but somebody's gonna survive!<PAGE>Come on and listen to what luckmaster 
Itoken has to say!

## POINTER 2753
Itoken has no intention of losing 
yet! Come on and bet your life 
savings on Master Itoken!

## POINTER 2754
Seeing this older gentleman listening so 
intently makes me wonder...maybe this tipster's 
information really does pay off?<PAGE>I've never paid much attention 
to tipsters before. Should I 
try buying some information?

## POINTER 2755
When you think about it, 
why do tipsters even solicit 
their predictions?<PAGE>If they're so confident in their 
information, why not keep it a secret 
and place bets themselves?

## POINTER 2756
Suddenly a fight broke out! 
I was so surprised.<PAGE>I'm sure it was over something stupid...
“I like grilled meat!” 
“Well I like fried meat! Take that!” bah...

## POINTER 2757
They fight for any little reason...
They shouldn’t fight 
over such stupid things.

## POINTER 2758
Hmm...hmm. I see. I thought this tipster 
might have just been spouting his mouth 
off, but he's definitely talking sense.<PAGE>This could work...maybe 
I'll buy a tip 
after all.

## POINTER 2759
My first impression of this fellow was 
that he was a muscle-bound dolt, but 
he's actually quite the intellectual.<PAGE>You really cannot judge 
people by their looks.

## POINTER 2760
Listen! I followed this tipster's 
information and won two 
hundred thousand Gald!<PAGE>Itoken, I'm so glad 
I trusted you!

## POINTER 2761
Next I'm going to bet five hundred 
thousand on a real dark horse!<PAGE>Go, go!!

## POINTER 2762
It's so uncomfortable with the 
Knights around. I always feel 
like I'm being watched.<PAGE>Is it even safe 
to be placing 
bets here?

## POINTER 2763
We won't be...caught, 
will we?

## POINTER 2764
Ohh...woe is me...what? You're asking if 
I'm sad because of the Duce's death?<PAGE>No! I'm sad because I'm 
out fifty thousand Gald!

## POINTER 2765
Ohh...woe 
is me...

## POINTER 2766
Ooh...I'm going to dig out the two million 
Gald I have in my purse and bet it 
all! I'm winning my money back!<PAGE>Itoken! Let me hear 
your predictions!

## POINTER 2767
The sky? I don't have any time to think 
about it! My life is on the line, here!

## POINTER 2768
I lost...I lost...what's 
wrong with this 
tipster?<PAGE>I...I haven't been 
cheated, have I?

## POINTER 2769
I suppose I should be thankful 
I still have my life...

## POINTER 2770
This tipster here, Itoken...he once 
picked a dark horse that won against 
hundred thousand-to-one odds.<PAGE>I reckoned I didn't have anything to 
lose, so I followed his tip. I never 
imagined it would pay out so well.

## POINTER 2771
That bet netted me an almost 
unthinkable amount of Gald. 
It was like paradise...<PAGE>Yet ever since then, neither Itoken 
nor I have picked any winners. Now all 
I have left to my name is debt...

## POINTER 2772
Itoken has quite the silver tongue. He 
manages to convince himself his predictions 
are sound even when they fail.<PAGE>I must be a generous man...I 
fall for his smart talk 
again and again.

## POINTER 2773
This noble lady beside me is 
placing quite a large bet...perhaps 
I will as well.<PAGE>How lucky I'd be if this paid off 
and I was able to get out of debt.

## POINTER 2774
Itoken fingered a dark horse worth 
five hundred thousand...!<PAGE>What an old fool I am! Why 
now, of all times, did I decide 
to get cold feet...

## POINTER 2775
The noble lady beside 
me won big...<PAGE>Surely she could spare 
a few Gald now...

## POINTER 2776
Itoken's tips never 
pan out, do they?<PAGE>It's incredible he's able to stay 
in business with nothing but talk.

## POINTER 2777
Why do I even keep 
on buying Itoken's 
tips...?

## POINTER 2778
What a dupe...this noble lady 
just bet her entire fortune 
on one of Itoken's tips.<PAGE>I suppose that's just the pot 
calling the kettle black...

## POINTER 2779
Poor Belius has died...this 
is no time to 
be gambling...<PAGE>But I can't stop. 
It's an addiction.

## POINTER 2780
He's never right...this so-called tipster 
is nothing but a clump of bad luck.<PAGE>Even so, his business is booming. 
How nice it must be to be ignorant.

## POINTER 2781
Hey...when you think about it, he's 
not losing a single Gald, is he?<PAGE>His tips aren't worth a whit and he 
keeps on squeezing money out of us!

## POINTER 2782
I don't know how much longer I have left 
to live. If I can just win one more 
bet, have one final good memory...<PAGE>But still, I lose. Does 
this cruel tipster even 
care about my feelings?

## POINTER 2783
The end is nigh...if we're all going 
to be destroyed anyway, perhaps 
bankruptcy isn't so bad...

## POINTER 2784
This is my first time at the coliseum. 
Everything was so shocking, and 
I got a bit too excited...<PAGE>Now I'm just taking in a little 
sea breeze to calm myself down.

## POINTER 2785
Whew...my heart is still 
pounding. Here, touch 
my chest and see.<PAGE>Hey, I'm just kidding, 
you know.♪

## POINTER 2786
That's the Coliseum City 
for you! I can see 
fights every day! <PAGE>It's wonderful! 
Just wonderful!

## POINTER 2787
Can I see a bit 
more blood...?<PAGE>I lied, 
I’m just kidding!

## POINTER 2788
What’s happened!? 
An old man wearing explorer’s 
clothes ran out of the town.<PAGE>What’s that!? Trouble you say? 
Ah, I’m so excited!

## POINTER 2789
Great, that’s what I love about this town!<PAGE>There’s cheating everyday...<PAGE>Ahhh, I mean...Picking?...
not learning...
hiking...?

## POINTER 2790
The crowd was going crazy a 
little while ago. You could 
even hear screams of pain.<PAGE>I wish I had been there to see 
it. The louder the screams, 
the more exciting it is...

## POINTER 2791
Bloody flesh...blackened bones...shredded 
skin...scattered entrails...it's 
all so thrilling.<PAGE>Hey, I'm just kidding! I sure 
have a sick mind, huh?♪

## POINTER 2792
All the matches are so boring 
lately. It's always the 
same old fighters.<PAGE>You're already here in 
Nordopolica. How about 
you step in the ring?

## POINTER 2793
Of course, you'll just lose 
and die a dog's death.<PAGE>Tee-hee, I'm just kidding! 
What a big mouth I have.♪

## POINTER 2794
If they're going to have such big, 
exciting matches, why don't they 
advertise them beforehand?<PAGE>They just held an event with people against 
giant monsters. And it was a walk-in!

## POINTER 2795
Look, we came all the way here. 
That's the kind of ridiculous 
thing we want to see, right?

## POINTER 2796
Ooh, I just had a great idea. 
Why not pit knights against 
guildsmen in the coliseum?<PAGE>Now, wouldn't that be exciting?∀

## POINTER 2797
Howls of anguish! Brother against brother! 
Showers of blood! The mad roar of 
the crowd... Oh, how wonderful!<PAGE>I'm kidding! 
I'm kidding!♪

## POINTER 2798
Say, that monster in 
the sky...what is it?<PAGE>It's so new and exciting...even if it 
is the kind of monster that attacks 
people, I'd love to see it up close...

## POINTER 2799
It’s first victim will be little...old...me!∀ 
Ah, the martyrdom of a tragic heroine.<PAGE>I'm just kidding. That 
would be awful!♪
