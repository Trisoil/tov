It's gonna take her gettin' 
herself killed, before she 
comes to her senses.

## POINTER 5301
That fool-headed granddaughter of mine's 
gone out to sea again. Never mind that blasted 
monster hanging up there in the sky.

## POINTER 5302
World's never seen a more stubborn girl. I 
just can't figure out who she got it from.

## POINTER 5303
That senile old man's forgotten 
that he's the one who 
gave me my boat!<PAGE>If he's gonna give it to me, 
shouldn't I be the one who 
decides what I do with it?!

## POINTER 5304
Besides, he's the one to 
blame for me liking the 
sea as much as I do...

## POINTER 5305
Of course I know all about the ocean being 
a dangerous place, and all that.

## POINTER 5306
But dangerous or not, 
there's some things a 
girl's just gotta do.

## POINTER 5307
I've got to go out on the ocean, even if Grandpa's 
dead set against it. I'm trying to make 
a lifelong dream come true out there.

## POINTER 5308
I'm carrying on the dreams my 
grandpa had, back in the days 
when he was still a sailor.

## POINTER 5309
My daughter and my old dad get into it 
with each other at the drop of a hat.<PAGE>You'd think they'd get along so well... I guess 
they're just a little too much of the same kind.

## POINTER 5310
Besides, it isn't as 
if they don't really 
care for each other.

## POINTER 5311
They'd understand one another better if they could just talk 
things out, but they're both stubborn as stone. Whoever heard 
of granddaughter and grandpa who do nothing but fight?

## POINTER 5312
I think they're both just too afraid of 
talking to each other face to face.

## POINTER 5313
Even I'll admit that I'm not thrilled 
to have my daughter out on the 
water in these conditions...

## POINTER 5314
She's never been a girl who listens to 
anything but her own heart, though.

## POINTER 5315
Well now, we met back at 
Deidon Hold, did we not?<PAGE>Have you changed your mind 
about working for me?

## POINTER 5316
After we met, the Hold was reopened 
and I was able to get back to town.<PAGE>If it had been even a little later, I wouldn't have 
been able to cross the sea because of the storms.

## POINTER 5317
※It may be better not to place Kaufman here.

## POINTER 5318
With a person such as that, you don't 
realize how valuable they truly 
are until after they're gone.

## POINTER 5319
It's only now that I can see just how big 
a hole the Don created when he went away.

## POINTER 5320
But business goes on. Fortune's Market's got 
to continue living up to its reputation, 
and rake that money in by the boat load.

## POINTER 5321
If you spend all your time worrying 
about the people that aren't with us 
anymore, you'll never get anywhere.

## POINTER 5322
The empire is in a state of disarray at the 
moment. But helping them clean up the mess 
is going to mean booming business for us.

## POINTER 5323
Hmm, the Knights or the future emperor? Which do 
you think will perform better in the long term? 
Which sounds like the better investment to you?

## POINTER 5324
With the world gone mad like this, there's no real point 
worrying about things like running a business.

## POINTER 5325
We've been sending relief supplies to all the affected 
regions, and that's cost us a pretty penny.<PAGE>We should work together to 
recover our losses in the 
future, don't you think?

## POINTER 5326
This is Fortune Market's 
home office.<PAGE>The President's busy right 
now. Don't be a nuisance.

## POINTER 5327
This is Fortune Market's 
home office.<PAGE>Leave the president alone. 
You'd only be in the way.

## POINTER 5328
Don's death is beginning to 
take it's toll on Fortune's 
Market in numerous ways.

## POINTER 5329
The President's been even more busy than usual, since 
it happened. Make sure not to get in her way.

## POINTER 5330
The President can smell a good business 
opportunity from a mile away.

## POINTER 5331
The President's in the middle of sealing a crucial deal 
today. You'd better not make a nuisance of yourselves.

## POINTER 5332
If there's power in military might, then there's just 
as much power in things like trade and finance. Fortune's 
Market can use things like that to move mountains.

## POINTER 5333
The President's been in a good mood today. But don't 
go getting any ideas about interrupting her work.

## POINTER 5334
The President is quite the humanitarian. 
I think that's what I 
like best about her.

## POINTER 5335
I doubt she'll ask to be repaid 
for all she's done once 
peace finally returns...

## POINTER 5336
...Life is pretty sweet 
here in this town...<PAGE>The people are friendly, the temperature's 
just about right, and above all...we've 
got the President...

## POINTER 5337
...I'd prefer if you kept this on the down low, but...<PAGE>I think the President 
smells really nice...

## POINTER 5338
Another day spent at the President's side. 
There is no joy greater than this.

## POINTER 5339
...I'd prefer if you kept this on the down low, but...<PAGE>The President won't wear anything she thinks makes her look fat.

## POINTER 5340
...I'd prefer if you kept this on the down low, but...<PAGE>The President goes absolutely livid 
if anyone calls her "ma'am."

## POINTER 5341
...I'd prefer if you kept this on the down low, but...<PAGE>The President loves all things having to do with money.

## POINTER 5342
...I'd prefer if you kept this on the down low, but...<PAGE>The President has no interest in getting married.

## POINTER 5343
...I'd prefer if you kept this on the down low, but...<PAGE>The President never takes off her glasses.

## POINTER 5344
What business do you have at this hour? <PAGE>This is Aspio. If you wish 
to enter, I'll need 
to see your passport.

## POINTER 5345
We don't get many visitors 
from the outside, here.<PAGE>This town's full of mages who've got 
nothing but research on the brain.<PAGE>I feel like I'm gonna go nuts, 
fenced in by all these weirdos.

## POINTER 5346
Nighttime or noon, it makes no difference to these 
researchers. They're all nutty as fruitcakes.

## POINTER 5347
Some truly savage monsters come 
out at night. You've been warned.

## POINTER 5348
The color of the sky seems odd off 
in the direction of the capital.<PAGE>Wonder if everything's okay.

## POINTER 5349
There've been no orders from the capital... 
What could've happened to the Knights?

## POINTER 5350
This facility is under the direct jurisdiction 
of the empire. Please be on your 
way if you have no business here.

## POINTER 5351
If you've lost your way, you can reach Halure by heading to the 
southwest, and you'll find Deidon Hold directly to the south.<PAGE>It's gotten pretty 
late. Take care, 
and stick to 
the roads.

## POINTER 5352
Take a rest for 100 Gald? It is 
a bookshelf, you understand.

## POINTER 5353
We're used to it around here, but you 
may find it a bit stiff if it's your 
first time. Stop back anytime.

## POINTER 5354
Oh, wonderful! Now I've lost my concentration. 
You're quite disturbing my research, you know. 
Perhaps you could...go somewhere else?

## POINTER 5355
Okay, that's it! I was so close...I 
simply can't think with you 
talking to me like that!!

## POINTER 5356
Are you kidding me?! You again?! 
Don't talk to me right now, this 
is the most important part!!

## POINTER 5357
I've completed the system of calculations!! 
I've done it!! ...Huh? Where 
did all you people come from?<PAGE>...Huh? When did it 
get so dark? Did 
something happen?

## POINTER 5358
Sorry, but I'm afraid we can't let you handle 
the blastia just because it's nighttime.

## POINTER 5359
Well, it doesn't matter whether it's 
night or day for us researchers!! <PAGE> Well... It's more like it doesn't 
matter in this town...

## POINTER 5360
You... You're the ones that snuck into the 
ruins, aren't you? You can't have anything 
nice without amateurs mucking it up.

## POINTER 5361
We were the ones given rights to enter 
those ruins... Curse that Mordio, she's 
beaten us to the punch once again...

## POINTER 5362
You caught that blastia thief, as well, right? I don't 
see Mordio around, either. Oh, whatever will happen 
to the results of her precious research...? Tee-hee.♪

## POINTER 5363
If she doesn't get her results together 
and publish them soon...

## POINTER 5364
The sky's turned an odd color?<PAGE>Well, it is night, right? Of course 
it's going to look different.

## POINTER 5365
You say we're in danger? What 
are you even talking about?<PAGE>The blastia we're excavating now are showing 
more activity than ever before. This is 
the perfect chance to run experiments!

## POINTER 5366
Zzz.

## POINTER 5367
I'll never let anyone...have my 
blastia... *Mumble, grumble...*

## POINTER 5368
Whoa...do I actually think the 
blastia on Ehmead Hill is...cute? 
*Mumble, mumble...*

## POINTER 5369
Man...those guys in the 
Knights...are so cool. 
*Mumble, mumble...*

## POINTER 5370
Is the barrier malfunctioning...or 
did it just stop working? 
*Mumble, mumble..."

## POINTER 5371
Research... 
Must do more research... 
*Mumble, mumble...*

## POINTER 5372
It's pretty rare for Mordio 
to cooperate with anyone.

## POINTER 5373
What does Halure having 
beautiful nights have to 
do with blastia research? <PAGE>Or are you trying to say 
something about this town...?

## POINTER 5374
If the blastia are in good condition, our 
research can progress. ...Huh? It's night 
already? I'll keep going a while longer.

## POINTER 5375
The blastia we're digging 
up here were made by the 
Krityans eons ago.

## POINTER 5376
An abnormal environment in the capital..... 
I wonder if this is caused by 
the aer abnormality?

## POINTER 5377
I wonder if there are fewer guards at night? 
Maybe I could even sneak into 
that closed-off area... *Mumble, mumble*

## POINTER 5378
Hmm...? 
The management list and the number of Blastia 
don't match.....

## POINTER 5379
My mistake? 
I've been so forgetful 
lately...

## POINTER 5380
It's so rare to have brought Mordio 
with you.

## POINTER 5381
Are you guys chasing something like the Blastia again?

## POINTER 5382
If Mordio is not here, the research 
doesn't go smoothly and I get stressed out.

## POINTER 5383
Can you get your business 
wrapped up earlier? <PAGE>I want you to help my research 
as soon as possible.

## POINTER 5384
Are you researching on the abnormality of the 
Shield Blastia that is the barrier of the capital?

## POINTER 5385
Lately, 
the Blastia on the hillside shows abnormal figures, 
although......

## POINTER 5386
If you have time to spare, why don't you check on 
the Blastia on the hillside.

## POINTER 5387
The Blastia excavated here 
were all made by the Kritya 
long, long ago.

## POINTER 5388
Just once I'd like to have a nice, long 
talk with one of the Krityan technicians 
about blastia construction.

## POINTER 5389
Halure? Yeah, it's known for having the textbook 
example of an organic-type blastia.<PAGE>What about it?

## POINTER 5390
We spend all our time inside the city, so 
we're a bit out of touch with the world.<PAGE>Not that I'm dying to know what's happening out there.

## POINTER 5391
Saying that though, somebody had to 
put all these blastia we're digging 
up into the ground at some point...<PAGE>I wonder if it was done for some special reason?

## POINTER 5392
Hey, would you mind leaving 
me alone? I'm busy thinking 
about blastia right now.

## POINTER 5393
Why would they bury 
the blastia...? 
Hmm, I wonder.<PAGE>...Did they become unusable? 
But how could that happen?

## POINTER 5394
How could they just give up using 
something that brings such convenience 
and abundance to our lives...?

## POINTER 5395
Wait, what's up with this? These numbers 
can't be right! There's something 
fishy about the recent data!!<PAGE>All my work, my precious work!!

## POINTER 5396
Astounding. These results will overturn 
something people have been accepting as 
fact for far too long. It's incredible!!

## POINTER 5397
I've heard news that a vandal got into the ruins to the southeast. 
That place has been checked from top to bottom, though.<PAGE>I can't imagine they'd 
find much there.

## POINTER 5398
If the tree blastia of Halure was able to maintain 
its organic powers as it evolved...<PAGE>Then perhaps it's possible to hard wire 
humans to evolve in the same way.

## POINTER 5399
Do you mind giving me some space? I'm right 
in the middle of puzzling out the connection 
between organics and the human body.
