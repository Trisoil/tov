## POINTER 1000
What's going on? 
Go check it out 
and let me know!

## POINTER 1001
It's times like these Fortune's 
Market has to get all the 
other guilds motivated!

## POINTER 1002
We've got some good stuff!

## POINTER 1003
Say, you folks there! How'd 
you like a rest? We're fully 
sanctioned by the inn guild.

## POINTER 1004
You'll feel like you slept three 
days in one night! Dinner's on us! 
...Don't miss your chance!

## POINTER 1005
Wh-why isn't the barrier 
blastia working?!

## POINTER 1006
I just don't know 
about those Knights. 
They sure were late.

## POINTER 1007
We really need the 
Don in this town.

## POINTER 1008
Say, did you hear? 
That cool knight 
got arrested!

## POINTER 1009
Kind of a shame. 
He looked so cool...

## POINTER 1010
Barbos made plenty of 
trouble for this inn, too.

## POINTER 1011
He finally showed 
his true colors.

## POINTER 1012
The Don himself has stayed 
at this inn. Surely you'd 
like to stay too?

## POINTER 1013
We still have vacancies! Hurry 
up! First come, first served!

## POINTER 1014
Wh-why is something 
like this happening?!

## POINTER 1015
The Don instigated the 
attack on Nordopolica?<PAGE>I'm starting to smell 
conflict coming...

## POINTER 1016
Oh, it wasn't the Don? It 
was his grandson, Harry?<PAGE>What is he thinking? 
What a stupid kid.

## POINTER 1017
Hey, you, isn't this 
getting out of hand?<PAGE>Are they seriously 
thinking of going up 
against Nordopolica?

## POINTER 1018
The people of 
Palestralle are tough.<PAGE>What'll we do if 
they overthrow 
this town?

## POINTER 1019
The Don... 
Those eyes... 
They're the eyes of resolution...

## POINTER 1020
The Don... 
I thought this day would 
come sooner or later...

## POINTER 1021
The poor Don... 
It's gonna be lonely 
around here.

## POINTER 1022
Our young people will 
really have to get their 
acts together now.

## POINTER 1023
It sounds like things 
could get ugly over in 
the Empire, doesn't it?

## POINTER 1024
Of course, I'd welcome anything
that weakened the Empire.

## POINTER 1025
What on earth is going on?

## POINTER 1026
I don't understand 
anything anymore!

## POINTER 1027
A traveler told me 
he went to Yurzorea.<PAGE>He said he saw Nifil Lake on the 
southern side of the continent 
all dried up. What is going on?

## POINTER 1028
I wonder if Nifil Lake, in 
southern Yurzorea dried up 
because of that monster...

## POINTER 1029
Getting attacked by a huge 
pack of monsters right after 
arriving, huh... Having fun yet?

## POINTER 1030
You say the Empire is coming 
to attack? Well, well. That's 
not very peaceful at all, is it?

## POINTER 1031
That Ragou was quite 
a scoundrel, wasn't he?

## POINTER 1032
Just thinking about 
how he lived so comfortably 
makes my guts churn.

## POINTER 1033
There's no way 
we can make nice 
with the Empire!

## POINTER 1034
It'd be fine if they were 
all as nice as that young 
knight who was here before.

## POINTER 1035
The Don is a great man.

## POINTER 1036
What are monsters 
doing in the town?! Did 
the Empire's do this?!

## POINTER 1037
Citizen evacuation has top 
priority! Those who can 
fight, take up your swords!

## POINTER 1038
The only reason we managed to 
get out of that mess with minimum 
losses is our Union's leadership.

## POINTER 1039
The Empire is supposedly 
going to attack. We need 
to tighten up security.

## POINTER 1040
We need to tighten 
up security.

## POINTER 1041
That damn Barbos... 
I'll never forgive him.

## POINTER 1042
I'd never forgive anyone 
who violated this town.

## POINTER 1043
After Barbos was taken 
care of, this town got 
a lot more peaceful.

## POINTER 1044
I'm just glad Dahngrest is 
back to its good, old self.

## POINTER 1045
If only we could sign a treaty 
of friendship with the Empire,
work would be so much simpler.

## POINTER 1046
The day my job gets easy 
is the day we're at peace.

## POINTER 1047
The Empire isn't our only 
enemy! We can't forget 
about the monsters.

## POINTER 1048
But can anyone really hope
to defeat that thing...?

## POINTER 1049
Something is giving me 
a very bad feeling... 
What's going to happen?

## POINTER 1050
For some reason, 
bad feelings always 
seem to come true.

## POINTER 1051
I never even thought 
about what might happen 
if the Don died.

## POINTER 1052
If we had just done 
our job a little better...

## POINTER 1053
The Don's dead now...
Zaphias can go to 
hell for all I care.

## POINTER 1054
I hope the Empire
loses its center and 
completely collapses.

## POINTER 1055
Hey, you don't think the 
world's going to be destroyed 
or anything, do you?

## POINTER 1056
Damn! What are we 
supposed to do about 
that thing in the sky?

## POINTER 1057
That bastard Harry... 
He never grows up
does he?<PAGE>The fate of the Union...
isn't looking good...

## POINTER 1058
Harry's a pretty 
good worker. <PAGE>But compared to his 
grandfather, he's just 
got no backbone.

## POINTER 1059
Things sure are lively. All thanks 
to the Don and the Union... 
No no, I'm just talking to myself!

## POINTER 1060
Boss Barbos would have 
my head if heard me saying 
anything nice about the Don.

## POINTER 1061
This ain't good at all! 
The smart thing to do 
is make a break for it!

## POINTER 1062
Well that was a surprise! 
Guess things like this 
really do happen...

## POINTER 1063
No, no...I didn't run! 
We fought all proper-like. 
Me too!

## POINTER 1064
They should just hurry 
up and kill all the 
knights they captured!<PAGE>...Wh-what, you got a 
problem with that...?

## POINTER 1065
...Wh-what, you got 
a problem with that...?

## POINTER 1066
Look, it's not 
like I'm a Barbos
fan or anything...

## POINTER 1067
S-seriously, I'm not!

## POINTER 1068
With Barbos dead,
the Blood Alliance
is finished...

## POINTER 1069
Jobs are gonna get 
scarce without the Blood 
Alliance around anymore...

## POINTER 1070
We're supposed to be friendly
with the Empire now? No way!

## POINTER 1071
What, are we supposed to all 
hold hands with the Knights and 
play pattycake? What a joke!

## POINTER 1072
Just being in this town makes 
me feel like I'm going to get 
wrapped up in something bad.

## POINTER 1073
It might be smart to wait 
for the right time and just 
get away from this town.

## POINTER 1074
This is bad... I was just 
hanging out, and I got 
caught up in this mess.<PAGE>What's up with guilds
fighting each other?!

## POINTER 1075
This is no time to 
just wander around...<PAGE>Ugh...I hate how 
lazy I am...

## POINTER 1076
First Barbos, 
now the Don?

## POINTER 1077
Just think about it... 
The heads of two of the five 
master guilds are dead.

## POINTER 1078
What's going
to happen now?

## POINTER 1079
What should I do?

## POINTER 1080
I don't know what to do!

## POINTER 1081
Someone do something!

## POINTER 1082
The air around this town is 
unstable, refracting the sunlight 
and turning the sky red.<PAGE>But no one knows 
why the air has 
been so unstable.

## POINTER 1083
So now this town is in 
a perpetual sunset.<PAGE>It's kind of sad 
and depressing...

## POINTER 1084
The monsters' numbers count 
for nothing! We shall rout 
them and drive them back!!

## POINTER 1085
Those monsters... They looked 
like the ones I fought in Keiv 
Moc... I wonder why...

## POINTER 1086
......The forest ofKeiv Moc?
It's southwest from this town.

## POINTER 1087
First monsters... Now 
the Empire... 
How pathetic...

## POINTER 1088
I have no interest 
in peoples' squabbles.

## POINTER 1089
The chief would say 
the same thing. 
No interest at all.

## POINTER 1090
Ragou? 
Hmph, I could care 
less about him.<PAGE>So what if a guy like 
that falls from power? 
I don't feel a thing.

## POINTER 1091
Isn't there a monster out there 
that can move the heart 
more than a human?

## POINTER 1092
So... What monsters should 
I go hunting next?

## POINTER 1093
Hmm... Maybe I 
should rejoin the 
chief and his men.

## POINTER 1094
I gotta hurry and 
tell the chief about 
that monster.

## POINTER 1095
Monsters are evil.
The Hunting Blades
exist to hunt them.

## POINTER 1096
I hear the chief and 
his men did quite a 
job in Nordopolica.

## POINTER 1097
Apparently they took out 
all the monsters there.

## POINTER 1098
Whoa, whoa, whoa! The 
Don dies because of some 
work the bosses did?<PAGE>Isn't that a little 
over-the-top?

## POINTER 1099
You could roast him, burn him, 
fry him up for breakfast... 
The Don won't die!
