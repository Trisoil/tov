## POINTER 3400
It sounds like some 
sort of explosion. 
What was that?

## POINTER 3401
Repairing the blastia 
is a job for mages.<PAGE>Petty negotiations 
are a job for Knights 
of lower birth.

## POINTER 3402
Me? I have been given the 
noble task of supervising 
by Sir Cumore!

## POINTER 3403
I swear, the commoners 
are completely 
useless. <PAGE>They just let the blastia 
run out of control? What 
were they thinking?!

## POINTER 3404
It seems that we, the 
nobility, need to keep 
a closer eye on them.

## POINTER 3405
Those commoners... They claim that there 
are no class divisions among Knights.<PAGE>Grrrr... They make 
me so angry!

## POINTER 3406
Only 5 years since the regime 
change, and already the nobility 
are being ignored.

## POINTER 3407
This city is growing
thanks to us, the Cumore Brigade
and our management of the people!<PAGE> In all cases, the commoners
should be under the control of the nobility!

## POINTER 3408
Glory to Heliord,
the city built by nobles!

## POINTER 3409
I knew he would do it. That 
<STR>(FRE)... He's some Knight.<PAGE>I am fortunate to 
serve under him.

## POINTER 3410
Self-indulgent fools like 
Cumore never succeed.

## POINTER 3411
I've served under a number 
of ineffectual superiors...<PAGE>The less effectual, the better they 
believe they are. Dealing with people 
like that is so difficult...

## POINTER 3412
But this <STR>(FRE) seems 
to be an exception.<PAGE>A good commander never sticks his head 
in where he doesn't belong, and doesn't 
leave everything to his subordinates.

## POINTER 3413
Authorities may have a position above 
those of other men, but that doesn't 
mean they can look down on them.<PAGE>Instead, they need a humility that 
allows them to see things from the 
same point of view as everyone else.

## POINTER 3414
<STR>(FRE) passes that test.

## POINTER 3415
We are loyal to our Empire, but perhaps a 
better way of putting it would be to say we 
are loyal to the people who support us...<PAGE>...our family 
and friends.

## POINTER 3416
Protecting this city as part of the 
<STR>(FRE) Brigade is just one way to 
show our love for Captain <STR>(FRE).<PAGE>...What?
Don't look at 
me like that.

## POINTER 3417
Training and discipline is unlikely 
to produce quick results.<PAGE>Even so, one must never abandon 
their daily training.

## POINTER 3418
I believe.<PAGE>I believe that difficult 
training is always rewarded...

## POINTER 3419
This is a facility for the Imperial 
Knights. You should leave if 
you have no business here.<PAGE>There is nothing 
here for you.

## POINTER 3420
It is sad that people 
avoid us just because 
we're Knights.<PAGE>However, that is a burden 
we must bear as Knights.

## POINTER 3421
...
You think you're 
gonna stay here? You're 
gonna pay 100 Gald.

## POINTER 3422
You get to stay here thanks 
to Sir Cumore. You 
should be grateful.

## POINTER 3423
Sorry. We're not opened 
for business yet. <PAGE>Please come again.

## POINTER 3424
I said we're not ready.
Come back later.

## POINTER 3425
Would you like to
stay for 350 Gald?

## POINTER 3426
Thank you very much.
Enjoy your stay.

## POINTER 3427
We knights usually have severe training 
from morning to night...<PAGE>What's worse, we always have to be on 
the scene first if there's a situation.

## POINTER 3428
Frankly, I regret joining the Knights. 
This simply isn't a decent job.

## POINTER 3429
Situations are rare where 
we would be able to use the 
training we do every day.<PAGE>I'm starting to feel like 
the training is useless.

## POINTER 3430
Uhh...what are we supposed 
to do at a time like this?

## POINTER 3431
All that ridiculously difficult training was 
just our captain tormenting his underlings...

## POINTER 3432
I can tell you firsthand that our regular training 
wasn't going to be good for anything.

## POINTER 3433
The reason we Knights train so 
diligently day in and day out is because 
there are people we must protect.

## POINTER 3434
What is your training for?<PAGE>You can't consider training meaningful unless 
you think about such things yourself.

## POINTER 3435
Something is rotten in the town of Heliord!<PAGE>The people exploiting the laborers live in luxury 
and the laborers struggle in poverty!

## POINTER 3436
Do people leave because 
the work becomes a rush?<PAGE>Or do people leave because 
it's rushed work...? 
Oh, don't mind me.

## POINTER 3437
Welcome. What are 
you looking for?

## POINTER 3438
Welcome.
I got some new weapons in!
Take a look and buy what you like.

## POINTER 3439
...You know, the Cumore Brigade
is made up of arrogant Knights
of noble class.<PAGE>But these nobles
are a far cry
from the royal class.

## POINTER 3440
Knights are Knights, right?
What do they have to brag about?

## POINTER 3441
*Sigh* I didn't join the Imperial Knights
to slave under a grump
who's all talk and no walk.

## POINTER 3442
Even if I can't make the guards,
I wonder if I can make
the Schwann Brigade...

## POINTER 3443
First I was placed in a 
Brigade not of my choosing,
then the blastia failure...<PAGE>Just my luck.

## POINTER 3444
I'll have to get a spiritual cleansing...

## POINTER 3445
It was so unexpected...
To have a dragon charmer
in our midst?<PAGE>I was in the middle of eating,
so I didn't get to go.

## POINTER 3446
No more.
I don't want to work 
security anymore...

## POINTER 3447
It's been strange lately.
The people of the town 
are disappearing.<PAGE>Nothing like this has happened
since I started working as a Knight...

## POINTER 3448
Is this what daily life is like
on the Tolbyccia continent?<PAGE>I can't take it...
I want to go back to Zaphias...
or at least Torim Harbor...

## POINTER 3449
Welcome. Will you 
be staying? That 
will be 350 Gald.

## POINTER 3450
Have a safe 
journey.

## POINTER 3451
I ran away from
the Cumore Brigade
by the skin of my teeth.<PAGE>I wonder where
those guys are now...

## POINTER 3452
And now, I'm a Knight
of the <STR>(FRE) Brigade!

## POINTER 3453
Welcome, travelers. 
Please take a look 
at our wares.

## POINTER 3454
Thank you very 
much. We await your 
next visit.

## POINTER 3455
Welcome. Are you looking 
for souvenirs? You 
can find them here.

## POINTER 3456
Thank you. Have 
a safe journey.

## POINTER 3457
The coliseum, scene of countless bloody 
battles...it's so thrilling. I want to 
die in that stone circle some day...<PAGE>That's my dream. Wild, isn't 
it? It's a shame the coliseum 
is so far from here...

## POINTER 3458
The leisurely pace 
of Yormgen just 
doesn't suit me.<PAGE>I swear that one day I'll stand in 
the coliseum...and make crimson 
flowers bloom upon its stones...!

## POINTER 3459
Say, have you ever been 
to the coliseum?<PAGE>They say the atmosphere there is like 
a banquet of madness! Is it true?

## POINTER 3460
What? You actually fought in 
the coliseum? I can't believe 
you stepped out in one piece!<PAGE>Looks certainly can be 
deceiving. What kind of 
crime did you commit?

## POINTER 3461
Our village chief is a great man, 
but the sage is even greater.<PAGE>The sage will drive out any 
monster that may attack us.

## POINTER 3462
The sage is considering 
new techniques for expelling 
the monsters.

## POINTER 3463
I hear you people have brought 
us the clear ciel crystal?<PAGE>With the power of the crystal, our village 
will be safe from any monster...

## POINTER 3464
Now our village will be 
eternally safe from 
the monsters' menace.<PAGE>We owe everything to the 
sage. I am so thankful...

## POINTER 3465
That box...I think I've 
seen it before.<PAGE>Hmm...I can't really remember 
where, though.

## POINTER 3466
Look, I told you I don't 
remember where I saw it! 
You sure are pesky.<PAGE>You don't remember what kind of shoes 
people you passed in the street 
yesterday were wearing, do you?

## POINTER 3467
The sage says he's making a doohickey 
from some kind of crystal 
thing! Isn't that amazing?<PAGE>I forgot exactly what he's making. 
I don't really remember, but 
it was definitely amazing.

## POINTER 3468
What's so amazing about it? 
I already told you I don't remember! 
You sure are pesky.<PAGE>Fine. Tell me what's so amazing 
about the ocean, right now. 
You can't, can you?

## POINTER 3469
Welcome, travelers, 
from so far away.<PAGE>I'm afraid our village 
doesn't have anything 
particularly special to offer...

## POINTER 3470
You're the ones who were 
found unconscious, yes?<PAGE>Please make yourself 
at home here.

## POINTER 3471
You're friends 
of the sage?<PAGE>I didn't know. I was wondering 
what you had come to do 
in this tiny rural town.

## POINTER 3472
I'm so sorry we can't prepare 
anything special for you.<PAGE>Oh, yes. Have you seen the 
mountains to the north yet? 
The scenery is very beautiful.

## POINTER 3473
Are you people from 
somewhere else?<PAGE>Isn't it pretty here 
with all the flowers 
blooming?

## POINTER 3474
Everyone from away says 
it's a pretty village.

## POINTER 3475
The desert? "Desert" like 
the places that are all sand? 
You came from a desert?<PAGE>Where is there a desert?

## POINTER 3476
I'm never even seen 
a desert. You must 
have come so far.

## POINTER 3477
You came from across the sea? 
You must be so tired.<PAGE>You've been on a ship for 
a long time, yes? What? No? 
"Blastia"? What's that?

## POINTER 3478
Huh? Apatheia? Is that 
something you eat?

## POINTER 3479
Apparently, if we construct one of 
these "barriers" the monsters will stop 
coming...but is it really safe?<PAGE>I suppose it must be, 
if the sage says it is.

## POINTER 3480
If the sage says it's safe, 
it's definitely safe.<PAGE>It would be simply outrageous 
to doubt the sage!

## POINTER 3481
This town is currently facing 
a terrible crisis...the threat 
of giant monster attack...<PAGE>Everyone says we can accomplish anything 
with the sage on our side, but is 
it all right to believe that...?

## POINTER 3482
This place is so peaceful, 
nobody here really knows 
the value of doubt.<PAGE>I don't want to speak ill 
of the sage, either, but anything 
can happen, right?

## POINTER 3483
Will the monsters really stay away 
from us because of a little pebble 
like the clear ciel crystal?<PAGE>What if they just decide 
to take everything they 
can and kill us all...?

## POINTER 3484
Don't get me wrong. I don't 
want to doubt what the 
sage says, but...<PAGE>Those monsters can speak the human 
tongue...what if they're secretly 
influencing the sage...?

## POINTER 3485
...<PAGE>I don't know you...

## POINTER 3486
I can't talk...
to strangers...

## POINTER 3487
...<PAGE>...*Burp*...

## POINTER 3488
Oh...just 
go away...

## POINTER 3489
If you have a question, 
you should ask the Sage.<PAGE>You can really depend on 
him. Our current mayor is 
too young and unreliable.

## POINTER 3490
For a village chief, it's experience 
that does the talking.<PAGE>The sage's wisdom truly 
speaks volumes about how 
rich his experience is.

## POINTER 3491
Even if our town was perfectly safe 
from monsters, for the chief it 
would still be a temporary fix.<PAGE>Perhaps we should 
just make the sage 
village chief...

## POINTER 3492
Yes, wouldn't making the sage 
our chief be a fine idea?<PAGE>I'll have to suggest it 
to the entire village.

## POINTER 3493
...By the way, how was
Longchi doing?

## POINTER 3494
I always... always
think of him.<PAGE>I want to see him...

## POINTER 3495
Even now, I can see
Longchi smile...<PAGE>I wonder when
he will come home...

## POINTER 3496
So, have you spoken
to the Sage?<PAGE> He is a very nice person,
so he may be willing
to listen.

## POINTER 3497
My father died very suddenly and I 
found myself governing this village, 
but it isn't going well at all...<PAGE>I don't know what I would 
do without the sage's help.

## POINTER 3498
The sage? He lives 
in the largest 
mansion.

## POINTER 3499
The truth is, the villagers' 
faith in me has been wavering 
because of the sage's help...
