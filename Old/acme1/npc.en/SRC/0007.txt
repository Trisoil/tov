## POINTER 700
There are several 
islands with Krityan 
cities inside Krones.<PAGE>But your friends wouldn't 
have gone there.

## POINTER 701
A lot of Krityans just 
take things so easily. <PAGE>I'm not like that, though... 
Oh, it's already 
time to eat.

## POINTER 702
Krityans down on the 
surface are a little different 
from us up here.

## POINTER 703
The monster in the 
air looks delicious. <PAGE>Yeah, I like 
weird foods.

## POINTER 704
Oh... drool... <PAGE>I'd love to just eat that 
monster in the sky raw 
with a little soy sauce...

## POINTER 705
Hey, is it true you humans 
actually use blastia?

## POINTER 706
My grandpa said 
his grandpa told him 
blastia were no good.

## POINTER 707
Noise? I think I might 
have heard something... 
Or not... <PAGE>Sorry, I didn't really 
notice anything. 
I was busy.

## POINTER 708
I'm afraid we can't offer you 
any special hospitality, but 
please make yourself at home.

## POINTER 709
Have you heard about 
the legendary cucumber that 
makes any meal delicious?

## POINTER 710
What was that noise...?

## POINTER 711
I've searched 
throughout the village. 
I can't find her.

## POINTER 712
Where in the world 
did she go?

## POINTER 713
No one's found 
the girl yet. <PAGE>Don't worry. 
She'll come 
back soon.

## POINTER 714
Well, don't be discouraged. 
Rest well.

## POINTER 715
I never imagined the day 
would come when I would see the 
Adephagos with my own eyes...

## POINTER 716
I suppose this is no time 
for talk of legendary cucumbers...

## POINTER 717
We Kritya should be 
able to do something...

## POINTER 718
Perhaps our fate is 
simply to be protected 
by the Entelexeia...

## POINTER 719
This is the elder's home.

## POINTER 720
Please don't carelessly 
touch any of these things.

## POINTER 721
The residence of the elder 
also serves as a meeting 
place for us Krityans.

## POINTER 722
Well... We call them meetings, 
but we start drinking and it 
just ends up as a big party.

## POINTER 723
Welcome. This is all just 
stuff in transport, but 
is there anything you want?

## POINTER 724
Thanks. 
Come back any time.

## POINTER 725
Oh, welcome back. I decided to 
set up shop here instead of sending 
this stuff to the Nor Harbor.

## POINTER 726
We should be safe here, 
right? Welcome. What can 
I help you with today?

## POINTER 727
The world may be in all 
kinds of trouble, but 
I'm still in business.

## POINTER 728
There are probably other 
things to be worried about 
besides business right now...

## POINTER 729
Welcome. There's no turning 
back now... I'm prepared to have 
my bones buried in this Hold.

## POINTER 730
This is Deidon Hold. It's between 
the capital, Zaphias, and the City 
of Blossoms, Halure. <PAGE>Go south to get to the capital
and north to get to Halure.

## POINTER 731
The Hold was built between 
these mountains to block 
the advance of the monsters.<PAGE>Our duty is to fight those 
monsters. We don't have time 
to take care of travelers.

## POINTER 732
This is Deidon Hold. It's between 
the capital, Zaphias, and the City 
of Blossoms, Halure.

## POINTER 733
The Hold is currently 
sealed off. Passage to 
Halure is not permitted.

## POINTER 734
The Hold was built 
between 
these mountains to block 
the advance of the monsters. <PAGE>Our duty as guards is 
to fight those monsters.

## POINTER 735
Go south to get to the capital
and north to get to get to Halure.

## POINTER 736
Hey, haven't I seen you 
somewhere? Maybe it's 
just my imagination.

## POINTER 737
You should stay 
away from Zaphias. <PAGE>We knights are planning 
an operation to arrest the 
rebellious commandant.

## POINTER 738
I'm standing watch because 
I have to guard this area.

## POINTER 739
I'm worried about Zaphias and 
what's happening at sea, but it's 
not like I can leave my post...

## POINTER 740
There were all that weirdness 
going on in Zaphias, and now I hear 
something came up from the sea. <PAGE>I wonder if it's 
okay for me to just 
stand guard here...?

## POINTER 741
I'm worried about all the 
things that are going on, but it's 
not as if I can leave my post...

## POINTER 742
Is it true the Commandant
has passed away?

## POINTER 743
Is it all right just to stay 
here and guard the Hold?

## POINTER 744
I must perform my duty... 
And that duty is to stand 
watch at the Hold.

## POINTER 745
This is the storage for 
the Hold. Fortune's Market
manages the warehouse.<PAGE>It's really messy, 
so I'd prefer it 
if you didn't go in.

## POINTER 746
You can to get to Halure if you get 
past the gate but...do you really want 
to go? You should go back to Zaphias. <PAGE>The monsters are vicious 
this time of year. You 
don't want to die, do you?

## POINTER 747
You can see Halure from 
really far away. Just 
look for the giant tree. <PAGE>I've heard rumors lately 
the tree is dying... 
I wonder if it's all right?

## POINTER 748
Forget about going to 
Halure right now.

## POINTER 749
The Hold cannot be opened 
for passage as long as the Lord 
of the Plains is out there.

## POINTER 750
Have you been to Halure
yet? Their giant tree is 
worth seeing at least once.

## POINTER 751
They say the Tree of Halure's 
flowers are in full bloom. 
I'd love to go see them.

## POINTER 752
Everything's fine as 
long as the Lord of the 
Plains doesn't show up.<PAGE>But this town has to be 
ready for anything, since 
it doesn't have a blastia.

## POINTER 753
The Hold sees a lot of 
travelers while it's open. <PAGE>Lately, there have been a 
lot of tourists going to 
see the Tree of Halure.

## POINTER 754
Captain <STR>(FRE) helped a 
lot of people from 
Zaphias evacuate...

## POINTER 755
We'll fight with our lives 
to support the Knights 
as they take Zaphias.

## POINTER 756
I have a bad feeling 
about this... Will the Hold
be safe without a barrier?

## POINTER 757
It's times like these 
when you really feel 
grateful for the barriers.

## POINTER 758
I hope Zaphias is safe.

## POINTER 759
Why did that thing 
appear in the sky?

## POINTER 760
A monster in the sky? A 
giant tower rising from the 
earth? Is this a dream...?

## POINTER 761
I've had enough of giant 
monsters and towers...

## POINTER 762
Below are lodging 
facilities for travelers 
through the Hold. <PAGE>It's 100 Gald a night. 
Would you like to stay?

## POINTER 763
If you find yourself 
weary, come back any time.<PAGE>Our "facilities" may only 
be tents, but it beats 
camping out on the road.

## POINTER 764
My wife said she wanted 
to come along, but now 
all she does is whine.<PAGE>It's not like I'm having fun 
either. So many monsters... This is 
the last time I go outside a barrier.

## POINTER 765
Our kids are excited to see 
the world, but I gotta protect my 
whole family. It's no picnic.<PAGE>Now I get why most people 
hardly ever leave the barriers.

## POINTER 766
I never imagined we'd 
be held up by the 
Lord of the Plains.

## POINTER 767
Now we're stranded in the middle 
of our trip and my wife's still 
whining. Enough already...

## POINTER 768
Ugh, I'm so tired! I don't want 
to sleep in a tent anymore! 
I want my nice, soft bed!<PAGE>I always said I'd like to get 
out of the city just once. Now 
I see that just once is enough!

## POINTER 769
Let's just go home already. I'm 
gonna get sunburned! My brother 
wants to go, too. Well...probably.<PAGE>Anyone who actually wants to 
travel is just a big wacko, 
as far as I'm concerned.

## POINTER 770
I finally get out of town 
and now we get held 
up? What a bother.

## POINTER 771
We left the city without any 
real plans. That's why we ran 
into the Lord of the Plains.

## POINTER 772
Woo-hoo! A trip! A trip! 
Gonna get on my wagon 
and make my deliveries! <PAGE>Everyone's waiting for this stuff!

## POINTER 773
Going to a new town will be 
so much fun! I wonder how 
many new friends I'll make?<PAGE>I hope I make a hundred friends!

## POINTER 774
Hey, when are we 
gonna get back on 
the wagon and go?

## POINTER 775
Let's hurry up and 
go to town already! I'm 
tired of this place.

## POINTER 776
The lands beyond the barriers may 
be dangerous, but we merchants 
can't really complain about that.<PAGE>Of course, running 
away from monsters all 
day does make you fast.

## POINTER 777
But these holy bottles 
really keep me going.<PAGE>I'm afraid I don't have any to 
spare, but if I get more in, 
you should definitely buy some.

## POINTER 778
I may be used to traveling 
alone, but even I run away 
from the Lord of the Plains.

## POINTER 779
The Lord of the Plains is scary and 
all, but the way they all charge 
in packs.... The whole earth shakes!

## POINTER 780
Huh? You shouldn't 
be up here!<PAGE>As you can probably tell, 
you can't see this place 
from below. It's the best!

## POINTER 781
What's so great about it, you 
ask? Isn't it obvious? No one 
can see me when I...you know...<PAGE>Maybe you'll find out 
later. Hee hee hee!

## POINTER 782
Hey now, this is my own 
private VIP seat. Hurry 
up and climb back down!

## POINTER 783
*Sigh*...being able to see 
the Lord of the Plains from here... 
It's just...amazing...

## POINTER 784
I wish it would hurry up 
and become the season for the 
Lord of the Plains again...

## POINTER 785
Ah, look at the low folk 
toiling away, crawling about 
in the muck again today.

## POINTER 786
There's a fight on 
to capture Zaphias. <PAGE>They can count me out of 
that operation. No thanks.

## POINTER 787
L-look, this is my post. 
I can't just leave it. <PAGE>That should 
be okay...right?

## POINTER 788
Lots of people seem to be 
fleeing Zaphias, but nobody's 
going there. Are we safe here?

## POINTER 789
I wonder if we're safe here?

## POINTER 790
I don't care what's 
happening in the sky. I'm 
not leaving my post!

## POINTER 791
It's probably because we're up so 
high, but that sky sure is spooky. 
Pretty scary, if you ask me...

## POINTER 792
Doesn't it look like that 
thing could just reach 
out and grab you? Eek!

## POINTER 793
I'm about to head 
for Halure.<PAGE>It's rich in medicinal 
herbs and such.

## POINTER 794
Ahh, Halure!∀ Nobody in Zaphias
could imagine a town in such 
perfect harmony with nature. <PAGE>I love my job!∀

## POINTER 795
There's no way we're 
getting to Halure with the Lord 
of the Plains out there.

## POINTER 796
The Halure flowers are good 
for making medicines, so I'd 
like to go gather some, but...

## POINTER 797
Well, then...
I've had my rest, 
it's time to set off.<PAGE>Of course, it's not like I can 
go alone. I have to wait for 
everyone else to get ready.

## POINTER 798
We merchants delivering 
goods travel as a group.<PAGE>Why? The monsters. They won't 
attack with this many wagons. It's 
crazy to travel in small groups.

## POINTER 799
No matter how well you prepare, 
nothing can help you if you run 
into the Lord of the Plains.
