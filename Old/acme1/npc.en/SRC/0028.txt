## POINTER 2800
The coliseum is a cornucopia 
of thrills and excitement.<PAGE>But, for some reason...it's 
just not enough anymore.

## POINTER 2801
The matches in the coliseum just 
don't satisfy me anymore.<PAGE>Why? What does 
it mean?

## POINTER 2802
I'm completely addicted 
to the coliseum's 
charms.<PAGE>That's why I made up my mind to 
live here permanently. Now I just 
have to save up some Gald...

## POINTER 2803
I left a husband behind, but 
it doesn't really bother me.<PAGE>The coliseum is more important 
than a husband.

## POINTER 2804
My. oh my...
Why do they fight 
here of all places?<PAGE>If you want to fight, 
get to the coliseum!

## POINTER 2805
If they want to fight, 
they should try beating 
someone in the coliseum.<PAGE>Honestly, these bloody-minded 
men are really a pain!

## POINTER 2806
A bearded man 
with a pale face ran 
away from here.<PAGE>There was a dog chasing him... 
No, it was more like a monster... 
Is there a monster inside the barrier...?

## POINTER 2807
The guy running away, 
and even the dog, 
both looked terrible!

## POINTER 2808
I'm originally 
from Zaphias, but 
I moved here.<PAGE>The seaside view and the smell of the 
sea are wonderful, but most importantly 
this is where the coliseum is.

## POINTER 2809
I may have left my husband behind in Zaphias, 
but he always had more time for his hobbies 
than he did me. Now we're even.

## POINTER 2810
I left my husband in Zaphias to 
be near the coliseum, but sometimes 
I get a little worried...<PAGE>Is he eating right? Is he 
cleaning up after himself?

## POINTER 2811
Of course, I forget all 
about my husband when 
the matches begin.

## POINTER 2812
Just look at this town. Full 
of warships and knights.<PAGE>I thought this place was so 
unlike Zaphias, but now it isn't 
very different at all.

## POINTER 2813
Even so, it's worth 
it as long as the coliseum 
keeps running.

## POINTER 2814
I was just another immigrant when I first 
moved here, but now I've really gotten used 
to the place and made a lot of friends.<PAGE>...Just a little joke. No, 
all I care about are the 
matches in the coliseum.

## POINTER 2815
All my cares are washed 
away when the matches 
begin...

## POINTER 2816
What's wrong with the sky? That 
must be over in Ilyccia.<PAGE>Is Zaphias safe? 
My husband...

## POINTER 2817
I'm not exactly sure why, but I'm worried 
about my husband in Zaphias...

## POINTER 2818
I've decided to return to Zaphias 
for a little while, and bring 
my husband back here with me.<PAGE>It's much better 
living in Nordopolica 
now, anyway.

## POINTER 2819
I love watching the matches alone, 
but maybe they'll be even more exciting 
with my husband beside me.

## POINTER 2820
These are the docks. If you 
wish to travel by sea, you 
may depart from here.

## POINTER 2821
If you own your own ship, you can 
come and go whenever you like.♪

## POINTER 2822
These are the docks. Passage 
on sea routes is currently 
under regulation.

## POINTER 2823
I wouldn't recommend setting 
sail right now.

## POINTER 2824
Don't talk to me...

## POINTER 2825
Look, you can't just 
come in here...

## POINTER 2826
...
Ho, boy. Would you 
listen to the ramblings 
of an old woman?<PAGE>Nobody believes me, but 
I saw it...I saw it clearly 
with my own two eyes.

## POINTER 2827
What did I see, you ask? 
A monster. A monster!<PAGE>I mistakenly stepped into the pathway, 
and saw the very moment it changed shape 
from human to beast...*shiver*...

## POINTER 2828
Did the coliseum 
monster escape...?<PAGE>It’s gone?! 
The monster that looks 
like a big fox...

## POINTER 2829
I’ve seen that monster before... 
Man, if that thing goes off on one, 
it’s gonna get real serious real quick.

## POINTER 2830
That monster I saw awhile ago at the back 
of the coliseum...what could it have been?<PAGE>It was certainly fearsome, but there 
was something almost celestial about 
it that gave me goosebumps...

## POINTER 2831
Perhaps it was a guardian 
deity that protects 
our city...?

## POINTER 2832
There's something disquieting 
in the air recently...<PAGE>I suppose you'd call it sixth sense. 
I just have a feeling something 
awful is going to happen...

## POINTER 2833
O guardian deity, please 
protect your city 
and its citizens...

## POINTER 2834
Our guardian deity...the 
monster...it was killed.<PAGE>Guildsmen from the 
Union did it. What 
barbarians...

## POINTER 2835
If that really was 
our guardian, this 
city is finished.

## POINTER 2836
They say it was the 
guardian deity that 
killed Duce Belius. <PAGE>I suppose it wasn't our 
guardian at all...just 
a common monster.

## POINTER 2837
How pitiful to be without a guardian 
deity, without Duce Belius...and 
protected by the Knights.

## POINTER 2838
Lord Natz is 
working hard as 
interim Duce.<PAGE>Unlike Duce Belius, we're 
able to see him frequently...one 
feels very close to him.

## POINTER 2839
It's true he doesn't have the charisma 
Duce Belius had, even though she 
always kept herself hidden away.

## POINTER 2840
Lord Natz is doing his very 
best to protect this city.<PAGE>Now all the citizens have to make a 
concerted effort to unite behind him.

## POINTER 2841
I don't care what's happening in 
any of the other cities. If Nordopolica 
is peaceful, I'm happy.

## POINTER 2842
You lot came to fight, didn't 
you? I can tell by your eyes. 
What a bunch of eager beavers!<PAGE>How I love to see people 
like you get the stuffing 
kicked out of them.

## POINTER 2843
Hey, no offense. This may 
be a spectator arena, but 
the monsters are monsters.<PAGE>It's not unusual for some pretty 
tough customers to leave the 
coliseum bruised and broken.

## POINTER 2844
Hey you, what are you 
doing wandering about?<PAGE>Aer krene? Phaeroh? 
What are you 
talking about?

## POINTER 2845
What are you doing 
here just wandering around?<PAGE>There’s no great information 
in this town, 
we’re out in the sticks you know!

## POINTER 2846
A bearded old man ran 
out of the coliseum 
and out of town.<PAGE>There are many like him that just 
run away after losing a tournament.

## POINTER 2847
The old man that ran away 
was different to the normal 
sorts you get at the coliseum...<PAGE>Well, I guess there 
are some like him 
there...sometimes.

## POINTER 2848
You're travelers, right? I'll 
tell it to you straight. There's 
nothing on this continent.<PAGE>There's a road, but it's a dead end. The 
caves are all full of monsters, and beyond 
them is desert and desolate mountains.

## POINTER 2849
There's a town out there 
they call an oasis, but it's 
just another sand pit.<PAGE>Look, I won't say any more. 
You best get back on your ship 
and go home to mama, huh?

## POINTER 2850
Oh, man...what do they think 
they're doing, just letting 
the Knights in like that?<PAGE>A lot of people here 
hate the Empire. There 
might be trouble.

## POINTER 2851
Not that I'd mind. Maybe 
we'll have us a little 
bit of sightseeing.

## POINTER 2852
What? Belius is dead? Now things 
are really getting interesting.<PAGE>The only reason this town lasted 
is because Belius was around.

## POINTER 2853
Seems like more Knights are coming in 
to Nordopolica every day. I wonder what 
Palestralle's going to do about it?<PAGE>Heh-heh...This is going 
to be fun. A real show!

## POINTER 2854
How boring...the Knights are 
actually pretty well-behaved.<PAGE>You might even say it's thanks to them 
things have quieted down around here.

## POINTER 2855
Hmph. I'm surprised at how spineless 
the people here really are.<PAGE>Not to mention, Belius turned out to 
be a lot less popular than I thought.

## POINTER 2856
Ha ha ha ha! What the hell's that 
thing in the sky? Some kind of monster? 
Looking good, looking good!<PAGE>What's this then, the end of the 
world? Ha ha ha! Bring it on!

## POINTER 2857
I don't care. I don't care if this 
town, this continent, the entire 
world goes up in flames. Hmph.

## POINTER 2858
Now it's Ilyccia 
in a panic!<PAGE>The seas and the skies going mad! 
How festive! It's a party, a 
big old party! Ha ha ha ha!

## POINTER 2859
...I don't know. Now I'm feeling empty. 
What the hell am I carrying on about?<PAGE>If I don't act like this...if I 
start to see what's really going 
on...it'll be so frightening...

## POINTER 2860
I came to Desier to search 
for the origin of we 
Kritya in the west.<PAGE>But the mountain path has 
collapsed, and I've had 
to forsake that goal...

## POINTER 2861
If only I could get beyond the mountain 
path...the land beyond is flat and 
would be comparatively easy going.<PAGE>At least, that's how it 
looks on the maps.

## POINTER 2862
It seems I have much more hard 
travel to endure if I'm to discover 
the origin of the Kritya.<PAGE>Even if I somehow get through the 
mountains, they say the lands beyond 
are vast and brutal desert.

## POINTER 2863
The only people I can imagine going 
out into that desert would be pioneers, 
thrillseekers, or madmen.

## POINTER 2864
I'm considering postponing my quest 
for the origins of the Kritya 
and staying here for a while.<PAGE>Belius, the Duce of Nordopolica, 
has expressed a desire 
in meeting me.

## POINTER 2865
If things go well, 
she may offer me 
employment...

## POINTER 2866
I can't believe Duce Belius 
is dead...we were supposed to meet 
and have all manner of discussions.<PAGE>What an unfortunate twist of fate. 
It was such a promising chance...

## POINTER 2867
This must be a message from the 
heavens: "Go and discover the 
origin of the Kritya"...

## POINTER 2868
I've had Lord Natz arrange 
for me to work at the 
coliseum's library.<PAGE>It's quite befitting a city of such history. 
There are enough books there to satisfy 
any Kritya's thirst for knowledge.

## POINTER 2869
I may even be able to discover 
our origins without ever having 
to go beyond those mountains.

## POINTER 2870
I once saw an image that looked 
very much like that ominous 
shadow in the sky.<PAGE>It must have been in one of 
the books in my parents' room, 
when I was very young...

## POINTER 2871
I get the feeling we Kritya somehow 
have a very deep connection 
to that beast in the sky...

## POINTER 2872
Long ago, the clans of old and the human 
ruling class stood in partnership, 
united through Kritya mediation.<PAGE>This may finally be 
our time to stand up.

## POINTER 2873
Yes, I remember now. It 
was in a passage in one 
of my parents' books.<PAGE>Be it lies or truth, I 
believe this is a duty 
assigned to our people.

## POINTER 2874
*Huff*...*huff*...*huff*...<PAGE>What...*pant*...am 
I...*pant*...doing?

## POINTER 2875
Whew...I'm thinking about 
taking part in a tournament, 
that's what.<PAGE>I'm in training, you see. 
Got to build stamina.

## POINTER 2876
*Huff*...*huff*...*huff*...*huff*...
*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...
I'm starting to get bored with...<PAGE>*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...
...Swinging this sword...

## POINTER 2877
Whew...Maybe go for a jog 
outside town? No...the monsters 
are too dangerous...

## POINTER 2878
*Huff*...*huff*...*huff*...*huff*...
*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...
The Knights are such a pain...<PAGE>*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...
...I wish they wouldn't...look at me...
...It's so...embarrassing...

## POINTER 2879
...What do we even need 
with the Knights when 
we're around...?

## POINTER 2880
*Huff*...*huff*... I'm doing my 
best to build up stamina 
here, and Belius up and dies?<PAGE>If they stop the tournaments...
*Pant*...*pant*...*pant*...
This will all have been...for nothing...

## POINTER 2881
Whew...Cados is closed, sea 
routes are closed, and the mountain 
path is impassable.<PAGE>Nordopolica's completely 
independent now...

## POINTER 2882
Don! Don! Doooooon!! Aaaaaah...!! 
The Don...how could the 
Don have died...?!<PAGE>This shock...how am I supposed...to 
express it?!

## POINTER 2883
If only I had been in Dahngrest! 
Don! Doooon! I wouldn't 
have let you die!<PAGE>Don! Don! Doooooon!!

## POINTER 2884
*Huff*...*huff*... This is no 
time...to mourn... *Pant*...*pant*... 
...the Don's death...<PAGE>*Huff*...*huff*... Now I have 
to train... *Pant*...*pant*... 
...to kill that monster...!

## POINTER 2885
Whew...I wonder how much training 
I'll have to do to be able 
to kill that thing...?

## POINTER 2886
*Huff* *huff*... I'll keep swinging 
this sword... *Pant*...*pant*... 
for tomorrow...!

## POINTER 2887
Whew...the road to victory 
is a long, rugged, and vicious
one...

## POINTER 2888
This city is governed by the Guild 
known as Palestralle, and their 
chief is a woman named Belius.<PAGE>Here in the city, they 
call her the "Duce" 
out of respect.

## POINTER 2889
This world may be a wide one, 
but the only Guild governing an 
entire city is Palestralle.<PAGE>Dahngrest is different...in 
actuality, it's ruled by 
the Don and his Union.

## POINTER 2890
Nordopolica exists 
completely independent 
from the Empire.<PAGE>So even if a riot breaks out, 
the Knight's are not 
allowed to intervene.

## POINTER 2891
If the knights did intervene, 
this would be a big deal!

## POINTER 2892
The coliseum is divided into three areas: 
The market district, the residential 
district, and the coliseum itself.<PAGE>Outsiders are strictly forbidden from 
entering the residential district in 
the interest of keeping the peace.

## POINTER 2893
I'm told you can enter the residential 
district if you become a citizen.<PAGE>I can't imagine there'd 
be much of interest 
there, though.

## POINTER 2894
The monsters in the coliseum are 
supposed to get much fiercer 
when the new moon approaches.<PAGE>That's why they post especially tough 
members of Palestralle to keep watch 
on the night of the new moon.

## POINTER 2895
I just happened to be inside the 
coliseum when the reverse barrier 
holding in the monsters failed.<PAGE>It was very frightening, but I'm glad 
it happened during the full moon, when 
the monsters are relatively docile.

## POINTER 2896
The coliseum city is 
completely independent 
from the Empire.<PAGE>That's partly thanks to it being located 
so far from Ilyccia, where Zaphias is.

## POINTER 2897
I'm sure letting Knights in 
like this goes against the citizenry's 
better judgment.

## POINTER 2898
They say the person who was actually 
in charge of managing Palestralle 
was the interim Duce, Natz.<PAGE>Belius's death doesn't seem to 
have been attributed to any failing 
of his management, either.

## POINTER 2899
With that said, the loss of a 
spiritual leader like Belius 
is a great one for this city.
