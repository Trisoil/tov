Let's shuffle up and 
deal! This here's 
the poker table.

## POINTER 4801
Thank you very much. Please 
come see us again.

## POINTER 4802
Welcome to the Official 
Imperial Testing Center.<PAGE>We have the full range of tests 
available for you to take.

## POINTER 4803
You will have to take the 
tests standing up, so you 
may find it a bit taxing.<PAGE>There's no denying the importance 
of testing one's intelligence, will 
power, and physical strength.

## POINTER 4804
Capsule, capsule! Toy, toy! 
You say capsule, I'll 
say toy! Capsule! Toy!<PAGE>Welcome to capsule toy 
square. Let's hear those 
capsules rattle!

## POINTER 4805
Going in order from the right, 
the machines cost 1, 10, 100, 
and 500 chips per play.<PAGE>The more a machine costs, the better 
the prizes you can win. No risk, 
no reward, I always say.∀

## POINTER 4806
The charm! The allure! 
Welcome to the 
game center.<PAGE>Here you'll find only the state 
of the art in arcade gaming, 
all for your enjoyment!

## POINTER 4807
The buttons and levers are 
all you'll need to play.<PAGE>Put your body into it 
now, don't be shy!

## POINTER 4808
Step right up, and have 
yourself a look!<PAGE>Take a look at this model!

## POINTER 4809
Squint your eyes and take a peep! 
It'll come to you, you'll get it.<PAGE>Have a look anytime you like!

## POINTER 4810
Oh yeah, oh yeah! 
Step right up!<PAGE>Here now, look at what 
we've got here!

## POINTER 4811
Yup yup. You look like you've 
got the time, so come on 
by whenever you like.

## POINTER 4812
(PC Monologue) The soldier's just 
standing there watching 
the shopkeeper...

## POINTER 4813
(PC Monologue) He's not moving at all... 
Maybe he's asleep?

## POINTER 4814
(PC Monologue) This guy's not 
moving at all.  
Just like always...

## POINTER 4815
(PC Monologue) Wait a minute. 
Maybe there's nobody 
even inside that armor...?

## POINTER 4816
It's so hot...<PAGE>It's already night and 
you could still fry an egg 
on my armor and helmet...

## POINTER 4817
It wasn't necessary 
to speak to the kids 
so harshly...<PAGE>I wonder if they think 
the same of me as they 
do those Knights.

## POINTER 4818
This assignment is such 
a nightmare, I muddied the <PAGE>fountain the other day.
Nah, I'm just kidding. <PAGE>Just a fun little lie <PAGE>to pass the time...

## POINTER 4819
This just isn't right!

## POINTER 4820
Ohh... 
There were still so many 
things I wanted to do...

## POINTER 4821
Keep off the streets at night. 
You'll only be in the way.<PAGE>Huh? I seem different than the 
daytime soldiers? What, are you 
stupid? We work on shifts!

## POINTER 4822
If we're clear on that, 
get back to the inn and 
get some sleep.<PAGE>Then in the morning, 
take a hike out of town.

## POINTER 4823
You guys again, huh? 
You shouldn't be wandering around 
outside without good reason.

## POINTER 4824
I could haul you in 
as suspicious people, you know.<PAGE>If we're clear on that, 
then get back to the 
inn and get some sleep.

## POINTER 4825
It's so nice and cool at night! 
And I'm gonna make sure it 
stays peaceful at night too!

## POINTER 4826
Hey, we're not supposed 
to walk around at night. 
Keep this a secret.<PAGE>The best time for going out's 
actually at night. It's so dark 
you can hide almost anywhere.

## POINTER 4827
If I had some black clothes 
nobody could see me...<PAGE>Hey, wait. 
Your clothes are 
all black.

## POINTER 4828
What?! Cumore
ran away?<PAGE>I was hoping I'd get 
to pound him good.

## POINTER 4829
Whoa... 
You can see me? I was 
even holding my breath.<PAGE>You've got pretty good eyes.

## POINTER 4830
I wonder what the Knights 
would do if they found me. 
Talk about exciting...

## POINTER 4831
Mom and Dad came 
back, so I'm not scared 
at night anymore!

## POINTER 4832
But it's still not fair how 
they're always telling me 
it's past my bedtime...

## POINTER 4833
The Knights are watching 
over us too, so I'm 
not scared at all!

## POINTER 4834
Even if a spooky 
bogeyman came for me, 
the Knights'd get him.

## POINTER 4835
That monster... 
There in the sky... 
I-it's scary.

## POINTER 4836
But it's also...kinda... 
pretty in a way...

## POINTER 4837
Please come again.

## POINTER 4838
...You're really annoying.

## POINTER 4839
Sorry, but we're closed at night. Actually, 
we're taking a break now, so coming 
during the day's no good, either.

## POINTER 4840
I'm sorry, but we aren't taking 
tickets at this time.

## POINTER 4841
What am I doing here at this 
time of night, you ask?<PAGE>I don't know, I feel 
like I can't really relax 
unless I'm here.

## POINTER 4842
Wait, does that 
make me a 
workaholic?

## POINTER 4843
No boats are allowed to launch 
after dark. Our apologies.

## POINTER 4844
Of course, that doesn't mean 
we can always take the boats 
out during the day, either.

## POINTER 4845
Always busy, day or night, it's 
the Trino Ferry at your service.♪<PAGE>I've been doing so much paperwork for 
all the evacuees from the capital, 
I haven't been getting any sleep.

## POINTER 4846
My goodness, I might just 
pass out from overwork.

## POINTER 4847
No boats running at night. 
No boats running during the 
day, either. Our apologies!

## POINTER 4848
That busy period we went through, 
seems like a bad dream now...

## POINTER 4849
They told me they can't pay 
me to be here at night, and 
that I should just go home.<PAGE>I'm um, here anyway, though.

## POINTER 4850
It's my mission in life right now 
just to sit here in this very spot.

## POINTER 4851
That has nothing to do with the sea
because that happened on the mountain!
But that's something I can't say.

## POINTER 4852
Here at Trino Transport we're 
busy both day and night!<PAGE>We're accepting cargo for 
shipping at all hours!

## POINTER 4853
The future's in transportation, you know! That's why 
we've gotta fight the good fight around the clock!

## POINTER 4854
Welcome! We're proud to provide service 
with a smile, even at night!

## POINTER 4855
Come again, now!

## POINTER 4856
Zzz... Whoa, looks 
like I nodded off.

## POINTER 4857
Zzz... 
...Who me? 
I'm not sleepin'.

## POINTER 4858
Zzz... Th-the 
stone...!<PAGE>Huh, guess it was a dream.

## POINTER 4859
Zzz... Grandma, 
my stone...<PAGE>*Mumble, mumble...* Hah!

## POINTER 4860
Zzz... Which one's more 
important? You or my stone? 
Well now, grandma...<PAGE>...Hah!

## POINTER 4861
Zzz... Well, ya see 
now mother, that 
stone is, it's...<PAGE>Hah!

## POINTER 4862
Zzz... Whoa, I conked 
out, there...<PAGE>That stone's become the only 
thing I dream about lately.

## POINTER 4863
Zzz... Come on now, stone, 
I'm so sleepy...<PAGE>...Huh...? Guess 
I nodded off.

## POINTER 4864
Zzz... 
...Huh...?<PAGE>You'd better have some news about my 
stone if you've gone and woke me up, 
or I'm gonna be real angry, ya hear?

## POINTER 4865
Zzz... 
...Huh...? 
What?<PAGE>Again, huh?

## POINTER 4866
Zzz... 
Huh...?<PAGE>About the only thing I'm gonna listen to at this 
late hour, is some tasty tidbits about my stone.

## POINTER 4867
Zzz... 
Huh...?<PAGE>If you're wakin' me up this late at night, does that 
mean you've got some news about my precious stone?

## POINTER 4868
The magistrate's takes his own 
cut of the taxes, so I'm not 
selling anything right now.<PAGE>Sorry to get your hopes up.

## POINTER 4869
I lucked out on this sweet spot, though, 
so I've gotta hold onto it...

## POINTER 4870
Now that Ragou's gone, a new 
magistrate's on their way.<PAGE>Here's hoping that means the 
taxes'll be lowered a bit...

## POINTER 4871
Just you wait a few months, 
and my shop'll have the hottest 
goods in town...I hope.

## POINTER 4872
The new magistrate's arrived, but 
the taxes haven't come down yet...<PAGE>I guess it's no easy thing for a low-level 
bureaucrat to cut taxes once they've 
been inflated, though.

## POINTER 4873
Man, just when am I gonna be able to get 
this business back on its feet again...?

## POINTER 4874
There's some real panic breaking out around 
the capital... And now the Tolbyccian continent's 
gone nuts over the death of the Don.<PAGE>There's no telling when I'll be able 
to get business going again...

## POINTER 4875
Just how am I supposed to 
scrape out a living, come 
tomorrow, I ask ya...?

## POINTER 4876
My savings is draining away one day at 
a time, just paying for this spot...<PAGE>So what am I still doing here? This is 
the best spot in the lot, and I'll be 
damned if I'm just gonna let it go.

## POINTER 4877
I know that's sorta like putting 
the cart before the horse, but 
I can't let myself quit.

## POINTER 4878
If you ask me, there's been more misfortune 
lately than when Ragou was running things.<PAGE>Maybe I'm in the wrong for being 
so attached to this place.

## POINTER 4879
Wonder if my luck'll change 
if I move to another town 
and open a shop there.

## POINTER 4880
I've made up my mind! If this store's 
going down, I'm going down with it!<PAGE>Let 'em call me crazy if they want to. 
I'm gonna do my business right here.

## POINTER 4881
If I survive, and I manage to start 
getting items in on a regular basis, 
come back and see me some time.<PAGE>I'll be waiting for ya.

## POINTER 4882
Oooh. If the port's shut down, we're 
going to run out of stock!<PAGE>There's no way we can compete with Fortune's 
Market if we're forced to sell only 
what we can find on Ilyccia.

## POINTER 4883
The place across the street 
seems to be doing all right... 
Ooh! That just burns me!

## POINTER 4884
The harbor's been opened again, but no boats 
have arrived yet. When will they get here?<PAGE>Come on, get here already!

## POINTER 4885
It's like I can feel our business 
losing customers by the minute... 
I mean, give us a break already!

## POINTER 4886
The trade routes still aren't 
back to normal, yet.<PAGE>Oooh! I swear, Fortune's Market is 
trying to establish a monopoly!

## POINTER 4887
I wonder if Fortune's Market wouldn't 
let us join up with them...

## POINTER 4888
Fortune's Market has 
their own exclusive 
supply routes!<PAGE>Like through the glacial plains in the 
north part of the continent, for example. 
How can we compete with that?

## POINTER 4889
Transporting cargo across 
thin sheets of ice is one 
risky proposition, right?

## POINTER 4890
The port is clogged with battleships, and some 
weird building's popped up out in the ocean.<PAGE>So how is Fortune's Market 
getting all their 
merchandise, huh?

## POINTER 4891
Business is booming for the place across 
the way, even at times like this...<PAGE>Hmm, joining Fortune's Market doesn't 
seem so bad now, after all...

## POINTER 4892
With the world as unstable as 
it is, I decided to cut my losses 
and join  Fortune's Market.<PAGE>And now I get hit with all sorts of 
entry fees and member's dues! Do 
they think money grows on trees?!

## POINTER 4893
Wherever you go, it's the 
locals in a given area that 
have to stick together...

## POINTER 4894
We've had earthquakes, and the mountain to the north collapsed. 
Honestly, there's times I've almost packed up and left.<PAGE>But leaving the place I was raised 
in...much less venturing outside 
the barrier, is just...you know?

## POINTER 4895
The people in the shop next 
door haven't given up, so I've 
got to stay strong myself.

## POINTER 4896
Zzz... 
...Huh?<PAGE>I've gone and fallen asleep right 
when the world's in a pinch...

## POINTER 4897
Zzz... 
...Huh?<PAGE>Dag nabbit, I fell 
asleep again.

## POINTER 4898
Well, now. Travelers, are you? This is something you 
don't see everyday. No one but me here at Nor inn, 
I'm afraid. Do come and stay a bit, if you like.

## POINTER 4899
It's gotten quite late, hasn't 
it? Why not turn in for 
the night at our inn?
