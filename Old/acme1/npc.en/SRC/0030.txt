## POINTER 3000
We were relieved because 
we thought the monster was 
away to Ilyccia...<PAGE>But then we were attacked by
something weird. Disasters occur
when you least expect them!

## POINTER 3001
Well, we're O.K. because 
we’re inside the barrier...
But...weren’t they eating the barrier?

## POINTER 3002
What? First that spooky thing in the sky, and 
now a giant tower appears out of nowhere?<PAGE>What the hell's going on? 
Is our world falling apart?

## POINTER 3003
My head's like a mad woman's breakfast! 
I can't make sense of anything!

## POINTER 3004
This is the one and only coliseum 
in the entire world. People come 
from far and wide just to see it.<PAGE>You folk aren't from around here either, 
are you? Anyone could tell looking 
at your mismatched outfits.

## POINTER 3005
The coliseum is massive enough to not 
only hold a crowd of spectators, but an 
entire residential district as well.<PAGE>As you can see, we have a market, 
an inn...the coliseum is really one
giant city.

## POINTER 3006
On the way to the Sands of Kogorh,
 there is a shortcut through 
the Cados mountain range.<PAGE>But it's just sand. 
What on earth do you 
want to go there for?

## POINTER 3007
That reminds me, the Cados mountain
pass was closed off by fallen rocks
some years ago. I think...

## POINTER 3008
The coliseum is massive enough to not 
only hold a crowd of spectators, but an 
entire residential district as well.<PAGE>As you can see, we have a market, 
an inn...the coliseum is 
really one giant city.

## POINTER 3009
Why are there Knights 
in this town?<PAGE>If we leave it as it is, the discipline 
we worked hard to build in 
the coliseum will collapse!

## POINTER 3010
We protect this 
town ourselves, 
no matter what!<PAGE>We’ve managed 
alright so far without 
the Empire’s help.

## POINTER 3011
This city is built upon the idea 
of its citizens having equal 
status with Palestralle.<PAGE>We don't submit to absolute 
rule of the Empire's 
kind here.

## POINTER 3012
That fact is the pride of every man, 
woman and child in Nordopolica.<PAGE>Of course, outsiders seem to have 
a hard time understanding it.

## POINTER 3013
I'm astounded they let Imperial Knights in. Not 
to worry, though...Palestralle and the warriors 
from the coliseum are all tough cookies.<PAGE>They'll have the Knights 
thrown out in no time.

## POINTER 3014
Duce Belius would never 
permit Imperial Knights entry 
in the first place...

## POINTER 3015
What in the world is going 
on? Duce Belius is 
dead? It can't be true!<PAGE>What's going to happen 
to this city if Duce 
Belius dies?

## POINTER 3016
This city will be finished 
without Duce Belius...!

## POINTER 3017
The Knights, those sneaky bastards. They 
think they can take over this town 
by smartly pretending to defend it?<PAGE>If only Duce Belius were still alive...she 
never would have permitted such tyranny...

## POINTER 3018
But she's gone...Duce 
Belius is gone...

## POINTER 3019
This is all the Knights' fault! 
They're the reason that horrible 
thing is in the sky.<PAGE>It's true, isn't it? I know it is!

## POINTER 3020
This is all the Knights' fault! It's their 
fault ships are wrecked at sea. And it's 
their fault there are storms in port!

## POINTER 3021
This is all the Knights' 
fault! They're the reason 
that tower appeared.<PAGE>It's true, isn't it? I know it is!

## POINTER 3022
This is all the Knights' fault! It's their 
fault Duce Belius died. And it's 
their fault that tomatoes are red!

## POINTER 3023
I'm a member of Palestralle, the 
guild that governs this city.<PAGE>I'm on patrol today, 
as usual.

## POINTER 3024
You start any needless trouble, 
I'll be there to slap you 
with a sanction in a flash!

## POINTER 3025
What’s that? 
Some Knights are heading 
to the coliseum?<PAGE>They must have 
been in hiding here 
all along!

## POINTER 3026
What’s going on? 
What are the Knights doing there...!?

## POINTER 3027
The tournament champion was 
a captain in the Knights?<PAGE>We never would have let 
the Knights in if we'd 
found out sooner.

## POINTER 3028
We've always made quick 
work of any monster, because 
we work as a team.

## POINTER 3029
I got a report that the Knights 
have closed down Cados.<PAGE>Sounds like there's some big stink 
happening up top. Who the hell 
do the Knights think they are?

## POINTER 3030
We may have had a bit of trouble 
here lately, but now they're 
way out of bounds.<PAGE>I want to raise some serious protest, 
but it's out of my league...

## POINTER 3031
The Union's really 
done it now...<PAGE>I always knew the Don 
was after the Duce's 
good stuff!

## POINTER 3032
The only faction that can stand 
toe-to-toe with the Union and 
the Empire is Palestralle.<PAGE>The Don in the north and Belius to the 
south...they weren't playing around.

## POINTER 3033
The interim Duce's doing a pretty good 
job of keeping Palestralle together.<PAGE>Our only problem now is the 
Knights making such a nuisance 
of themselves in town...

## POINTER 3034
The whole deal with the Union was just 
a misunderstanding. Why do we still 
have to have the Knights watch us?

## POINTER 3035
That's some weird stuff going 
on in the sky, there.<PAGE>What do you suppose it is? Some 
nasty work of the Empire's?

## POINTER 3036
Nah...no human hand could have 
brought that thing to life...

## POINTER 3037
A small monster again? 
The Empire did it...?<PAGE>No, that can’t 
be right...

## POINTER 3038
Is that monster 
some how connected to 
the one in the sky?<PAGE>It’s nasty looking!!

## POINTER 3039
Even if the whole rest of the world goes 
to hell, Nordopolica will be safe.<PAGE>It's only the Empire that's 
going down. Palestralle will 
defend this city to the end!

## POINTER 3040
Palestralle has been united as one 
since its inception, and now we're 
united under interim Duce Natz!

## POINTER 3041
I get to live in this 
town, you know.<PAGE>Not bad, huh? Pretty nice, huh?
You jealous?

## POINTER 3042
I'm gonna get big and strong 
like Kratos and be a coliseum 
hero myself some day.<PAGE>You guys wouldn't even have a 
chance against him. He's the 
strongest man in the world.

## POINTER 3043
What? What? 
The champion won again!?<PAGE>That was the huge roar 
I heard from the coliseum!?

## POINTER 3044
I heard the roar too...<PAGE>Everyone so excited they 
have to scream! 
It’s great!

## POINTER 3045
Incredible! Amazing! 
The new coliseum champion 
is so grand!<PAGE>What's his name? <STR>(FRE)? He's 
a knight captain, right? Wow! 
The Knights are so grand!

## POINTER 3046
Could I get that strong 
if I became a knight? 
Could I beat anybody?

## POINTER 3047
Wow, the knights are so amazing! They 
even beat all the coliseum monsters.<PAGE>Those horns are 
so grand!♪

## POINTER 3048
Only the really grand ones 
get horns, it looks like.

## POINTER 3049
Hey, are the Knights bad 
guys, or what? That's what 
all the grownups say.<PAGE>How could they be bad guys and be 
so grand at the same time...?

## POINTER 3050
Hmm. Maybe bad guys 
can be grand, too.

## POINTER 3051
The town's pretty much back to 
normal thanks to the Knights!<PAGE>Ooh, they're so grand. Whoops...better 
not say that too loud...my mom will 
give me a licking if she hears...

## POINTER 3052
Nobody likes the Knights. 
I guess they are bad 
guys after all.

## POINTER 3053
I've given up on being a hero in the coliseum. 
I'm gonna be a hero with the Knights!<PAGE>That sounds like it'll be a lot more 
fun. I just hope my mom lets me.

## POINTER 3054
I'll have to save up a lot of 
money to get to Zaphias...<PAGE>Oh, wait... 
First I have 
to grow up...

## POINTER 3055
I knew it! 
Palestralle are so cool!<PAGE>They can stand up to a monster
like that without flinching!

## POINTER 3056
Palestralle and the Knights are both cool...
both nice...<PAGE>I wonder who's 
the coolest...

## POINTER 3057
That's it! 
I'm gonna be a hero with the Knights!<PAGE>That sounds like it'll be a lot more fun. 
I just hope my mom lets me.

## POINTER 3058
When I grow up, I'm going to the 
capital to join the Knights!

Are you ready? Follow this 
pathway and you'll exit 
into the coliseum.<PAGE>If you don't think you can handle it, 
it's not too late to back out. Of 
course, you'll forfeit your entry fee.

## POINTER 3081
These are the private 
quarters of Palestralle's 
leader, the Duce Belius.<PAGE>Only those with special 
permission may enter.

## POINTER 3082
Only a select few can ever 
meet the Duce Belius.<PAGE>Under normal circumstances, 
audiences are not permitted.

## POINTER 3083
If you want to see the Duce Belius 
so badly, come back on the night 
of the new moon.<PAGE>If you do, you will be permitted 
to speak with a messenger carrying 
letters from the Don.

## POINTER 3084
In Palestralle, they are organizing 
an elite force to deal with 
disturbances in the coliseum!<PAGE>Move along calmly, 
and no one gets hurt!

## POINTER 3085
Belius is dealing 
with the situation 
right now.<PAGE>Do NOT disturb her!

## POINTER 3086
Duce Belius will only grant 
audiences on the night of 
the full moon. Begone now.

## POINTER 3087
If you want to see the Duce 
Belius, come back at night.

## POINTER 3088
The Duce doesn't take 
meetings during the day; 
those are her orders.

## POINTER 3089
...I don't care if you go 
in, but the Duce is...you 
must already know...

## POINTER 3090
You may enter, but don't 
touch anything.

## POINTER 3091
Lord Natz is using these 
chambers in his capacity 
as interim Duce.<PAGE>If you have business, 
you may enter.

## POINTER 3092
Unlike Duce Belius, Lord Natz 
has specified that these rooms 
remain open to visitors. <PAGE>You may enter if you wish.

## POINTER 3093
Beyond are the offices of Lord 
Natz, the interim Duce.<PAGE>You may enter if you wish.

## POINTER 3094
Don't forget to knock before you 
enter. Make sure to knock twice.

## POINTER 3095
Soon enough these rooms will 
belong to Lord Natz, future 
Duce, current interim Duce.<PAGE>I'm sure he'll eventually be 
making use of Duce Belius's 
private chamber itself...

## POINTER 3096
This town is populated by 
miserable laborers, the knights 
that watch over them...<PAGE>...And the nobles 
that rule over all.

## POINTER 3097
I wouldn't even think about opposing 
the nobles, if I were you.<PAGE>If you catch their glare, you're liable to spend 
the rest of your life working in forced labor.

## POINTER 3098
Times of emergency require action!

## POINTER 3099
With any action always comes danger.<PAGE>However, the lack of action now always 
means a higher price to pay tomorrow.
