## POINTER 6100
<STR>(FRE)... I love you...
Look at me...
For the rest of my life, I'll...<PAGE>*Gasp*
...Was I saying something
in my sleep?

## POINTER 6101
There's something I've learned in being attacked by monsters.<PAGE>If you're planning on doing something, there's 
no time like the present for getting it done...

## POINTER 6102
<STR>(FRE)...
I rushed here...
to save you...<PAGE>*Gasp*... Oh, no, I drooled...

## POINTER 6103
I want to rush to 
Sir Flynn's side...<PAGE>I-I didn't mean 
it like that..!

## POINTER 6104
It's a rare thing indeed when the toils 
of today pay off as tomorrow's results.<PAGE>The wear and tear of each passing day always 
seems to show up at year's end, though...

## POINTER 6105
We tend to give up if we don't get 
the results we want right away.<PAGE>And that's a real tragedy, in a manner of speaking.

## POINTER 6106
Life's tragedy begins the moment 
we are born into this world.<PAGE>However, the comedy of life 
also begins with our birth.

## POINTER 6107
Intrinsically, darkness is the 
breeding ground of evil. This is 
the time we should be working. <PAGE>I don't know why, but it's 
probably by tradition that 
less people work at night.

## POINTER 6108
Humans need god to ensure 
their continued freedom.<PAGE>However, god depends on the people 
for his very existence.

## POINTER 6109
Surely, this is one of the 
great paradoxes of our age.

## POINTER 6110
There is no day or night in times 
of urgency. Our colleagues are 
working hard around the world. <PAGE>We cannot afford to 
lose ground here.

## POINTER 6111
It would be fair to say that this "god," 
as we call him, has soaked the pages 
of human history with blood.

## POINTER 6112
Sorry.
We're still preparing.<PAGE>Come again.

## POINTER 6113
Will you be staying? 
That will be 350 Gald.

## POINTER 6114
At last, the day's come to a close.

## POINTER 6115
Ahh, I can finally rest...

## POINTER 6116
Field manuals come in handy 
during peacetime...<PAGE>But they're all but worthless in a real emergency!

## POINTER 6117
If you want the truth, we were only able to 
defend the town because luck was with us.<PAGE>But without the strict training we 
undergo on a daily basis, lady luck 
would've never smiled on us today.

## POINTER 6118
This victorious outcome might've been a 
coincidence, but I know we also have our 
daily training to thank for our success.

## POINTER 6119
When our hard work is met with 
results, we gain confidence.<PAGE>Even if our efforts don't pay off, 
we benefit from the experience.

## POINTER 6120
Whether we accomplish our aims 
or not, putting forth the effort 
is winning half the battle.

## POINTER 6121
This town is rotten.
What do you mean, what?<PAGE>Knights are bound by confidentiality.
I cannot say...

## POINTER 6122
Do people leave
because the work becomes rush?<PAGE>Or do people leave
because it's rushed work...?
Oh, don't mind me.

## POINTER 6123
Welcome. Looking for anything 
in particular?

## POINTER 6124
Thanks very much. Please 
come see us again.

## POINTER 6125
Thank you very much.
Please come again.

## POINTER 6126
Damn it, another guy 
was supposed to take 
the night shift... <PAGE>But he said he wasn't 
staying up all night 
because he's a noble...!

## POINTER 6127
What does nobility 
have to do with it?! <PAGE>...I was supposed 
to go on a date!

## POINTER 6128
Damn it, night 
shift again! <PAGE>Why do nobles 
get the right to be 
selfish all the time?!

## POINTER 6129
If you've got time for burbling out nonsense in your sleep, 
how about putting your back into a little work!<PAGE>It will help you overcome this trial...

## POINTER 6130
There are a number of virtues we 
Knights must swear to live by.<PAGE>Did you know that?

## POINTER 6131
Justice, courage, trust, loyalty, love, courtesy, 
and wisdom. All seven are essential...<PAGE>But which would you value 
above all others?

## POINTER 6132
If a person feels positive emotion, they should wear it 
on their sleeve and cry it out for the world to hear.<PAGE>However, if we feel negative emotion, 
we must bear it in silence.

## POINTER 6133
This is because whatever emotions we may feel 
are amplified when we give voice to them.

## POINTER 6134
*Sigh*...
Another night shift...<PAGE>I got past the anger
and just completely gave up...

## POINTER 6135
The only thing I can say for certain is...<PAGE>He who breaks bread with me is my friend, and he who 
would steal that which is mine, he is my enemy.

## POINTER 6136
We wish you safe travels. 
Take care.

## POINTER 6137
It is wrong to assume that we'll be able to 
see the results of a single day's training.<PAGE>Be that as it may, we must not fail 
to train each and every day.

## POINTER 6138
I'm a believer.<PAGE>This punishing training will pay off one day...

## POINTER 6139
Doubt not god's existence, nor 
seek evidence of his presence, 
for god watches over us always.<PAGE>Give to god his due praise, but depend not upon his mercy...

## POINTER 6140
People are overly concerned with 
the question of god's existence.<PAGE>Can we humans not be content 
to live without puzzling 
over such things?

## POINTER 6141
Digging deep into the question of 
god's relationship with humanity...will 
lead us only to atheism.<PAGE>However, our ability to reach 
such a conclusion is proof, in 
itself, of god's existence.

## POINTER 6142
By the grace of Captain 
<STR>(FRE), the night shift 
gets a meal coupon. <PAGE>Hey, it's not bribery...

## POINTER 6143
Good evening. That's 
right, we're still open. 
Right this way.

## POINTER 6144
Thank you very much. 
Have a nice night.

## POINTER 6145
Good evening. Are you 
forgetting anything? Here 
now, have a look.

## POINTER 6146
Thank you very much. We look forward 
to seeing you tomorrow.

## POINTER 6147
The coliseum, where the blood is washed away with 
more blood... What a thrill! What I wouldn't 
give to die upon the stone slabs myself...<PAGE>That is my dream. Pretty wild, 
huh? At any rate, the coliseum's 
nowhere near here...

## POINTER 6148
Yormgen's lazy atmosphere 
just doesn't 
suit me.<PAGE>Someday, I'll stand in the ring 
of the coliseum, and watch 
the crimson blossoms bloom.

## POINTER 6149
So tell me, have you ever 
been to the coliseum?<PAGE>I've heard it has all the spectacle of 
a feeding frenzy. What did you think?

## POINTER 6150
Huh? You participated at the 
coliseum? I'm impressed you 
lived to tell the tale!<PAGE>It just goes to show that it's never safe 
to judge by appearances. Just what sort 
of crime did you commit, anyway?

## POINTER 6151
Out for a moonlit stroll like me?<PAGE>The sun-touched flowers have their charms, 
but I like the way the moonbeams dance across 
the flowers as well, almost like a dream.

## POINTER 6152
If only there were no monsters about, 
I could sleep at night free of worry...

## POINTER 6153
Make sure to watch your 
footing in the dark.<PAGE>I would hate to see your 
dog slip a paw between the 
slats in the bridge.

## POINTER 6154
There are fewer holes 
if you walk the bridge 
along its edges.

## POINTER 6155
That box... I feel as though 
I've seen it somewhere.<PAGE>Hmm, can't seem to recall 
where it was, though.

## POINTER 6156
If I say I can't remember, 
then I can't remember. My, 
but you're stubborn.<PAGE>I wouldn't expect you to remember 
what color shoes every person you 
met yesterday was wearing, would I?

## POINTER 6157
The Sage was saying he was gonna make 
some thingamajig out of some sort 
of stone. Amazing, isn't it?!<PAGE>I've plum forgotten what 
it was he made, though. 
I'm sure it was amazing.

## POINTER 6158
I said I couldn't remember what 
was so amazing about it, didn't 
I? My, but you're stubborn.<PAGE>Can you tell me just what 
makes the ocean so amazing? 
You can't, can you?

## POINTER 6159
You've made quite 
a journey here. <PAGE>But I'm afraid there's 
nothing special in 
this village...

## POINTER 6160
So you were the ones they found 
collapsed outside of town. That 
must have been quite a shock.<PAGE>You're welcome to stay in the village as 
long as it takes to regain your strength.

## POINTER 6161
Are you acquaintances 
of the Sage?<PAGE>Whatever could have brought 
you all the way to our 
sleepy little village?

## POINTER 6162
Forgive us, but we don't have much to offer 
you here in the way of sightseeing.<PAGE>Oh, have you been to see the northern 
mountain, yet? The scenery there 
is quite breathtaking.

## POINTER 6163
Are you not from these parts?<PAGE>There are so many flowers 
growing here, it's pretty, 
don't you think?

## POINTER 6164
Everyone who visits here says what 
a pretty town they think we have.

## POINTER 6165
Dee-zert? Desert? A desert 
filled with sand? You mean 
you came from a desert?<PAGE>Just where is there a desert?

## POINTER 6166
I've never seen a desert 
myself. You must have come 
from really far away.

## POINTER 6167
You came from across the sea? That 
must have been a tough trip.<PAGE>I'll bet you had to row a lot 
to get here. Huh? You didn't? 
Blas-cha? What's that?

## POINTER 6168
Huh? A-path-ee-ah? 
Does it taste good?

## POINTER 6169
They say that the monsters will stop coming 
if we build a...barrier, I think it 
was. Would that really keep us safe?<PAGE>If the Sage is saying it though, 
it must do what he says.

## POINTER 6170
If the Sage says it's so, then 
there's no doubt about it.<PAGE>How could I ever question 
what he tells us?

## POINTER 6171
Even at night, we can't 
be sure when the monsters 
will stage an attack.<PAGE>That's why we keep watch over 
the town in shifts like this.

## POINTER 6172
These monsters are capable of 
speech, so hopefully they 
sleep at night, like we do.

## POINTER 6173
I know what's going on. The Sage is trying 
to ease our fears by saying that the clear 
ciel crystal will keep out the monsters.<PAGE>Then he'll allow the monsters to attack 
when everyone is fast asleep... 
It sounds possible doesn't it?

## POINTER 6174
But not on my watch. I'm not 
standing here every night 
for no reason, you know.<PAGE>Don't get me wrong. It's not that 
I'm questioning the Sage. Even still, 
better safe than sorry, right?

## POINTER 6175
......<PAGE>You're a stranger....

## POINTER 6176
I'm not supposed to...talk 
to strangers...

## POINTER 6177
......<PAGE>U-umm...

## POINTER 6178
Stop it... 
Go away...

## POINTER 6179
How about sharing a cup of coffee
while we contemplate the moon?<PAGE>The moon's beauty and the aroma of the coffee 
mingle to wash clean the grime of a long day.

## POINTER 6180
And not just 
the moon 
itself.<PAGE>Just look how the moonlight plays 
over the ripples on the water.

## POINTER 6181
Here's to your future.

## POINTER 6182
It sounds like they've got what they need to build this 
barrier thing that's gonna keep the monsters out.<PAGE>Now Yormgen will be able to enjoy 
an everlasting peace... Now that's 
something to celebrate.

## POINTER 6183
Longchi...
How is he doing?<PAGE>He may be looking up
at this very moon too...

## POINTER 6184
I want to see him...<PAGE>I'm sorry,
he's all I've talked about...

## POINTER 6185
What did you talk about
with Longchi?<PAGE>Maybe spinning tops...?
He's always loved
spinning tops.

## POINTER 6186
I would appreciate
any small thing you can
tell me about when you saw him...

## POINTER 6187
With my father's sudden death, I took over 
his management of the village, but nothing 
seems to go according to my plans...<PAGE>I'm not sure what I'd do if the 
Sage weren't here to help me.

## POINTER 6188
If you're looking for the Sage, 
you'll find him in the largest 
house in the village.

## POINTER 6189
Actually, everyone in the village 
has lost some of their trust in 
me, on account of the Sage.

## POINTER 6190
It's a confusing feeling... I'm not sure 
if I should feel ashamed or relieved.

## POINTER 6191
I see you're awake.
Are you feeling better now?<PAGE>I found you collapsed
at the entrance to town.

## POINTER 6192
Oh, don't worry about the tab.<PAGE>I brought you here without your consent.

## POINTER 6193
Your friend
woke up a little while ago
and left.

## POINTER 6194
Welcome back.
It'll be 50 Gald for one night.
Do you wish to stay?

## POINTER 6195
Have a good day.

## POINTER 6196
Leaving so soon?<PAGE>You're quite welcome to 
stay as long as you like.

## POINTER 6197
You mustn't push yourselves to hard, 
or you may end up collapsing again.<PAGE>I'll have to start charging 
you rent the next time 
it happens. Heh heh.

## POINTER 6198
You're all dressed in 
such strange garments.<PAGE>You don't see clothing like 
that in these parts. Have 
you come from far away?

## POINTER 6199
I wonder if the food 
you're accustomed to 
is just as different.<PAGE>I'd love to hear about what sort of 
dishes you have where you're from, if 
it isn't too forward of me to ask.
