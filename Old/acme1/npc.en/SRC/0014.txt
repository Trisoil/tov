## POINTER 1400
If I could master Drunken Sword, 
I could work while I drink...

## POINTER 1401
This is where we mercenaries 
scout for work.

## POINTER 1402
Don't bother me.

## POINTER 1403
Thanks to Barbos, attitudes 
towards us mercenaries
have gotten pretty cold.

## POINTER 1404
I'm may be a mercenary, 
but I'm not part of the 
Blood Alliance...

## POINTER 1405
I'm scrambling every day
to regain the trust of
the tarnished mercenaries.<PAGE>Damn it, it's all 
Barbos's fault.

## POINTER 1406
How hard do I have to work
to regain that trust...?

## POINTER 1407
Hey, I saw it, that bird monster! 
Man, we're in trouble!<PAGE>I know we mercenaries are supposed 
to regain the trust of the people, 
but fighting that thing...?

## POINTER 1408
If you want that thing dead,
try barking up another guild.

## POINTER 1409
More resistance among 
the guilds? It better not be 
another mercenary guild.

## POINTER 1410
Any more bad reflections 
on the mercenaries, and 
we'll seriously be out of work.

## POINTER 1411
The more chaos befalls the 
world, the more the mercenary 
business flourishes.<PAGE>Even so, it is forbidden for us 
to create conflicts ourselves.

## POINTER 1412
Trust is number one in the guild business.
If you're caught cheating the system,
you'll be banished from the industry.

## POINTER 1413
I bet I could find plenty of jobs
in Zaphias right now.

## POINTER 1414
Of course, that's only 
if I could make it there.

## POINTER 1415
My sword is no match for that 
nasty monster in the sky.<PAGE>I don't think there's 
any other sword who can 
take it down either...

## POINTER 1416
No mercenary could 
take that thing down.<PAGE>There's nothing we can do...

## POINTER 1417
Confusion is spreading 
throughout the world... 
This is our moment to shine.<PAGE>This is a chance for 
us to make some 
dough before we die!

## POINTER 1418
I can protect a town, 
travelers, you name it.<PAGE>What do you guys say, 
you want to hire me?

## POINTER 1419
Don't talk to me 
or you'll get hurt.

## POINTER 1420
Don't talk to me 
or I'll bite.

## POINTER 1421
Don't talk to me 
or I'll throw sand 
in your eyes.

## POINTER 1422
Don't talk to me 
or you'll die.

## POINTER 1423
Don't talk to me 
or I'll rip every 
hair off your body.

## POINTER 1424
Don't talk to me 
or you'll get the chills.

## POINTER 1425
Don't talk to me 
or I'll poke your eyes out.

## POINTER 1426
Don't talk to me 
or it'll rain.

## POINTER 1427
Don't talk to me 
or I'll crush your spine.

## POINTER 1428
Don't talk to me 
or I'm going to sleep.

## POINTER 1429
Don't talk to me 
or I'll take your money.

## POINTER 1430
Don't talk to me 
or the ghosts will come.

## POINTER 1431
Don't talk to me 
or you'll live for a 
hundred more years.

## POINTER 1432
Don't talk to me 
or it's your funeral.

## POINTER 1433
Don't talk to me 
or I'll lie.

## POINTER 1434
Don't talk to me 
or the frog will ribbit.

## POINTER 1435
Don't talk to me 
or you'll grow taller.

## POINTER 1436
Don't talk to me 
or I'll become a giant.

## POINTER 1437
Don't talk to me 
or I'll fly.

## POINTER 1438
Don't talk to me 
or I'll talk.

## POINTER 1439
I might join for the 
chance to go up 
against the Empire.

## POINTER 1440
I can hardly wait to 
get in the action again. 
It's been a while.

## POINTER 1441
First knights, now mercenaries.

## POINTER 1442
I don't know how I feel 
about killing colleagues.

## POINTER 1443
I can't believe the Blood 
Alliance--the largest mercenary 
guild--could be defeated so easily.

## POINTER 1444
Wonder who stuck it 
to Barbos, anyway.

## POINTER 1445
I don't think it's 
going to be too easy 
getting the treaty signed.

## POINTER 1446
There's not chance the guilds
and the Empire can get along.

## POINTER 1447
This is my chance to 
make a profit, and I'm 
not feeling too good.<PAGE>I think I drank too much.

## POINTER 1448
*Hic!*

## POINTER 1449
I drank too much 
after some bad 
things happened.<PAGE>I'm a mess.

## POINTER 1450
Who will lead
the Union now?<PAGE>If the Hunting Blades becomes one 
of the five master guilds and Clint
takes over, I'll support them.

## POINTER 1451
Clint, the boss
of the Hunting Blades...
His beard is hot!

## POINTER 1452
Do you know Yeager
of Leviathan's Claw?<PAGE>His strange way with 
words is very unique.

## POINTER 1453
I've recently become 
a Yeager fan.
That's pretty hardcore, right?

## POINTER 1454
There aren't any
good men lately...<PAGE>Oh, but you...
...Oh, well, you're okay.

## POINTER 1455
I've been told that 
I have good taste 
in men. Lucky me...

## POINTER 1456
Do you know a person
named Sicily?<PAGE>His beard is so sexy!

## POINTER 1457
It's too bad 
Sicily isn't a 
member of a guild.

## POINTER 1458
Mercenaries speak 
with their blades.

## POINTER 1459
Words have no 
meaning for us.

## POINTER 1460
In the world of 
mercenaries, your 
ability is everything.

## POINTER 1461
Does Barbos really 
have the abilityto 
bring down the Union?

## POINTER 1462
So Barbos died 
after all.<PAGE>That's what I call 
divine justice.

## POINTER 1463
A man with a loud mouth 
is not fit to be a mercenary.

## POINTER 1464
I can't fight on an empty 
stomach. Hey, bartender! 
Bring the grub!

## POINTER 1465
An empty stomach is your 
worst enemy. That's the 
most important rule of war.

## POINTER 1466
No matter how much I 
eat, my stomach isn't full.<PAGE>I think I may be 
overworking myself...

## POINTER 1467
My food bills are getting 
out of hand... I just keep 
on eating and eating...

## POINTER 1468
The Don's dead.
Now it's finally my turn
to take control.

## POINTER 1469
Everyone has a chance.
That is the guild world.

## POINTER 1470
This town and this world 
are always changing.<PAGE>I'm the only one unchanged.

## POINTER 1471
Come on, me, pull 
yourself together...!

## POINTER 1472
They say to eat in 
moderation, but a real 
man eats until he's full!<PAGE>The more you eat, 
the better you work 
for the guild!

## POINTER 1473
Bartender! 
Food! 
Lots of it!

## POINTER 1474
I can't think when I'm hungry. <PAGE>What's worse is I can't think 
when I eat too much, either.

## POINTER 1475
If it's all the same anyway, 
it's better to be full, right?

## POINTER 1476
Beyond this point 
are the private rooms
of Union officials.<PAGE>If you are here 
to see the Don,
it's the last room.

## POINTER 1477
You're not allowed 
past this point.

## POINTER 1478
Beyond this point 
are the private rooms
of Union officials.<PAGE>You can exit from the left.

## POINTER 1479
Beyond this point 
are the private rooms
of Union officials.<PAGE>If you are here to 
see the Don, you can 
exit from the left.

## POINTER 1480
Beyond this point 
are the private rooms
of Union officials.<PAGE>Things are a little shaky 
because of the difficulty 
in choosing a new Don.

## POINTER 1481
I formed my own guild!
That's why I'm here, to 
register it with the Union.

## POINTER 1482
The registration process 
is so hard. I'm really 
having a hard time.

## POINTER 1483
What? Monsters?
What a great opportunity!
Our guild's first job!

## POINTER 1484
Let's go!! 
We're going to 
defend this town!!

## POINTER 1485
I-I never actually fought monsters 
before... They're terrible! M-my 
hands are still shaking...

## POINTER 1486
M-my hands are still shaking...

## POINTER 1487
We've got the Don on our side! 
The Empire's finished!

## POINTER 1488
If the Don holds the reins 
with a strong grip, we too 
can become dauntless warriors!

## POINTER 1489
So there are even sruggles
within the Union...

## POINTER 1490
Barbos has guts.
I mean, he's going 
up against the Don.

## POINTER 1491
I'm looking for new 
guild members. You 
want to join my guild?

## POINTER 1492
I'm thinking of 
starting a guild to 
research old games...<PAGE>But I can't seem to get 
approval from the members.

## POINTER 1493
I started a guild, 
but I don't know 
what to do with it...<PAGE>What should I do?

## POINTER 1494
What? A mercenary guild?

## POINTER 1495
What? Monsters?
Now's our chace!
Our guild's first job!

## POINTER 1496
...Now this is starting to look 
like a mercenary guild...

## POINTER 1497
We have no idea what's going 
to happen. All we know is 
we're defending this town!

## POINTER 1498
I love this town! I 
would risk my lifeto 
protect this guild city!

## POINTER 1499
If only we were a little 
stronger...the Don wouldn't 
have had to die. <PAGE>What's going to happen to the 
Union with the Don gone?
