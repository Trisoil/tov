## POINTER 3900
There are tournaments in which one warrior goes up against
another, or there are the last-man-standing tournaments 
that have 100 warriors going for each other.<PAGE>And they say there is a monster in the coliseum, 
you may even have to fight that.

## POINTER 3901
You have to apply special formulae directly to
the monsters' bodies to get them inside a barrier.<PAGE>Look closely at the monsters in the coliseum,
and you'll see that they all have tattoos.

## POINTER 3902
Some bastard destroyed the
blastia that locked up the monsters.
Who would do something like that?!

## POINTER 3903
Our reverse barrier blastia 
are a total loss.<PAGE>Whoever did this, 
he's packing some serious firepower...

## POINTER 3904
Palestralle has always governed this town, 
and they've always handled security...<PAGE>I hope a bunch of knights 
hanging around doesn't 
stir up trouble.

## POINTER 3905
We were doing 
just fine with 
Palestralle governing.<PAGE>If the Empire tries to push all 
their unfamiliar structure on us, 
they're going to get burned.

## POINTER 3906
Those knight bastards...
they're trying to take this 
city for themselves, aren't they?<PAGE>We've got warships in the port, 
knights patrolling the city... 
what's going to happen to the coliseum?

## POINTER 3907
If the coliseum falls completely 
under the Empire's jurisdiction, 
you can bet it'll get damn boring.<PAGE>We'll all be bound up in rules and regulations, 
and this town will go straight into the privy.

## POINTER 3908
There was an argument between 
Palestralle and the Knights about who 
would stand guard around the coliseum.<PAGE>You know how we decided it? 
With rock, paper, scissors!

## POINTER 3909
We lost guard to
the Imperial Knights.<PAGE>At least that game
of rocks, paper,
scissors was fun...

## POINTER 3910
Cases of trouble between the Knights
and citizens have increased since the
Imperial Knights are here.<PAGE>Crime rate in general has
gone down. That’s probably
because of the tightened security.

## POINTER 3911
I still don't welcome the 
Knights' presence here.<PAGE>But...I do have to admit 
some things have gotten 
better since they arrived.

## POINTER 3912
Not all knights are bad.<PAGE>If you take time to talk to
each one, you’ll find that
most of them are good people.

## POINTER 3913
Even if they’re decent
people, there’s something
wrong with the system.

## POINTER 3914
Registration for the competition
is just up ahead.<PAGE>How do I know? Anyone carrying
weapons that sized must be here
for the competition...

## POINTER 3915
Everyone’s after the
grand prize, but don’t
over do it.<PAGE>Don’t underestimate
those monsters.

## POINTER 3916
What’s aer? Are those the
things that makes blastia run?
No, wait. Those are the cores.<PAGE>Oh, I don’t know.
Huh? A book?
I don’t read books...

## POINTER 3917
I don’t know about aer,
but I know what éclairs are!<PAGE>They’re those yummy
chocolate covered pastry right?

## POINTER 3918
What happened there!? 
A bearded old man with a 
pale face leapt from the coliseum!<PAGE>Twice the usual noise 
coming from that place! *Hic!*

## POINTER 3919
The guy who just jumped out, is he 
one of the Ruins' Gate folks that 
have been wandering around town? *Hic!*

## POINTER 3920
Surging power...muscles of steel... 
one million horsepower...<PAGE>Grab those monsters, tear 'em up 
and scatter 'em... tear 'em up and 
scatter 'em... Whew! All right!

## POINTER 3921
All right! I've got
the battle all worked
out in my mind...<PAGE>Ahh...but it's still scary...

## POINTER 3922
There I am standing...
Victory...Basking in glory
in defeating that monster.<PAGE>I can do it!
I can do it!!

## POINTER 3923
*Sigh*...
I won....
in my mind, that is....

## POINTER 3924
I am great!
I am excellent!
I am strong!<PAGE>You guys are all trash!

## POINTER 3925
I feel stronger
just by changing
the way I talk!<PAGE>Um...I just *feel* stronger....

## POINTER 3926
I'm gonna get stronger...
and stronger...and...
stron...ger...zzzzzzz...

## POINTER 3927
...Wha...?! What am I 
doing hypnotizing 
myself...?

## POINTER 3928
I can't do this...
I want to go back
to Zaphias.

## POINTER 3929
I want to sleep in a warm bed...
I want to eat good food...
I can't live like this...

## POINTER 3930
Older gentlemen who shoot a little higher 
must remain cool and gallant, even 
when doing battle with monsters!<PAGE>Of course, sometimes we need to 
make a daring flourish, steal the 
hearts of the crowd, be a star!

## POINTER 3931
Older gentlemen who shoot a little 
higher dodge the monsters' attacks 
with grace and style!<PAGE>We cement the lovely lasses' lingering 
gazes upon us, and might even 
get to take one home with us!

## POINTER 3932
Older gentlemen who shoot 
a little higher should be 
calm in these situations,<PAGE>and be rid of the monster 
with one telling blow!

## POINTER 3933
Take that! 
Bring it on 
monsters!<PAGE>The older gentleman puts 
an end to you right here!

## POINTER 3934
Older gentlemen who shoot a little 
higher can make the crowd laugh 
with even boorish jokes!<PAGE>All this while cutting down monsters 
and vanquishing foes!

## POINTER 3935
Older gentlemen who shoot a little 
higher don't let their power intoxicate 
them when they're drunk!<PAGE>Rather, they play up the fact they're soused, 
crush their enemy, 
and make it a new trademark!

## POINTER 3936
Older gentlemen who shoot a 
little higher refrain from revealing 
their melodious voices too early!<PAGE>Instead, they roar like beasts while fighting, 
then finally raise a mighty, yet beautiful, 
cheer upon victory! The girls go wild!

## POINTER 3937
Older gentlemen who shoot a little 
higher keep a low profile and live in the shadows!<PAGE>We only show our faces if our true love is in a jam, 
bail her out in the blink of an eye, 
and are gone like the wind!

## POINTER 3938
Older gentlemen who shoot a little 
higher aren't trifled by the sad or distressing!<PAGE>We take it all with smiles on our faces, 
fight to win, shed manly tears of victory, 
and own the hearts of women everywhere!

## POINTER 3939
Older gentlemen who shoot a little higher 
may be hamfisted, but they shrewdly play 
such hamfistedness to their advantage!<PAGE>We pull subtly on our fans' heartstrings, all the 
while landing our moves with radiance and panache!

## POINTER 3940
Older gentlemen who shoot a little 
higher don't overestimate their ability!<PAGE>Rather, we do the best with what we have, 
simultaneously strive to outdo ourselves, 
and never fail to conquer our foes!

## POINTER 3941
Older gentlemen who shoot a little higher 
keep talk of themselves to a minimum 
and make excellent listeners!<PAGE>This allows us to capture hearts everywhere 
and win people over to our side!

## POINTER 3942
Older gentlemen who shoot a little 
higher never deny their opponents' strength, 
but neither do they deny their weaknesses!<PAGE>Instead, we accept reality as it is, 
always striving to ever-greater heights!

## POINTER 3943
Older gentlemen who shoot a little 
higher put themselves last, 
and hurry to others' rescue first!<PAGE>And we take care of ourselves even as 
we're solving other peoples' crises!

## POINTER 3944
Older gentlemen who shoot a 
little higher should have no 
regard for their own safety,<PAGE>but beat the creepy monster to snuff 
just like it were any other upstart!

## POINTER 3945
Older gentlemen who shoot a 
little higher should be undaunted 
by unknown monsters!<PAGE>Demonstrating their abilities 
with the toughest of men!

## POINTER 3946
Older gentlemen who shoot a little 
higher focus all their heart and soul...<PAGE>...into never becoming careless, nor envious...<PAGE>...and achieving blazing hot passion!

## POINTER 3947
Wouldn't it be nice to be that kind of 
older gentleman...? Maybe some day...

## POINTER 3948
I was supposed to be placed 
on security detail in Zaphias... 
What am I even doing here?<PAGE>It was Lieutenant Leblanc
that brought me here, wasn't it...? 
That capricious old weasel...!

## POINTER 3949
He's not a bad person, 
but it's so easy to speak badly of him...

## POINTER 3950
Three days ago, I never would have 
imagined I'd be shipped off to 
such a strange, faraway land...*Sigh*<PAGE>I just don't know how I feel...

## POINTER 3951
I wish this mission would wrap up already. 
Where are our orders to return home...?

## POINTER 3952
Well, if it isn’t <STR>(YUR)! It’s me! 
I’m working under <STR>(FRE) command. 
We enlisted together!

## POINTER 3953
We joined the knights
together. You don't
remember me?

## POINTER 3954
The three of us used to
always have dinner together
at the dorm after work.

## POINTER 3955
You don't remember?
It's me!

## POINTER 3956
Quiz time! Who am I? 
Hint: Moustache.<PAGE>Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock...
buzzzzz!!

## POINTER 3957
You don't know who I am?

## POINTER 3958
Here, I'll do an impression of 
Lieutenant Leblanc for you.<PAGE>"<STR>(YUR)! You won't
get away with this!"

## POINTER 3959
You...still don't know who I am...?

## POINTER 3960
Hey, did you forget
who I am?

## POINTER 3961
Maybe you haven't forgotten at all. 
Maybe you didn't bother to remember 
me in the first place...

## POINTER 3962
Unlike Duce Belius, 
Lord Natz has specified that these 
rooms remain open to visitors.<PAGE>You may enter if you wish.

## POINTER 3963
Beyond are the offices of Lord Natz, 
the interim Duce.<PAGE>You may enter if you wish.

## POINTER 3964
Don't forget to knock before you enter. 
Make sure to knock twice.

## POINTER 3965
Soon enough these rooms will 
belong to Lord Natz, future 
Duce, current interim Duce.<PAGE>I'm sure he'll eventually be
making use of Duce Belius's
private chamber itself...

## POINTER 3966
I'm just the receptionist's assistant, 
so talking to me is irrelevant! 
The receptionist is next to me♪

## POINTER 3967
Welcome! Are you looking to take part?
I'm sorry, but We are currently
not accepting applicants.

## POINTER 3968
Welcome! I'm the receptionist's assistant.

## POINTER 3970
Please try again 
another time.<PAGE>A fierce battle will 
be waiting for you!

## POINTER 3971
It seems something 
happened in the coliseum.<PAGE>We are currently not accepting 
applicants until the current 
situation is resolved.

## POINTER 3972
This is the new
registration booth.<PAGE>We're not ready right now
And we're probably never 
going to be ready!

## POINTER 3973
Don’t miss out on 
the next new tournament!♪

## POINTER 3974
Are you ready? 
Follow this pathway and you'll 
exit into the coliseum.<PAGE>If you don't think you can handle it, 
it's not too late to back out. 
Of course, you'll forfeit your entry fee.

## POINTER 3975
I'm not scared... 
I'm not scared...<PAGE>I can do it... 
I can do it...

## POINTER 3976
I-I threw away my entire life 
in Zaphias to come here...<PAGE>I c-can h-h-handle a 
few monsters, right...?

## POINTER 3977
A mo..monster 
escaped...!?<PAGE>I..I’m scared...!

## POINTER 3978
What’s happening up there!? 
I..I have to run...<PAGE>Mmm...My legs 
won’t move...!

## POINTER 3979
I'm strong... I'm powerful... 
I'm the strongest in the world... 
Strongest in the whole universe...

## POINTER 3980
Yeah, now I'm totally psyched up...
But, wait...<PAGE>I'm still scared...

## POINTER 3981
I'm still standing... 
Victory... I defeated my foe...<PAGE>I really can do it... Really I can...!

## POINTER 3982
*Sigh* 
I always win...
in my mind...

## POINTER 3983
I'm el hombre mas fuerte 
del mundo! You're all 
nothing but swine!

## POINTER 3984
It feels like just changing 
my vocabulary has made 
me stronger...<PAGE>But...it just feels that way...

## POINTER 3985
I'm...I'm all washed up... 
I-I want to go back 
home to Zaphias...

## POINTER 3986
I want to sleep in a nice warm 
bed... eat tasty food... I'm 
tired of this misery...

## POINTER 3987
Torim Harbor is east from the exit
on the other side.<PAGE>During this season, the Sirens
are pretty loud.

## POINTER 3988
Head west out of
that exit to get to Dahngrest.<PAGE>There's a huge bird-like monster
flying around there,
so it's pretty dangerous.

## POINTER 3989
Torim Harbor is east from the exit
on the other side.<PAGE>Right now, the Fortune's Market is
reigning supreme.

## POINTER 3990
Head west out of
that exit to get to Dahngrest, but...<PAGE>Ever since Don died,
I hear it's been utter chaos.

## POINTER 3991
Torim Harbor is east from the exit
on the other side.<PAGE>There's nothing but talk about
the ruins that appeared
on the southern seas.

## POINTER 3992
Head west out of
that exit to get to Dahngrest.<PAGE>Since Don's death,
the Union is struggling
to regain order.

## POINTER 3993
Torim Harbor is east from the exit
on the other side.<PAGE>There is some commotion
about the monsters in the sky.

## POINTER 3994
Head west out of
that exit to get to Dahngrest.<PAGE>There's talk that they'll show us
with those monsters in the sky.

## POINTER 3995
We can't forgive the 
imperial family. They should 
be condemned for this.

## POINTER 3996
All this trouble lately has 
served to prove one thing. <PAGE>We don't need an emperor.

## POINTER 3997
We, the nobles, will lead 
the Empire from now on. <PAGE>The age of imperial 
autocracy is over.

## POINTER 3998
The Knights are the sword of 
justice. The shield of the weak. 
We can retreat not a step.

## POINTER 3999
We are all that stand before the citizens. 
We shall protect Zaphias with our lives!
