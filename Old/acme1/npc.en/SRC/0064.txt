## POINTER 6400
That's how it was. 
Or was it this way? <PAGE>It's not like this. 
That phoenix was 
more like...

## POINTER 6401
Don't interfere! Don't 
blame me if I burn you with 
my burning artistic heart! <PAGE>Heh heh heh... ♪ Fire!

## POINTER 6402
The present capital
is very interesting! <PAGE>Some people are frightened, 
others struggle to escape... They all 
have quite unusual expressions.

## POINTER 6403
Do you think that's a little 
shameless? But it's my duty as an 
artist to draw people's expression. <PAGE>There's more value in drawing 
these real expressions than 
making up smiling faces.

## POINTER 6404
Next, I'd like to draw 
the two young candidates 
to the emperor's throne.

## POINTER 6405
I heard the two candidates 
are allowed to walk around 
outside without a bodyguards!<PAGE>I would like to express 
their fearless and bold 
countenances on canvas!

## POINTER 6406

The guild's management told me to 
increase nighttime profitability. 
So...could you buy something?

## POINTER 6411
Fortune's Market, where there's 
a heart for business and first-class 
products! Thanks for visiting!

## POINTER 6412
There shouldn't be problems with 
night-time business under these 
conditions. Have a look around.

## POINTER 6413
Fortune's Market, 
where business is life! 
Thanks for coming!

## POINTER 6414
Welcome! We won't close 
our night business as long 
as there are customers.

merchants until we die!

The shop is open at night 
because you never know when 
someone might get hurt.

you're happy we're still open! 
Thanks for coming!

We got great products today!

Fortune's Market, in step with 
tomorrow's bright future! 
Thanks for coming!

## POINTER 6420
...What are you looking at?

## POINTER 6421
Are you lonely?

## POINTER 6422
You finally have someone 
that'll stick with you.

## POINTER 6423
I know that you're 
happy, but you don't have 
to come and show off...

## POINTER 6424
I'm <STR>(FRE) Defense 
Force member 006.♪ <PAGE>Don't tell him. 
It's a secret.

## POINTER 6425
You'll become bored 
of eventless days. <PAGE>Life has to have 
some excitement!

## POINTER 6426
Don't you feel 
empty staring at us?

## POINTER 6427
Poor thing.

## POINTER 6428
...Are you boasting?

## POINTER 6429
Aren't you trying too 
hard? Aren't you part of the 
wrong social standing? <PAGE>It's not about the 
numbers. It's about the 
depth of your love.

## POINTER 6430
My girl friend is acting strange. 
She says she has other plans and 
won't go out on a date with me.

## POINTER 6431
My girl friend is sitting 
right beside me, and she 
won't even look my way. <PAGE>What's going on, 
all of a sudden?

## POINTER 6432
The previous emperor, Krunos 
XIV, passed away due to an 
illness that was going around.

## POINTER 6433
Although the Emperor is determined 
hereditarily, Krunos XIV didn't 
have a direct successor. <PAGE>That's why the selection 
of the next Emperor has 
been a lingering issue.

## POINTER 6434
The wind at night is chilly.

## POINTER 6435
Longjohns are essential 
when going out at night.

## POINTER 6436
The taxes rose again. 
The taxes in Zaphias
are too high.

## POINTER 6437
The Council gets to do 
what they want in the 
absence of the emperor. <PAGE>I'd like to see 
the emperor take 
over the throne.

## POINTER 6438
Zaphias holds so many memories 
for me. The house that I inherited 
from my parents is here, too. <PAGE>It may be dangerous, but I 
don't really want to leave.

## POINTER 6439
I am prepared to 
be buried here.

## POINTER 6440
What's up with the Knights recently? <PAGE>I heard they seized the castle, 
split into two groups and are 
now fighting each other.

## POINTER 6441
Isn't it the job 
of the Knights to 
guard Zaphias? <PAGE>How can they fight each 
other and just ignore 
the capital completely?!

## POINTER 6442
The monster is 
writhing in the sky...

## POINTER 6443
I can't sleep wondering 
when that monster will 
come crashing down.

## POINTER 6444
That monster up there... 
Did it always live there 
in the sky? <PAGE>So we've been 
living under that 
monster all this time.

## POINTER 6445
That's scary!

## POINTER 6446
I lived in another city 
before coming to Zaphias. <PAGE>I've been living away 
from other Krityans 
for a while now.

## POINTER 6447
Nighttime is when 
I'm really glad that 
we have blastia. <PAGE>I mean, I couldn't sleep 
at night without a barrier 
blastia. I'd be so worried...

## POINTER 6448
Hey! You're that 
wanted guy!<PAGE>I would help keep the 
capital safe if I caught 
a wanted man...<PAGE>For now, I need to start 
with meeting more 
people in the capital. <PAGE>Now I know the lower quarter
and the people who live here.

## POINTER 6449
The Knight standing in front 
of the gate now is different 
from the usual Knight. <PAGE>He's got a bad 
reputation because he's 
always slacking off.

## POINTER 6450
I want to guard 
the gate instead.

## POINTER 6451
I thought the blastia was 
secure, but I guess not...

## POINTER 6452
There is something 
strange going on with aer 
with this much disarray...

## POINTER 6453
I decided to guard the 
capital and its citizens. <PAGE>The area around the barrier 
has calmed down, but that 
doesn't mean nothing will happen.

## POINTER 6454
Should we really 
rebuild the town now? <PAGE>Everyone evacuated the 
lower quarter. We don't 
have enough people.

## POINTER 6455
Can we count on 
the Knights or not?

## POINTER 6456
There are all kinds of Knights. Some 
who would give their lives to fight, 
and some who just run away. <PAGE>It's nice that people are 
different, but can an organization 
really function like that?

## POINTER 6457
It's been a while since 
I battled monsters. I remember 
how I used to feel. <PAGE>I guess this is what 
I'm cut out to do.

## POINTER 6458
Maybe I'll join 
the Knights. <PAGE>I should infuse some energy 
into those wimps and rebuild 
them from the inside.

## POINTER 6459
I ran out of sugar when 
I was making dinner.

## POINTER 6460
You live in the lower 
quarter, right? <PAGE>Why don't you come over 
for dinner sometime?

## POINTER 6461
The lower quarter is 
having water issues. <PAGE>I can't make dinner 
without water.

## POINTER 6462
Did you eat dinner 
already? If not, how 
about eating at my place?

## POINTER 6463
There's a meeting for 
the <STR>(FRE) Defense Force. 
I have to hurry.

## POINTER 6464
I'm late because 
I was preparing dinner 
for my family. <PAGE>I should have each person 
just buy whatever on 
their own from now on.

## POINTER 6465
The imperial family monopolized blastia 
and got hooked on money and power. 
That's why Zaphias wound up like this.

## POINTER 6466
Isn't it about time that 
the citizens rebel against 
the imperial family?

## POINTER 6467
What's going to happen 
to the Empire?

## POINTER 6468
We have our share of 
uncertainty in our ranks. But 
we must protect the capital. <PAGE>That is our solemn 
duty as Knights.

## POINTER 6469
We're all gonna end up 
getting eaten by monsters, 
anyway. I'm going to bed!

## POINTER 6470
This 'round the clock guard 
duty can't go on forever. 
Our bodies'll apart.<PAGE>You either die now, or you die 
later. That's the only difference. 
Fighting is such a waste of time.

## POINTER 6471
Inns are always busiest at night. 
<STR>(YUR), you of all people 
should know that! <PAGE>If you're not gonna help 
people outside, go clean up 
the bottles from that table.

## POINTER 6472
<STR>(YUR), if you're gonna rest, 
just go on to your own room. <PAGE>I'll get a room ready for 
your lady friend, too.

## POINTER 6473
Did you feed 
<STR>(RAP)? <PAGE>If not, I have 
some leftovers 
you can give him.

## POINTER 6474
What do you want 
for dinner, <STR>(YUR)? 
I'll cook whatever you like.

## POINTER 6475
Your room's 
ready for you, 
so you can go on up.<PAGE>Relax, nobody's gone in your room, 
<STR>(YUR).  Of course, that means 
it hasn't been cleaned, either.

## POINTER 6476
You came all the 
way back here. Why don't 
you take a break?

## POINTER 6477
<STR>(YUR), just take your time 
and do what you need to do.

## POINTER 6478
Ted's sick, 
so he's resting 
now. <PAGE>I swear, that child. 
I told him not to go out, 
but did he listen? No...

## POINTER 6479
If this weirdness keeps up, 
I don't think we'll be able to 
keep living in the capital. <PAGE>I'll hold on for a 
little longer, though.

## POINTER 6480
Welcome back, <STR>(YUR). 
You sure are working hard.

## POINTER 6481
You make sure you rest 
properly, now. Go on. 
Everyone already went up!

## POINTER 6482
I don't care if the barrier 
goes down or monsters attack. 
I will protect this home. <PAGE>So don't you worry 
about us back here, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 6483
I'll be sure you have 
a home waiting for you 
when you get back.

## POINTER 6484
You know, <STR>(YUR), you and <STR>(FRE)
started out with different purposes, 
but now you're working together. <PAGE>It's kinda nice to see you 
two working together again.

## POINTER 6485
I'm sure we'll be all right with you 
and <STR>(FRE) working together. Show 
them what you're made of, <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 6486
<STR>(YUR), you're still 
hanging around here?<PAGE>The old lady's gonna kick 
your butt if you don't 
do what you gotta do.

## POINTER 6487
Owww...
The old lady should lighten up...<PAGE>I was just sitting out back for 
a little bit. Okay, so 
maybe I had a drink...

## POINTER 6488
Hey, if you have some 
time, could you go get 
some water for me?

## POINTER 6489
You know what? 
The old lady is 
so nice to you. <PAGE>I mean, even if she yells at you, 
she never kicks your butt. 
It's, like, everyday for me.

## POINTER 6490
You're gonna stay 
here tonight, right? <PAGE>Let's have a drink after 
I finish my work.

## POINTER 6491
Tell me about your travels. 
Man, I'm finally gonna get 
to have a fun night. <PAGE>...If the old lady doesn't 
come barging in, that is.

## POINTER 6492
It looks like they set up a 
"<STR>(FRE) Defense Force" 
in the citizen quarter. <PAGE>I hear Ted got 
interested and started 
offering them information.

## POINTER 6493
So, hey, where's the 
<STR>(YUR) Defense Force?

## POINTER 6494
The guy that used to work 
for us left the capital, too. <PAGE>Now I gotta find someone 
else to do the work.

## POINTER 6495
Oh well. Business is pretty 
dead, now, so I don't need 
anyone right away. <PAGE>I'm actually more 
worried about getting 
customers than workers.

## POINTER 6496
Hey, <STR>(YUR). It's been a 
while since you first 
left on your trip. <PAGE>Heh, I think trip has actually 
done you a little good.

## POINTER 6497
You know, <STR>(YUR), those 
ladies you're traveling with 
look pretty strong. <PAGE>Come on, honestly. They wear the 
pants, right? No matter how strong 
men are, we're suckers for women.

## POINTER 6498
Don't worry, <STR>(YUR). 
Even if you all aren't around, we'll 
protect the lower quarter.

## POINTER 6499
Yeah, we'll be all 
right. We'll just 
do what we can.
