My family and friends boarded 
a refugee ship, and 
made for the south.<PAGE>I've been left all alone...but 
it can't be helped.

## POINTER 2301
I have prepared myself! 
What will my tomorrow be?

## POINTER 2302
Nocking a silver arrow in my 
bow, I take aim at the unholy 
shadow looming in the sky.<PAGE>Thus is the mark of the Imperials; 
thus my arrow shall pierce 
that unholy shadow.

## POINTER 2303
It's all come down to this. To be 
concluded, in the final chapter!

## POINTER 2304
Hmm? I don't remember 
the continuation... 
Umm... <PAGE>Hmm? Outside? Ahh, it 
made a loud sound. It 
doesn't really matter.

## POINTER 2305
....Don't interfere 
with my work. <PAGE>Don't speak 
to me!

## POINTER 2306
The unholy shadow has vanished, but 
it is not yet time to rest easy.<PAGE>Even should the fearsome shadow 
return to menace the world again, 
I am not afraid. The End.

## POINTER 2307
Huh...I was sure I was writing 
nonfiction, but somehow 
it turned into fantasy...

Welcome. You've 
come to the only 
store in Torim.∀

## POINTER 2316
Thank you, please 
come again!∀

## POINTER 2317
This is the Fortune's 
Market stock warehouse. <PAGE>It's a mess in there. 
Trust me, you don't 
want to see it.

## POINTER 2318
I get so depressed
when I think about
having to clean it up...<PAGE>Yep... There goes
another day without
cleaning it up...

## POINTER 2319
Ragou closed down the Capua Norrr 
porrrt...and now we can't even 
run ourrr Linerrr Serrrvice.

## POINTER 2320
We'rrre the famous and 
fabulous Torrrino 
Linerrr Serrrvice!

## POINTER 2321
Ourrr regularrr linerrr, the Strrratos, is 
currrently being dismantled and inspected. <PAGE>Sorrry, but it's not 
going anywherrre.

## POINTER 2322
Forrr some reason, the 
Strrreit hasn't come back 
from Capua Norrr.<PAGE>Sorrry, but Linerrr Serrrvice 
is out of operrration.

## POINTER 2323
The Torrrino Linerrr Serrrvice 
is a just Guild!<PAGE>The Strrreit's sailing 
south with refugees 
aboarrrd.

## POINTER 2324
The Torrrino Linerrr Serrrvice, always 
prrroviding safe and easy trrravel!<PAGE>We anticipate the sea being ratherrr 
dangerrrous, so the Linerrr 
Serrrvice is suspended.

## POINTER 2325
With the worrrld is steeped in 
such unpleasantness, we've 
suspended the Linerrr Serrrvice.<PAGE>I can't even hazarrrd a guess as 
to when we'll set sail again.

## POINTER 2326
We've finally decided 
to change ourrr 
business model. <PAGE>Frrrom now on ourrr 
Guild is in the 
frrreight trade.

## POINTER 2327
We'rrre the famous and fabulous 
Torrrino Li...err, Frrreight 
Serrrvice!

## POINTER 2328
Out on the sea 
I heard a terrible noise.<PAGE>I could see a lot of smoke. 
Could it have been an accident?

## POINTER 2329
Maybe they were attacked by the Capua Nor
magistrate again and they sank their ship.

## POINTER 2330
Ye hear the rumors about the battered old 
ship nobody's never seen before, sailin' 
the seas with not a single soul on board?<PAGE>If'n yer plan to get out on the 
ocean, ye be careful, now.

## POINTER 2331
The sea still be holdin' a bucketful 
of mysteries, it do.

## POINTER 2332
The battered ship be frightsome, 
but so be the mermen.<PAGE>They be maraudin' ships in packs, 
draggin' seamen to their deaths 
at the bottom o' the sea.

## POINTER 2333
If'n yer plan to 
set sail, ye best 
be wary o' both.

## POINTER 2334
Who's that running off yonder? 
Did he just 
see a merman?

## POINTER 2335
The sea be full'o terrifying 
creatures... But this is the 
attraction o' the mighty sea.

## POINTER 2336
If'n yer plan to set sail, 
ye best be wary 
o' both.

## POINTER 2337
So the Don be dead, eh? Dahngrest do be 
goin' through its fair share o' troubles.<PAGE>For the time bein', we'll be 
fine here in Capua Torim wi' 
Fortune's Market around.

## POINTER 2338
Twill be fine, 'twill 
be fine! We be havin' 
Kaufman in this town.<PAGE>Have yer ever given any thought to 
settlin' down in Torim yerselves?

## POINTER 2339
I seen 'em! I seen the 
skies over Zaphias, the 
most frightsome skies!<PAGE>How glad I be that Zaphias 
lay across an entire ocean.

## POINTER 2340
The Zaphians truly be havin' it tough. Not 
that there be much we can do to help them.

## POINTER 2341
There be somethin' strange arisen 
in the middle of the sea...<PAGE>Ah, do ye think it may 
have somethin' to do with 
that battered ship?

## POINTER 2342
Surely the Knights will be 
doin' somethin' about it.

## POINTER 2343
The town be in bedlam, but there 
be nothin' to worry about.<PAGE>The Knights are sure to 
be takin' care o' things.

## POINTER 2344
O' course, I'll be fine as long 
as that there thing don't be 
fallin' on top o' my head.

## POINTER 2345
Ho, lad, what ye think 
that strange tower over 
on Ilyccia yonder be?<PAGE>It be so tall, the top be 
hidden in the clouds.

## POINTER 2346
What could it be? An observatory 
o' some sort?

## POINTER 2347
Far off on this continent 
to the west is the den of
our guilds.<PAGE>They call it Dahngrest! 
Visit sometime.

## POINTER 2348
That reminds me, they say there's 
a mercenary town off to the northwest. 
Or was it abandoned?

## POINTER 2349
Nordopolica in Desier 
is governed by a Guild 
called Palestralle.<PAGE>Their main business is operating 
the coliseum there.

## POINTER 2350
There aren't any other Guilds 
that run an entire town.<PAGE>People think Altosk governs 
Dahngrest, but it belongs 
to the Guild Union.

## POINTER 2351
The Union was part of the reason 
Fortune's Market was doing such 
good business with the Empire.<PAGE>If the Don's death wrecks the world's 
power balance, will the Guilds 
even be able to survive...?

## POINTER 2352
The Empire will come and try to 
crush the Guilds all at once.<PAGE>If that happens, Empire 
rule here in this town 
will intensify.

## POINTER 2353
The Don and Belius...I thought the deaths of 
the two chief Guild leaders would have the 
Empire really starting to hack away at us.<PAGE>But now there's this 
Knight rebellion...

## POINTER 2354
If the Guilds take this chance to 
recover their footing, they could 
actually stand up to the Empire.

## POINTER 2355
Knights versus knights? There 
are some alarming things 
happening in the Empire.<PAGE>Without anyone to hold 
the Union together, it's 
in a shambles, too.

## POINTER 2356
With the Don dead, it might 
be time for the Guids to go 
through some big changes.

## POINTER 2357
The Empire? The Guilds?<PAGE>Looking at that awful thing in the sky 
makes the little borders men fashion 
for themselves seem so ridiculous.

## POINTER 2358
Even so, I'm staying with the Guild. 
Just the sad saga of a man who can't 
live without his borders...

## POINTER 2359
What's to be done 
with the world now?<PAGE>There isn't a single person left 
among the elite of the Guilds or the 
Knights who can tackle that question.

## POINTER 2360
All us bottom-feeders 
can do is worry...

## POINTER 2361
Do you know what these plants 
are? They're all indigenous 
to the Tolbyccian tropics.<PAGE>On this continent strong 
rains fall frequently.

## POINTER 2362
If you travel further to the west, 
I'm sure you'll come to understand what 
makes this continent so unique.

## POINTER 2363
This continent encloses the sea, and 
at the heart of the sea is a point known 
as the Waters of the Waning Moon.<PAGE>Nobody knows who 
gave it this name.

## POINTER 2364
There are creatures who live deep 
below the Waters of the Waning 
Moon, at the bottom of the sea.<PAGE>As is written in Chapter 18 
of the Pirate's Memoirs.

## POINTER 2365
Rain is frequent here, but 
conversely it falls hardly 
at all in Desier.

## POINTER 2366
It's so hot in Desier and 
yet it doesn't rain. It 
must be very difficult.

## POINTER 2367
Have you ever been to the 
desert in Desier? You have? 
That's impressive.

## POINTER 2368
Is it true that cactuses 
at night are full 
of water?

## POINTER 2369
The skies over Ilyccia 
are so strange.

## POINTER 2370
The weather has truly 
been in chaos lately.

## POINTER 2371
Hey do you have any idea 
why they sky over the 
capital went so weird?<PAGE>I try and try, 
but I just can't 
figure it out.

## POINTER 2372
Wh-what's that thing in the 
sky? I don't know what it is.

## POINTER 2373
This is no longer any time to be 
making idle chat about the rain.

## POINTER 2374
Fortune's Market uses this town 
as their base of operations.<PAGE>There aren't any heavy taxes like 
in Capua Nor, but there are a lot 
of restrictions on business.

## POINTER 2375
*Sigh*...doing business in this 
town is so difficult unless you're 
part of Fortune's Market.

## POINTER 2376
The port in Capua Nor was 
reopened, and they say there 
will be a new magistrate.<PAGE>Maybe I should take 
my sales there...

## POINTER 2377
The people of Capua Nor
revere those who 
expelled the magistrate.

## POINTER 2378
The Don died? If that 
shakes up the balance 
of the Guilds...<PAGE>...Perhaps Fortune's 
Market's control 
will weaken...?

## POINTER 2379
Doing business here might very 
well become a lot easier...

## POINTER 2380
I hear a great deal of 
people from Zaphias have 
come to Capua Nor.<PAGE>I wonder if setting 
up business there would 
be lucrative...

## POINTER 2381
Of course, I don't want to 
get caught in any awful 
situations over there...

## POINTER 2382
I really respect the salesmen 
from Fortune's Market...<PAGE>It's such an uncertain time, but even 
so they bark out their sales calls with 
such verve. It's so wonderful...∀

## POINTER 2383
That's a true salesman...I 
have to learn from them.

## POINTER 2384
I thought of a little something 
that might sell well.<PAGE>Rings in the shape of those 
ruins on the sea, maybe.

## POINTER 2385
Maybe that would be a little shameless...? 
But no, sometimes that's what 
a real saleswoman needs.

## POINTER 2386
Hey, listen...I thought of 
another great idea. That sickening 
thing in the sky...<PAGE>Do you think stuffed 
animals of that 
thing would sell?

## POINTER 2387
When they're done I'll have 
you be my focus group.

## POINTER 2388
Many different guilds make 
their headquarters here.<PAGE>The most powerful among 
them is supposed to be the 
Blood Alliance, but...

## POINTER 2389
Hmm...mercenaries, 
I just don't know...

## POINTER 2390
Barbos, the head of the Blood Alliance
is a man that clawed his way
to the top through sheer skill.<PAGE>The rumors say he was
murdered. Could that be true?

## POINTER 2391
Barbos was domineering, arrogant, 
and selfish, but he was certainly an
able man.<PAGE>I want to know who is capable 
of defeating such a man.

## POINTER 2392
First Barbos, now the Don? Can you 
believe two heads of the Five 
Master Guilds died so suddenly?

## POINTER 2393
What will happen to the Union 
with the Don dead, I wonder.

## POINTER 2394
Something seems to have happened over 
in Zaphias, but I suppose it doesn't 
really affect us here in Torim.

## POINTER 2395
It seems like the Empire's 
getting restless.

## POINTER 2396
They even say some young 
knight or other helped 
out one of the Guilds.

## POINTER 2397
Just look at that hideous 
beast in the sky. If only 
we still had the Don...

## POINTER 2398
How are one or two of 
us supposed to face 
that thing alone?

## POINTER 2399
Welcome, welcome! How'd you like 
to sell me some of your memories? 
One memory, five Gald!<PAGE>Huh? Too cheap? Hmph...
