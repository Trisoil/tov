## POINTER 6000
1 Gald today becomes 2 Gald tomorrow, and 4 Gald 
the day after that... And so on and so forth...<PAGE>How many Gald do 
you think that is 
after a month?

## POINTER 6001
My life has become bountiful.<PAGE>But we must never grow complacent.

## POINTER 6002
Money and fire are no different.<PAGE>Used carefully they can be quite handy. Put 
them to indiscriminate use though, and everything 
you love might go up in smoke.

## POINTER 6003
This is the weapons depot.<PAGE>No one may enter without 
permission.

## POINTER 6004
Whenever night rolls around, I can't 
help wondering to myself..<PAGE> Is this town actually what 
we're here to defend...?

## POINTER 6005
When weapons are used, people die. 
But if accept that weapons are necessary 
to keep the peace, then...<PAGE>It's a rather glaring contradiction.

## POINTER 6006
Do you think an ideal world 
would be free of weapons?

## POINTER 6007
When two sides come to quarrel, each 
must strive to cool the heat of their 
emotions, first and foremost.<PAGE>Following this, each party should 
eat their fill, and reopen negotiations 
on a full stomach.

## POINTER 6008
I guess they found a mistake 
I made. Oh, a demotion... <PAGE>My wife, my daughter, 
forgive this pitiful man...

## POINTER 6009
All of my colleagues served 
<STR>(FRE) and got promoted, but 
I'm still stuck here... <PAGE>Why, oh, why...?

## POINTER 6010
It is a good thing to be able to sleep 
away the night without worry...

## POINTER 6011
You'll be heading to the woods
outside Torim Harbor from here.<PAGE>It gets dark and you can
get yourself lost easily,
so be careful.

## POINTER 6012
You've got to be pretty brave
to be going outside the barrier.
You aren't even knights.

## POINTER 6013
You're going outside town?
I say you forget about it...<PAGE>It's safer to stay inside
the barrier. Trust me.

## POINTER 6014
This is a good workplace. <PAGE>I feel sorry for my colleagues 
working dangerous missions 
outside of the barrier.

## POINTER 6015
If you exit here, you'll be 
heading towards Torim Harbor. <PAGE>You'll have to enter Dahngrest 
from the front entrance.

## POINTER 6016
But is it not wiser to wait in patience...?<PAGE>To wait for night's 
eventual brightening?

## POINTER 6017
You've got a forest teeming with 
monsters, so be careful. <PAGE>...No, really, be careful. If 
you're worried, it's best if you 
stayed inside the barrier.

## POINTER 6018
The survival of the people no longer depends 
on their ability to steal what food they can.

## POINTER 6019
It's a Knight's desire to die 
helping someone in need! <PAGE>If you have no purpose, 
it's better to rust 
and whither away!

## POINTER 6020
To be brought low standing in the service 
of others is a Knight's great ambition.<PAGE>No joy can exceed it!

## POINTER 6021
Incompetent Knights 
blame their weakness 
on their swords. <PAGE>The idiots. They're 
the weak ones!

## POINTER 6022
The true Knight reflects upon and 
learns from his failed efforts.

## POINTER 6023
Living each day as though it may be your 
last, but seeking always to better yourself 
as though you will live an eternity.<PAGE>This is the way of life of a Knight.

## POINTER 6024
A knight should be prepared to
give his life for the citizens!

## POINTER 6025
Swinging our swords to protect 
the country, we bloody our 
hands and become sinners. <PAGE>But it is because of this 
sacrifice that we Knights 
atone for our sins!

## POINTER 6026
For only in this can there be salvation 
from the blood-stained lives we 
who don the armor must lead.

## POINTER 6027
The gap between the haves and the have-nots 
is not likely to be filled quickly, even though 
Cumore is no longer in the picture.

## POINTER 6028
But if we listen with care to the voices 
of the less-fortunate, and tend to 
their concerns one at a time...<PAGE>A day will surely come when this town 
will rise to its full potential.

## POINTER 6029
Of the many proud achievements the 
Knights can claim, not a one was 
accomplished by our power alone.<PAGE>The Knights could not hope to function without 
the combined support of all the people.

## POINTER 6030
It is this system of support, that allows 
us to pour our every effort into 
whatever we may struggle against.

## POINTER 6031
If most people could manage to think 
rationally and control their emotions, 
most conflicts could be avoided. <PAGE>If all people could do these 
things, conflicts would 
cease to exist entirely.

## POINTER 6032
If most people could manage to think 
rationally and control their emotions, 
most conflicts could be avoided.<PAGE>If all people could do these 
things, conflicts would 
cease to exist entirely.

## POINTER 6033
Can you think of anything equal in weight 
and importance to the life of a person?<PAGE>Are we Knights right to risk our lives 
for glory, and the praise of others?

## POINTER 6034
As far as I've been able to learn, 
there is nothing in this world quite 
so precious as human life.<PAGE>No matter how important something 
may seem, all things pale in comparison 
before the sanctity of life.

## POINTER 6035
Go right ahead!

## POINTER 6036
We will protect the night 
city because Captain 
Flynn has come! <PAGE>Bring it on! We can 
take on any criminal!

## POINTER 6037
The freedom these people gained when 
Cumore fell from power... In the 
end, it doesn't amount to much.

## POINTER 6038
The Knights do what must be done.<PAGE>We cannot allow personal misgivings, obstacles, 
dangers, or pressures to stand in the way.

## POINTER 6039
This is the underlying principal of knighthood.

## POINTER 6040
The guilds and the Empire 
are enemies. The Union 
controls the guilds... <PAGE>It is about time that 
people free themselves 
from these rules.

## POINTER 6041
The only embarrassment is in refusing to 
acknowledge our own weaknesses, or in not 
attempting to understand those of others.

## POINTER 6042
If there is one thing the history 
books teach us, it is that wars 
are contests between powers.<PAGE>In such struggles, the ones who 
suffer most are those furthest 
from the sources of power.

## POINTER 6043
No matter how we may wish to see it, make no mistake, 
the sword of a Knight is an implement of war...<PAGE>And a mind filled with thoughts of justice is 
indispensable for it to be put to proper use.

## POINTER 6044
They say people 
live to eat.<PAGE>Well, a Knight lives 
to shed blood 
for the people.

## POINTER 6045
Even if the food be plain, it 
is better than none at all.

## POINTER 6046
The birth of each person holds in 
it an important meaning, I am sure.<PAGE>However, if each person does not come to this realization 
on their own, such meaning will be lost.

## POINTER 6047
Each person must come to understand 
the meaning of their own existence.<PAGE>If they do, they will find the bravery 
to endure hardship, and the hope of 
a new day will rise within them.

## POINTER 6048
My job does not end 
when the sun sets. <PAGE>In fact, nighttime is when a 
Knight's real duty begins.

## POINTER 6049
After all, you will never be 
anything more or less than yourself, 
be it day or night...

## POINTER 6050
The country is in danger. 
Now is the time that we 
Knights can truly shine. <PAGE>The lay people's place is behind 
us, trembling in fear!

## POINTER 6051
Our youth flies by before we can understand 
time's true worth, and after reaching adulthood, 
we are kept endlessly busy...<PAGE>In our old age, the majority of our time is 
spent suffering the discomfort of illness.

## POINTER 6052
All people are more or less 
the same, at heart.<PAGE>Is it not that politics are really to blame for creating 
the differences that separate one person from the next?

## POINTER 6053
Do not the attitudes 
of those above...<PAGE>Determine whether those below 
are seen as evil or as good?

## POINTER 6054
There is no harm in stumbling 
when we fail at something.<PAGE>There is value even in this, so long as we examine 
the reasons why, and learn from our mistakes.

## POINTER 6055
If we become able to see our failures as valuable 
experiences and useful lessons, success 
will be waiting just around the corner.

## POINTER 6056
We shouldn't waste time worrying whether 
every choice we make is right.<PAGE>No one but the 
gods can be right 
all the time.

## POINTER 6057
What's important is to make up our minds quickly, 
and then to act upon our decisions.<PAGE>If we do, though we may be mistaken, 
we will often have the time 
to repair our wrongs.

## POINTER 6058
Before criticizing or casting blame 
on others, try to find something 
in them worthy of praise.<PAGE>In so doing, you will remove 
much of the sting of scorn 
from your words.

## POINTER 6059
It won't do to raise your voice, no matter how 
angered you may sometimes become. Instead, 
keep your cool by counting slowly up to 10.<PAGE>If your anger remains unabated, count to 
100. Still seething? Make it a thousand.

## POINTER 6060
According to my research, 
this town has a large 
number of workers.<PAGE>It just goes to show that 
regardless of your class, 
people have to work.

## POINTER 6061
The power to change the world reveals itself 
only at times of great despair...<PAGE>And comes to those who do not 
falter in their efforts.

## POINTER 6062
People are worrisome creatures...<PAGE>Such caution can often be helpful.

## POINTER 6063
However, we cannot let it hold us back.<PAGE>We must remember to move forward, worrying as we go.

## POINTER 6064
Status and pedigree, money, and profession... 
Such things are unnecessary when 
it comes to making people happy.<PAGE>It might be said, rather, that they impede happiness.

## POINTER 6065
Happiness exists only within 
the hearts of people.<PAGE>Those who draw contentment from life though they live 
in cramped quarters, are poorly fed, and dress only 
in rags, can be said to truly know happiness.

## POINTER 6066
Those who practice what they preach 
sleep soundly at night...<PAGE>Those who cannot manage this, sleep restlessly 
and are haunted by their dreams...

## POINTER 6067
There's no reason to despair simply because 
you have a nightmare or two, however.<PAGE>The very act of our birth into this world, in a sense, 
is the beginning of a nightmare, after all...

## POINTER 6068
If we wait in line for hand-outs, we 
can receive some food at no cost.

## POINTER 6069
Being able to eat without working for it...<PAGE>It's every man's dream!

## POINTER 6070
We all want life to be a little easier, 
and if that means getting a free-lunch, 
well then, why not?

## POINTER 6071
Water can't help but run down hill... 
You can't get more natural than that.

## POINTER 6072
Slackers and hard workers aren't all that 
different when you get down to it.<PAGE>No matter who you are, you're gonna spend 
about half your life sleeping, right?

## POINTER 6073
Apparently, if you're somebody who wastes all 
your time working, they call you "diligent."

## POINTER 6074
What is it that 
I must do? <PAGE>It is my job to 
think about that.

## POINTER 6075
I get a feeling it's my calling to spend 
my time trying to figure that out.

## POINTER 6076
The night is my friend... 
And despair is my guide...

## POINTER 6077
This town defines the very absence 
of hopes and dreams.

## POINTER 6078
Someone once told me, "Life is nothing 
but suffering and fear!"<PAGE>And now that very time is at hand!

## POINTER 6079
We're all destined to writhe 
in horror as we die.

## POINTER 6080
People spend their lives writhing and 
squirming, trying to outrun destiny...<PAGE>And what is the result...? It always 
catches up to them, of course.

## POINTER 6081
If we turn and face our fate, rather than escaping from 
it, it will be our destiny that is forced to flee.

## POINTER 6082
To be a Knight is to live in honor. We talk 
of honor as if it were some grand idea.<PAGE>Do you have any idea how boring living 
a life of honor really is...?

## POINTER 6083
Join the Knights and you'll find out soon enough.

## POINTER 6084
Each person walks to the beat of a different drummer.<PAGE>All you can do is walk your own walk, 
but it's bound to give you your 
own unique scenery as you go.

## POINTER 6085
Take the nobles, for example, sitting so proudly in their 
palanquins, as they're ferried about by the commoners...<PAGE>Because of their position they 
sit above everyone else, and have 
a better view than all of us.

## POINTER 6086
A Knight's job does not consist of parading 
around in a suit of shiny armor.<PAGE>Our true work is to pick up the refuse 
that no one else will touch, in a way.

## POINTER 6087
There is plenty of garbage left in this town, under 
the guise of discrimination and injustice.

## POINTER 6088
Words are truly mysterious 
things.<PAGE>They can instill in people the 
will to live, and they can also 
tear such a hope to pieces.

## POINTER 6089
Maybe it's a prerequisite for officials 
to be talented wordsmiths.

## POINTER 6090
The stupid blastia, trying 
to defy humans... <PAGE>If it weren't related to 
the barrier, I would smash 
it into pieces...

## POINTER 6091
They go on shining, never 
moving, but reveal to 
us all the way forward.

## POINTER 6092
The commoners should be made 
to stand watch at night... <PAGE>All of this because we're 
short a few men.

## POINTER 6093
It's nothing to puzzle too hard over.<PAGE>The important thing is 
to be true to yourself.

## POINTER 6094
It's because of the Cumore Brigade 
and our resource management that 
this town is developing! <PAGE>The commoners should accept their 
place under our control!

## POINTER 6095
If you're not to keen on dying, I'd 
recommend going with giving up.

## POINTER 6096
<STR>(FRE)...
<STR>(FRE) is amazing...
I knew he'd do it...<PAGE>*Gasp*
...I wasn't sleeping!

## POINTER 6097
Save yourself the trouble, and 
stop fighting the inevitable!

## POINTER 6098
<STR>(FRE)...
I'll always... stand by...
...stand by you...<PAGE>*Gasp* ...Oh, <STR>(FRE)...
You're not him...

## POINTER 6099
It's best to do whatever work you can get 
your hands on while you're still young...
