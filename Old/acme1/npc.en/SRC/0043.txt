## POINTER 4300
What is a 
non-noble doing here 
at this hour? <PAGE>You're not the thief that 
everyone's talking about?

## POINTER 4301
Don't stand behind me. <PAGE>I cannot ensure your life 
if you stand behind me.

## POINTER 4302
The only reason you can walk 
around at night is because of the 
street light blastia. <PAGE>We also benefit from 
barrier blastia and aque 
blastia in Zaphias.

## POINTER 4303
Appointments to the 
emperor's advisory body are 
determined by our committee... <PAGE>But I really haven't 
done much.

## POINTER 4304
The entire council 
has been bad mouthed and is in 
chaos due to a certain magistrate, <PAGE>even though I'm 
such a good person...

## POINTER 4305
I heard that his accomplice 
interfered with the core 
of Zaphias's blastia. <PAGE>Handling the blastia 
without the proper knowledge 
could lead to disaster.

## POINTER 4306
The Commadant barricaded 
in the castle is the 
source of the problem. <PAGE>We councilors were also 
overrun by the Knights 
and chased to the castle.

## POINTER 4307
You'll be punished for 
mishandling the blastia. <PAGE>Do you think the Commandant 
will be all right?

## POINTER 4308
What's going on? It looked 
like the Sword Stair formula 
shot something really far away.

## POINTER 4309
I can't stand the abuse 
the blastia are taking... <PAGE>We're the ones that 
determine who gets 
blastia and who doesn't.

## POINTER 4310
The path we're on will be 
destroyed... It's too late. 
There is no other way.

## POINTER 4311
The appearance of the 
Adephagos is a countdown 
to destruction. <PAGE>The history of 
Kritya shows this.

## POINTER 4312
The thing that appeared to 
the north looks like the 
top floor of the tower. <PAGE>We can't construct such a high 
tower with today's technology.

## POINTER 4313
Is that tower from 
the Geraios Civilization...? <PAGE>But what for...?

## POINTER 4314
Hey! Could you please 
not suddenly disturb me?!

## POINTER 4315
I've been on the lookout, 
watching the mansion to 
confirm the rumors. <PAGE>I'll immediately call 
for the knights if a thief 
enters the premises.

## POINTER 4316
I succeeded in 
reporting to the knights 
the other day. <PAGE>I've been 
on the lookout 
for any thieves.

## POINTER 4317
I think the poor are causing 
too much of an uproar just because 
their taxes have increased a little. <PAGE>I guess those slow-witted people 
that can't even put their assets 
to use have no choice.

## POINTER 4318
If you can't buy 
bread, just eat cake. <PAGE>It's so sad that something 
as simple as that 
doesn't get around.

## POINTER 4319
D-d-don't scare 
me like that...

## POINTER 4320
Naturally, you would come 
to say hello when you're moving 
into the neighbourhood. <PAGE>I'm waiting here ready 
to give you advice.

## POINTER 4321
I'm on the watch 
with the lady next door 
to look out for thieves

## POINTER 4322
I heard there's a reward 
for finding thieves. <PAGE>It's just 10,000 Gald, but 
I guess money is money.

## POINTER 4323
Recently, a lot of poor people 
have been trying garner sympathy 
by bringing their pets.

## POINTER 4324
I won't fall for your sob 
story about your dog.

## POINTER 4325
You've been sitting around 
until this late hour... 
Oh well...

## POINTER 4326
You came to 
demand water, right? 
Are you statisfied? <PAGE>What a shameless man.

## POINTER 4327
If the poor loiter around 
here, they'll be arrested 
by the Knights. <PAGE>Well, I'm the one 
that'll notify them.

## POINTER 4328
I'll accept the commotion caused 
by the thieves during the afternoon 
the other day as dignified. <PAGE>On the other hand, 
I think those who sneak 
in at night as vulgar.

## POINTER 4329
You can at least 
go around groveling 
to gather coins.

## POINTER 4330
People say it's dangerous 
to go walking alone at night, 
but it's hard to resist. <PAGE>Moonlight strolls... 
Ahhh, so beautiful.

## POINTER 4331
Look around at the capital
at night, and you can just 
feel the peace and quiet.

## POINTER 4332
You're collecting 
Gald at this hour? <PAGE>I've heard that Gald is easier 
to find at night since the city 
lights shine off the coins.

## POINTER 4333
The tourists that come 
to see the capital throw 
Gald into that lake.

## POINTER 4334
I saw the dragon 
when there were problems 
with the capital's aer. <PAGE>That was probably 
an Entelexeia.

## POINTER 4335
I wonder if that dragon came 
to eat the capital's aer.

## POINTER 4336
I saw someone that looked 
like the Commandant of the 
Knights leaving the city. <PAGE>He flew away!

## POINTER 4337
What really happened 
in the castle?

## POINTER 4338
I see you a lot, but you 
don't really work in the 
royal quarter, do you?

## POINTER 4339
There will be no looting. 
Do you hear me?

## POINTER 4340
Is that tower a hand of salvation 
from the heavens, or a 
hammer borne of the earth? <PAGE>Heh heh. 
I'm a pretty good 
poet, aren't I?

## POINTER 4341
Is that a tower of 
hope or depair?

## POINTER 4342
It's like those people in 
the underworld are crowded 
into a little, tiny hole. <PAGE>Ahh. 
I want to crush 
them so badly...

## POINTER 4343
Squish... <PAGE>Well, just kidding.

## POINTER 4344
The underworld 
is newer than 
the royal quarter. <PAGE>They may have status 
now, but they were nothing 
a few generations back.

## POINTER 4345
We'll soon have to put 
them in their place. <PAGE>We should make that clear. 
Just a few squishes...

## POINTER 4346
A thief entered the mansion 
during the evacuation! <PAGE>It was a looter, I'm telling 
you! I can't let that go!

## POINTER 4347
Do not disrupt 
the guards. <PAGE>They'll arrest any thief that 
uses the chaos with the destroyed 
barrier to try something funny.

## POINTER 4348
The knights barricaded 
there aren't listening 
to anyone! <PAGE>They only provide half-hearted 
answers and have no intension 
of responding properly.

## POINTER 4349
What in the world? 
They're tax thieves!

## POINTER 4350
There were a few things 
missing when I vacated 
the mansion for a while. <PAGE>A thief must 
have broken in.

## POINTER 4351
I'll give up on the stolen goods. 
I don't think the Knights 
have time for that. <PAGE>That would only matter 
if you were alive.

## POINTER 4352
Actually, the ladies here followed 
that knight for an entire day 
and have not stopped complaining. <PAGE>The Knights are 
greatly worried... 
I feel sorry for them.

## POINTER 4353
Keep this conversation a secret 
from the other ladies.

## POINTER 4354
What the... 
It's creepy...

## POINTER 4355
A part of that sky
monster fell somewhere.<PAGE>It was really huge.
I hope there wasn't any
town where it fell.

## POINTER 4356
There now is a tower
where it used to be
the northen mountains.

## POINTER 4357
What could that be?<PAGE>I've never heard of anything 
like that before!.

## POINTER 4358
Huh? 
What about 
your blastia? <PAGE>I don't care 
about blastia. 
Don't waste my time.

## POINTER 4359
I'm telling you, 
I don't know anything 
about blastia.<PAGE>If your blastia broke, 
just buy a new one!

## POINTER 4360
I've got a serious problem. 
Don't bother me.

## POINTER 4361
I'm trying to figure out what to 
do with all my money. I have more 
than I know what to do with. <PAGE>Huh? You want some? Show me 
your best antlionz impression 
and just I might consider it.

## POINTER 4362
Zaphias' barrier has disappeared! 
It must be repaired immediately!

## POINTER 4363
I came back to Zaphias
because I heard it was safe. <PAGE>But the barrier has 
disappeared, and there's 
a monster in the sky.

## POINTER 4364
Will that beast be in the sky 
no matter where we run? <PAGE>Perhaps Zaphias is 
the safest place. 
We have the Knights here.

## POINTER 4365
Someone do something! 
What the hell is that thing?! 
What happened to the barrier?!

## POINTER 4366
I'm a noble! 
I'll give you all the 
money you want! <PAGE> Someone! Anyone! 
Get rid of that thing!

## POINTER 4367
Security's light in the royal quarter
because it's relatively safe. <PAGE>The lower quarter and citizen quarter
would get attacked first. 
Everyone's guarding those areas.

## POINTER 4368
Of course, the nobles are 
all worked up saying we're 
not protecting them. <PAGE>That's why I hate the royal 
quarter post... It's easier 
dealing with the monsters.

## POINTER 4369
The guilds aren't just 
anti-Empire organizations, they're 
autonomous groups seeking freedom...<PAGE>...Or so this guy here tells me.

## POINTER 4370
<STR>(YUR)! Come on, you 
can't be that slow.<PAGE>Ted left ages ago. 
Stop twiddling your thumbs, 
<STR>(YUR), and get a move on!

## POINTER 4371
I'm busy 
with my chores! <PAGE>I don't have any time to 
play with you, <STR>(YUR)! 
Hmph!

## POINTER 4372
<STR>(YUR)... 
You're going to save 
us, aren't you?<PAGE>That's why you came back, right?

## POINTER 4373
You and your friends 
fixed that weird sky, right <STR>(YUR)? <PAGE>Now we can go out and play! 
Thank you...tee-hee!â™ª

## POINTER 4374
Are you gonna leave again, <STR>(YUR)? <PAGE>Everyone's gonna work together 
and fix the town back up, 
so come back soon!

## POINTER 4375
<STR>(YUR), are you feeling down?

## POINTER 4376
I heard <STR>(FRE) made a 
new town, but you're not 
going, are you, <STR>(YUR)? <PAGE>This is your home, after all.

## POINTER 4377
This is your home to come back to, 
<STR>(YUR). I'll always have something 
nice and hot ready for you to eat!

## POINTER 4378
<STR>(FRE) came to tell us 
about the danger in Zaphias.<PAGE>He evacuated the citizens to the 
port town. I swear, <STR>(FRE)'s the 
only one actually doing his job.

## POINTER 4379
That weird thing with 
the sky seems to have fixed itself.<PAGE>The evacuees won't come 
back for a while, but we gotta 
fix up the lower quarter.

## POINTER 4380
The Knights are handling the 
city's security. <PAGE>We should be thankful they took charge... 
without the barrier, we're 
helpless against monster attacks.

## POINTER 4381
They say <STR>(FRE) led all the 
refugees to build a new town.<PAGE>I'm sure that 
wasn't his intention...
It just happened, right?

## POINTER 4382
When everything's back to 
normal,  <STR>(FRE) will come 
back to Zaphias.<PAGE>He's from the 
lower quarter, after all.

## POINTER 4383
Wait...it was you!<PAGE>Real men have short hair! 
Go cut it! It's so confusing!

## POINTER 4384
Drink up, don't let 
the drink drink you up!<PAGE>Ha ha ha ha ha ha! 
Yeah, yeah... 
I know, I know!

## POINTER 4385
I ain't drunk. 
Ain't drunk  at all! 
Ha ha ha ha ha...ugggh...

## POINTER 4386
The Empire may have the power 
in Zaphias, but it's different 
outside the city.<PAGE>There are towns in which the guilds are 
much more influential.

## POINTER 4387
The guilds started as vocational 
organizations formed by people who 
took issue with the Empire's rule.<PAGE>That feeling of opposition 
remains today, and the guilds
don't like the Empire at all.

## POINTER 4388
It's as if all light 
left Halure when the 
Tree withered.

## POINTER 4389
Hey! Listen! 
The Tree of Halure died!

## POINTER 4390
How I loved to gaze 
at the blossoms...

## POINTER 4391
There must be some way 
to bring the Tree of 
Halure back to life...

## POINTER 4392
First we have to 
investigate what made it 
wither in the first place.

## POINTER 4393
Who knew that the darkness 
could be so terrifying...?

## POINTER 4394
Can't we repair the 
blastia somehow?

## POINTER 4395
I suppose we'll just have 
to sleep on this problem.

## POINTER 4396
This is our mayor's house.

## POINTER 4397
I think the mayor's inside.

## POINTER 4398
If you follow the hill 
up, you'll arrive 
at the Tree of Halure. <PAGE>Of course, it's dead now...

## POINTER 4399
The Tree stood solidly 
there at night... 
It was really eerie.
