## POINTER 3600
Just look at the low folk 
miserably crawling about 
in the muck again today. <PAGE>Don't you wish you could 
crush them beneath your heel?

## POINTER 3601
They wear filthy rags and 
eat garbage. An absolutely 
dreadful existence! <PAGE>If I got thrown into the 
lower quarter, I'd lose 
my sanity in two minutes.

## POINTER 3602
I bet if I tossed down a few Gald 
from here I could get them all to 
make a mad scramble for it!<PAGE>How I'd like to try...

## POINTER 3603
Look at that pack of 
hyenas down there. 
Disgusting!

## POINTER 3604
Zaphias' barrier has disappeared! 
I'll bet it broke again! 
We must inspect the barrier blastia!

## POINTER 3605
Researchers from Aspio
must be summoned to fix the 
barrier blastia at once!

## POINTER 3606
There was a giant earthquake! 
The shock came from the north!

## POINTER 3607
Thanks to that nasty earthquake, 
all my elegant furniture and 
crockery is smashed!<PAGE>Who do I sue 
for damages?!

## POINTER 3608
I returned because 
I heard the capital
was safe again. <PAGE>So what are you 
commoners doing in 
the royal quarter?

## POINTER 3609
It is best to be in the city 
no matter what might happen.<PAGE>After all, the Knights are 
here to protect Zaphias.

## POINTER 3610
A long, thin structure 
appeared to the north. <PAGE>It's so tall it pierces the clouds. 
I wonder how far it goes...? 
You can't see the top.

## POINTER 3611
How could such a gigantic 
thing have been built?

## POINTER 3612
I knew it. The capital's 
back to normal. It's because 
we nobles are well-protected.

## POINTER 3613
I'm not worried about 
monsters or the barrier.<PAGE>Why? Because the 
nobles are protected!

## POINTER 3614
First that hideous monster, 
now a strange tower. 
Anything can happen...

## POINTER 3615
Who cares what's next, as long as 
Zaphias is safe. I don't give 
a damn about anyone outside!

## POINTER 3616
Do something! 
Somebody go get a 
powerful mage or something!<PAGE>What are we supposed 
to do if the barrier 
vanishes again?!

## POINTER 3617
I'm a noble! 
I'll give you all the 
money you want!<PAGE>Someone, anyone! 
Get rid of those monsters 
around Zaphias!

## POINTER 3618
The Knights and all the other 
nobles say it's safe now, 
but that thing's still in the sky. <PAGE>How can it 
possibly be safe? 
Well?!

## POINTER 3619
Who can I trust? 
Who's going to save me? 
Somebody tell me, please!

## POINTER 3620
We treasure the Tree 
of Halure as much 
as we do our lives.<PAGE>So to us, you all 
are our saviors. We 
owe you our lives.

## POINTER 3621
Any problem you have--any 
problem at all--don't 
hesitate to let us know.

## POINTER 3622
We decided to take 
in refugees from 
the capital. <PAGE>And we're so encouraged 
by His Highness Ioder's 
support.

## POINTER 3623
We are all fellow 
compatriots! <PAGE>If the people of the capital
are in trouble, we must 
extend a helping hand.

## POINTER 3624
Do you know how long 
the Tree of Halure has 
been here? <PAGE>I do.

## POINTER 3625
They say the Tree of 
Halure has been here since 
my grandpa was a kid.

## POINTER 3626
My grandpa just 
sleeps all the time. 
He never gets up. <PAGE>I wonder if it's just old age...?

## POINTER 3627
I feel great! 
I'm young! <PAGE>...I just get a little 
dizzy sometimes...

## POINTER 3628
I'm sure the flowers are 
pretty because they bloom 
as hard as they can! <PAGE>To honor them... 
I'm gonna drink 
as hard as I can!

## POINTER 3629
Ohhh... 
Nothing beats drinks 
under the blossoms...

## POINTER 3630
I feel kinda dizzy... I wonder 
if it's the drinks... <PAGE>But... 
It feels a little... 
different...

## POINTER 3631
Ugh... 
I'm pretty sure this... 
isn't a hangover...

## POINTER 3632
Our town, Halure...no, the Tree 
of Halure...grew this big by just 
accepting all that transpires. <PAGE>And I am sure it 
will continue to do so.

## POINTER 3633
I think the trick to living is 
to accept what comes, 
no matter what it may be.

## POINTER 3634
Something strange is going 
on. Many people are 
reporting feeling sick. <PAGE>Healers are running 
around everywhere.

## POINTER 3635
I feel fine today, but I 
felt terrible yesterday. <PAGE>I wonder how my 
body will feel tomorrow...

## POINTER 3636
So, I heard the Don died? 
It’s nonsense, if you ask me.<PAGE>So what if one of those big 
shots is dead? What’s the 
big deal, anyway?

## POINTER 3637
Someone younger is bound to
come along and take the Don’s place
and lead the Guilds anyway.<PAGE>I can’t be bothered with
something as trifle as this.

## POINTER 3638
Rumor has it that Alexei
has seized control of Zaphias.<PAGE>Well, I saw this day coming.

## POINTER 3639
While we’re on this topic,
I think that captain, Flynn
is pretty fishy too.<PAGE>I don’t know. Let’s just
say I’ve got a hunch for
these things...

## POINTER 3640
The Imperial Knight's captain
 <STR>(FRE) put refugees on ship
from Zaphias and headed south.<PAGE>I bet they're going to work those
guys down to the bones.

## POINTER 3641
What happens to the
people in Zaphias has
nothing to do with me!

## POINTER 3642
That hideous monster! It was
hovering above Aspio, wasn't it?
Did the mages put it there?

## POINTER 3643
I've always thought
those darn mages
were up to no good.

## POINTER 3644
That tower is close
to Aspio, right?<PAGE>Those mages must
be up to something.

## POINTER 3645
They must have revived
that tower for some reason.<PAGE>Just like how they monopolized the
blastia and got the Empire to back
them up. I don’t trust those guys.

## POINTER 3646
I don’t care who's plotting to
do what anymore.<PAGE>Either way, the Empire nor
the Guilds are going to do
anything for us.

## POINTER 3647
I bet someone built that tower out of
self-interest because they’ve got a score
to settle with the Empire or the Guilds.

## POINTER 3648
The skies cleared up...Those mermen
are roaming the sea whenever it’s sunny
at this time of the year.

## POINTER 3649
If it rains, we can’t go out to sea.
If it’s sunny, we've got those mermen
to deal with...*sigh*

## POINTER 3650
You know, I was a member
of the pirate guild, Siren’s Fang.<PAGE>Then the boss died, and everyone
went their own ways...

## POINTER 3651
You’ve never heard of Siren’s 
Fang? It was the guild of the 
king of the pirates, Aifread.

## POINTER 3652
An Imperial naval ship set
out for Nordopolica a little
while ago.<PAGE>At any rate, it’s tough for a guy
like me who’s just trying to make an
honest living to send a ship out to sea.

## POINTER 3653
So, Nordopolica has fallen
under the jurisdiction of the
Empire at last...<PAGE>I guess Dahngrest
will be next.

## POINTER 3654
Taking this many people
out to sea? This is way
over the capacity.<PAGE>I just hope we don’t sink...

## POINTER 3655
Those landlubbing knights!
Don't underestimate the sea!

## POINTER 3656
I heard a lot of sunken treasures
lie at the bottom of the ocean.<PAGE>I bet that palace on the
surface is no exception.

## POINTER 3657
But, all the attention from
the public takes away some
of it's mysterious aura...

## POINTER 3658
I heard there’s a shiny
new continent to the
northeast of here.<PAGE>I’d like to go if I can only
get a ship out to sea...

## POINTER 3659
A precursor to a volcanic eruption, maybe? 
Or perhaps the sea level dropped?<PAGE>This is why the seas are 
full of such romance!

## POINTER 3660
......<PAGE>The magistrate is sleeping.
So scram!

## POINTER 3661
I don't want to say
anything bad.

## POINTER 3662
......<PAGE>The magistrate is not in.
Get lost!

## POINTER 3663
You sure are pesky.
Who the heck are you?

## POINTER 3664
......<PAGE>The magistrate is very busy.
Go home.

## POINTER 3665
He's never going to meet
with someone the likes of you.

## POINTER 3666
......<PAGE>The magistrate is not here.
Now, get lost!

## POINTER 3667
Leave while you still can!
Now go!

## POINTER 3668
I’ve seen quite a few men
row off to sea in a boat...<PAGE>None of them has
been back since...

## POINTER 3669
Hmph! I bet they all found
themselves a nice girl in
a town somewhere!

## POINTER 3670
I have the smiles of 
many men tucked away 
in my memories...<PAGE>They all said I was 
such a lovely woman.

## POINTER 3671
...You can't see that?
Ugh. How rude!

## POINTER 3672
No real man is a coward!<PAGE>Who were those losers just now?
They were running off crying!

## POINTER 3673
A guy that can laugh in the
face of danger! Now that’s
the kind of man I like!<PAGE>What? Well, I’m still
on the market!

## POINTER 3674
Our research is falling behind
because Mordio is not here.

## POINTER 3675
Will you guys be
done soon?<PAGE>I need Mordio back to
help with the research.

## POINTER 3676
Yeager’s dead... What’s going 
to happen to Ruin’s Gate?<PAGE>I guess you don’t have
the answer to that...

## POINTER 3677
That still gives me
a reason to slack off...

## POINTER 3678
Everyone calm down.<PAGE>Nothing is going to threaten the
Empire as long as the barrier and
the knights are around.

## POINTER 3679
I'm going to take down that thing
in the sky with my own hands.

## POINTER 3680
I’ve been sent by Sir Flynn to
protect the safety of this town.
I shall fulfill my duty!

## POINTER 3681
We must really band together
in order to make sure we do
not embarrass Captain <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 3682
The <STR>(FRE) Brigade is great.
I would love to be a knight.<PAGE>It would be so fulfilling to
live such a righteous life.

## POINTER 3683
Hooray for the <STR>(FRE) Brigade!
Guess I shouldn't have quit
being a knight...

## POINTER 3684
We can just leave all
the troubles in the
world to <STR>(FRE).<PAGE>We’re going to
prevent it all!

## POINTER 3685
If we save the world, my name
will be part of history as a part of
the Twelve Spears of the <STR>(FRE) Brigade...<PAGE>Hee hee hee...

## POINTER 3686
You don't know of the famous
Twelve Spears of the <STR>(FRE) Brigade?<PAGE>There's Sir <STR>(FRE)'s trusty sword, Sodia.
Under that, the Three Swords.
Under that, the Six Lion Blades.<PAGE>The the Eight Martians and the Nine Sword-bearers.
Under that, the Ten Wings, and under them, the 
Ten Maces, the Eleven Halberds, the Eight Shots.<PAGE>And then,
under them is us,
the Twelve Spears!!<PAGE>What? You've never heard of us?!
You better study up
before you come back!

## POINTER 3687
As one of the Twelve Spears
of the <STR>(FRE) Brigade,
I will protect the peace in this town!

## POINTER 3688
......<PAGE>Scram!
There's no way I'm going
to let you through.

## POINTER 3689
I'm going to kill you if
you show your face in
front of me again,

## POINTER 3690
H-h-hi there...
W-w-w-we're even open 
at a t-t-time like this.

## POINTER 3691
Th-the Knights caught it, 
but this monster just suddenly starts moving,
 and I don't know what's going on...

## POINTER 3692
Why did my comrades assist 
in the rebellion...<PAGE>No matter how charismatic 
Commandant Alexei was, to do 
something like that is just...

## POINTER 3693
But you know, one wrong 
step and I might have followed 
Commandant Alexei too.

## POINTER 3694
I was in the Royal 
Guard at that time. <PAGE>I received an order, 
and I just followed 
out of blind loyalty.

## POINTER 3695
I fought with 
you as well. <PAGE>It is such a disgrace...

## POINTER 3696
Hmph... I say, I cannot abide 
relying on you to save us! 
I say, we will repay this debt!

## POINTER 3697
I say, Captain Schwann will 
replace that traitorous dog, 
Alexei, as Commandant!

## POINTER 3698
When Commandant Alexei took 
over the castle, I wasn't sure 
whether or not to follow him. <PAGE>Now I know I did the 
right thing by believing 
in Lieutenant Leblanc!

## POINTER 3699
...Still, I have to wonder 
what's in store for 
the Imperial Knights...<PAGE>And what will become of 
this glorious capital, my 
beloved Zaphias...?
