## POINTER 5600
They say the new moon turns 
the monsters used in the coliseum 
particularly fierce.<PAGE>So, as a precaution, Palestralle keeps 
an extra-sharp watch on their monsters, 
on nights before a new moon arrives.

## POINTER 5601
I happened to be in the coliseum right 
when the reverse barrier that contains 
the monsters went down.<PAGE>It was frightening, to be sure, but it 
happened when the moon ws full, so the 
monsters we actually quite subdued.

## POINTER 5602
You can be sure the people of this town 
are allowing the Knights to maintain 
a presence here only grudgingly.

## POINTER 5603
It turns out that this provisional Duce, 
Natz, was the one actually managing 
Palestralle's business affairs.<PAGE>Accordingly, Belius' death hasn't 
posed any real hindrances to the 
guild's financial operations.

## POINTER 5604
Belius was a crucial support to the 
morale of the town. The gravity of her 
loss should not be underestimated.

## POINTER 5605
The Knights are now without a Commandant, 
and what's more, their presence in each 
of the world's regions is faltering.<PAGE>It can't belong before control 
of Nordopolica is returned 
to Palestralle completely.

## POINTER 5606
Most likely something will need to be 
done about this monster in the sky before 
such a thing can happen, though.

## POINTER 5607
See that headless statue, there? Apparently, 
that's the patron goddess of warriors 
known as the "benevolent mother."<PAGE>It was built nearly 800 years ago, 
but the head was lost when a massive 
wave crashed against the town.

## POINTER 5608
Perhaps we too should pray before 
the goddess. For our own well-being, 
and for the peace of this world.

## POINTER 5609
Hey, hey. Why is 
that statue missing 
its face?<PAGE>Do you think maybe someone 
came and took it?

## POINTER 5610
Is it supposed to be a woman? If they 
made a statue of her, she must have 
been really pretty in real life.<PAGE>Aww. I wish somebody 
would make a 
statue of me.

## POINTER 5611
If you go out of the town and then go west, 
you'll find a cave called the Cados.<PAGE>Everybody tells me it's super 
dangerous, and that I should 
never go in there, though.

## POINTER 5612
When the wind blows through 
the cave, it sounds just like 
a whistle. Tweet, tweet.♪<PAGE>So it's also called the Cados 
Weasand, or something.

## POINTER 5613
The monsters got out at the coliseum. I guess 
the reverse barrier isn't very strong.<PAGE>I hope they don't come 
and get me while I'm 
sleeping at night...

## POINTER 5614
The barrier around the town keeps monsters 
out, but the reverse barrier got its name because 
it's used to keep monsters inside it.

## POINTER 5615
Are these Knights 
our enemies, or 
our friends?<PAGE>They beat up the monsters, 
but the grown-ups still 
don't look very happy.

## POINTER 5616
I for one hope they're 
our friends.<PAGE>I mean, it would 
be bad if we had this 
many enemies.

## POINTER 5617
Miss Belius died, but I'd never 
even seen her before so 
I'm not sure how to feel.<PAGE>With the Knights here now, at least it'll 
be peaceful for the time being, right?

## POINTER 5618
I also heard that a man 
named Don died, too.<PAGE>That's another person I'd 
never seen before. I wonder 
where he was from?

## POINTER 5619
I heard the grown-ups say that the 
whole world is in a big mess.<PAGE>But it's okay, because we'll 
all protect this town together. 
So, I'm not afraid at all!

## POINTER 5620
Actually, the sky's so high up there, 
that I can't really understand it.<PAGE>I wonder if that thing's 
really dangerous.

## POINTER 5621
No moon in the sky... 
and the new moon...
I get the feeling something’s going to happen.<PAGE>Though a premonition is nothing more than that, 
I’m sure feeling a mixture of anxiety and hope...

## POINTER 5622
It seems that Belius only 
meets people at the new moon.<PAGE>Maybe I should 
visit her later...

## POINTER 5623
I can't believe Duce Belius 
is dead... We were supposed to meet 
and have all manner of discussions.<PAGE>What an unfortunate twist of fate. 
It was such a promising chance...

## POINTER 5624
This must be a message from the heavens: 
"Go and discover the origin of the Kritya"...

## POINTER 5625
I've had Lord Natz
arrange for me to work at 
the coliseum's library.<PAGE>It's quite befitting a city of such history. 
There are enough books there to 
satisfy any Kritya's thirst for knowledge.

## POINTER 5626
I may even be able to 
discover our origins without 
ever having to go beyond those mountains.

## POINTER 5627
I once saw an image that 
looked very much like that 
ominous shadow in the sky.<PAGE>It must have been in one of the 
books in my parents' room, 
when I was very young...

## POINTER 5628
I get the feeling we 
Kritya somehow have a very 
deep connection to that beast in the sky...

## POINTER 5629
Long ago, the clans of old and 
the human ruling class stood in partnership, 
united through Kritya mediation.<PAGE>This may finally 
be our time to stand up.

## POINTER 5630
Yes, I remember now. 
It was in a passage in one 
of my parents' books.<PAGE>Be it lies or truth, 
I believe this is a duty 
assigned to our people.

## POINTER 5631
An accident has occurred within 
the coliseum, and we are in the 
process of attending to it.<PAGE>It is our sworn duty to defend all towns 
that lay within reach of the empire.

## POINTER 5632
We will assure the safety 
of this town.

## POINTER 5633
It is possible that a number of the monsters 
have escaped to the residential 
district, and remain there still.<PAGE>We will stay until we can be completely 
sure of the town's safety.

## POINTER 5634
The people of this town seem 
to chafe at our presence, but 
we must fulfill our duty.<PAGE>If they choose not to accept us, well 
that is ultimately not our concern.

## POINTER 5635
No matter how the townspeople may 
feel, we must stand by our posts 
until our work here is finished.

## POINTER 5636
We have our duties to perform. Whatever 
may be happening in the sky can 
not sway us from that task.

## POINTER 5637
If anything should threaten the order 
of this town, we must apply the full 
measure of our force against it.

## POINTER 5638
The other day, an old 
woman left some steamed 
buns with us.<PAGE>They were piping-hot and actually 
quite delicious...

## POINTER 5639
Thankfully, not many people are out and about at 
night... At least then I can be free from the scorn 
their eyes show whenever they look at us...<PAGE>I can understand that they weren't 
overjoyed to see us, but...this 
hurts a little...

## POINTER 5640
We came here for what we understood 
to be the cause of good...

## POINTER 5641
A citizen threw a rock at 
me... Then he dared me to 
try and arrest him...<PAGE>I wish it were that 
simple for me, you 
know, emotionally.

## POINTER 5642
Maybe I'm just not cut out 
to be a Knight after all.<PAGE>It might be time to start looking for another job...

## POINTER 5643
Captain Schwann is far too busy... 
*Mumble, mumble...* So the Lieutenant 
does his job... Oh...<PAGE>Zzz... Sir 
Leblanc...

## POINTER 5644
Any suspicious behavior from you... 
*Mumble, mumble...* And I'll take
you into custody...

## POINTER 5645
We've come here... *Mumble, mumble...* 
to assist the 
<STR>(FRE) Brigade... <PAGE>Zzz... Ooh, you're 
under arrest...

## POINTER 5646
As long as we d-d-do our best... 
*Mumble, mumble...* Everyone 
will be happy...

## POINTER 5647
Late night visitors, I see.
Welcome to Nordopolica's
hotel facility.<PAGE>The cost is 500 Gald per night. 
Will you be staying with us?

## POINTER 5648
Thank you very much.<PAGE>Please enjoy your stay.

## POINTER 5649
A few days ago, 
a few suspicious looking 
characters arrived at the inn.<PAGE>Those guys are knights, weren’t they? 
They just left, 
wearing knight’s armor.

## POINTER 5650
Why have they come 
to this town?<PAGE>They were standing around town 
wearing normal clothes, they 
tricked us the swine!

## POINTER 5651
If the guys that stayed 
here were knights, I should 
have set up a little tourist-trap...

## POINTER 5652
Thank you very much.
Hope to see you again.

## POINTER 5653
Welcome to you. This shop is directly 
affiliated with Fortune's Market.<PAGE>Whether you're on a long journey, or just 
a trip to the coliseum, we have the items 
to satisfy all your shopping needs!

## POINTER 5654
Hey, got any need for items? I've been 
approved by Fortune's Market itself. 
Let me know what you I can get you.

## POINTER 5655
Appreciate it, pal. 
Come back anytime.

## POINTER 5656
Hey there, how about taking a 
look? My shop's been approved 
by Fortune's Market itself.<PAGE>Thanks, bud. Stop 
by anytime.

## POINTER 5657
We welcome browsers, too. My shop's been 
approved by Fortune's Market itself. 
You go ahead and look all you like.<PAGE>Always a pleasure. 
Come back anytime.

## POINTER 5658
Welcome! We're the coliseum city's 
official store. You'll find everything 
you need right here.

## POINTER 5659
We hope you'll come 
see us again.

## POINTER 5660
The empire claims a history of roughly eight 
centuries, but this town far exceeds that, 
having been founded some 1200 years ago.<PAGE>And to think that it all began with the 
stone slabs of the original coliseum.

## POINTER 5661
If you head from here for twenty or thirty kilometers 
in a westerly direction,you will hit a high and steep mountain range 
known to us as the Mother Cados mountains.<PAGE>It's quite a meaningful name, 
but it's only used by 
this town's folk.

## POINTER 5662
Once you have passed the Mother Cados mountains, 
you will hit the Sands of Kogorh, but you’re going to need some serious 
preparations before getting over those mountains!

## POINTER 5663
The Knights went rushing into 
the coliseum for some reason...<PAGE>It would seem that something 
quite serious is happening.

## POINTER 5664
This city is truly fascinating...as much for its historical value as it 
is for being the gathering place of so many rough-and-tumble types.<PAGE>It seems like such a dichotomy, but 
the two unite here in Nordopolica.

## POINTER 5665
It is for the best that the 
Knights are here to maintain 
order in the town.<PAGE>I'm not certain I feel the same way 
about that battleship, though.

## POINTER 5666
Duce Belius has passed away... 
Now is the time for mourning.<PAGE>The death of a person is a great loss. 
It is also a rite of passage for 
those of us who remain behind.

## POINTER 5667
Death is one thing we 
cannot simply pretend 
has not occurred.<PAGE>The coming weeks will be a time 
of trial for this town.

## POINTER 5668
If that abomination were to attack this 
city with its full strength, I doubt 
the barrier would be of any help.<PAGE>Could this be the end 
times for humanity...?

## POINTER 5669
I've got a friend who moved to the 
residential district here, and 
I've come to pay him a visit.<PAGE>For whatever reason though, 
they won't let me in...

## POINTER 5670
Just when I thought I'd finally get to 
meet my friend, I'm told the place is 
closed to anyone who's not a resident.<PAGE>Do I seriously have to spend 
another night in the inn?

## POINTER 5671
It's not like I'm made of money, or something. I've 
gotta save enough for my passage back to the capital. 
Man, nothing ever goes the way you think it will...

## POINTER 5672
Those Knights are surprisingly stingy. I 
asked one of them to loan me some Gald seeing 
as I'm broke, and he wouldn't do it.<PAGE>I thought the Knights were 
supposed to help the people 
in their times of need.

## POINTER 5673
I mean, at least they could 
stand to give a guy enough 
for a bite to eat.

## POINTER 5674
That battleship's gonna be headed back 
to the capital sooner or later, right?<PAGE>So why can't they give 
me a ride for at least 
part of the way, then?

## POINTER 5675
Those nights are surprisingly... Forget 
it, I'm done being surprised. They're 
just straight-up stingy.

## POINTER 5676
Here they're dealing with the death of Belius, 
and in Dahngrest it's the death of the Don.<PAGE>If I had to guess, I'd say that the 
Commandant of the Knights'll be the 
next one to have his ticket punched.

## POINTER 5677
But if all three of them 
were to die, who'd be 
left to run this world?<PAGE>We'd really be in a bind 
if that happened...

## POINTER 5678
So the monster in the sky is 
hovering over Ilyccia, huh?<PAGE>Man, I'm so glad I came to this town... 
And that I was too broke to go home.

## POINTER 5679
It's not like I can just stay here forever, 
though... My friend's being a real 
jerk anyway. Tough breaks, huh...?

## POINTER 5680
First we get that freaky monster, and 
then up comes this massive tower.<PAGE>Just what's the deal, here? Is 
this world gonna be all right?

## POINTER 5681
Man, my head feels like it's full of rocks. 
I can't keep up with all this stuff.

## POINTER 5682
This is the world's one and only coliseum. 
There's plenty of folks who come from far 
and wide just to catch a glimpse of it.<PAGE>You look like you've come a pretty long way yourselves. 
'Course anybody could tell that, seein' as 
you're lookin' a bit on the scruffy side.

## POINTER 5683
Why are there 
Knights in this town?<PAGE>If we leave it as it is, the discipline
we worked hard to build in the
coliseum will collapse!

## POINTER 5684
In this town, we've worked things out so that 
the guild Palestralle stands on equal footing 
with the regular folks that live here.<PAGE>We're not into that absolute government 
stuff they force on people 
in the imperial capital.

## POINTER 5685
On a night with no moon, 
it’s darker than usual, 
makes me feel uneasy.<PAGE>The monsters are getting restless, 
and I’m getting more and 
more uneasy...

## POINTER 5686
This may be an uneasy night, 
but this town should be defended 
by the Guildsmen of Palestralle.<PAGE>We don’t need 
the Knight’s help.

## POINTER 5687
Those schemin' Knights. They say they're 
here to provide security, but I know 
it's their plan to take over.<PAGE>Belius would never stand 
for such tyranny...

## POINTER 5688
But Belius has gone 
and left us behind...

## POINTER 5689
I'm a member of Palestralle, the 
guild that governs this city.<PAGE>I'm on patrol tonight, 
as usual.

## POINTER 5690
If I spot anyone actin' 
fishy, I sentence them to 
a swift butt kicking.

## POINTER 5691
What’s that? 
Some Knights are heading 
to the coliseum?<PAGE>Lurking like thieves in the night! 
Hiding here all along!

## POINTER 5692
Huh? It's... It's not a guy? 
It's a place? Like a city? <PAGE>So bring 'em all on! All of 
us in Palestralle will rip 
every last one of 'em apart

## POINTER 5693
What’s that? 
Some Knights are heading 
to the coliseum?<PAGE>They must have 
snuck in under the 
cover of darkness!

## POINTER 5694
What happened?
What are all these
knights doing here?!

## POINTER 5695
So they've finally gone and done 
it, huh? Those Union dogs...<PAGE>That Don had been waitin' 
for his chance to take out 
the Duce all along!

## POINTER 5696
We can take on
these monsters if
we joined forces.

## POINTER 5697
Heh heh. That's right, man. 
I live in this town.<PAGE>Neat, huh? Pretty amazing, 
right? It's okay 
to be jealous.

## POINTER 5698
Someday, I'm gonna be as strong 
as that guy Kratos, and I'll 
be a hero of the tournaments.<PAGE>Not even you guys could 
beat Kratos. He's the 
toughest in the world!

## POINTER 5699
Yeah! Woo hoo! The champion 
of the coliseum is 
totally awesome!<PAGE>I heard his name's 
<STR>(FRE)! Knights 
are so cool!
