## POINTER 4400
We can't keep doing this... 
We have to prepare for 
the monsters' night attacks...

## POINTER 4401
The fleeting blossoms of a heart 
yearning for tomorrow. The midnight 
storm that fails to blow...

## POINTER 4402
Morning's for thinking, Day's 
for action. Evening's for eating. 
Night's for sleeping. <PAGE>It may sound plain, 
but this sort of life 
makes me the most happy.

## POINTER 4403
Back then, I wished so many 
times that I had died... <PAGE>But I don't think that now.

## POINTER 4404
I cannot die until I've repaid my 
debt to the people here. They gave 
me hope when all hope was lost. <PAGE>Repaying their kindness 
will probably take the 
rest of my life.

## POINTER 4405
The Tree of Halure is also 
quite beautiful at night.

## POINTER 4406
When winter has come, 
spring will follow after... <PAGE>When night has fallen, 
a new day soon will dawn...

## POINTER 4407
How could the Tree have 
come back to life?!

## POINTER 4408
A dead tree blooming again... 
I've never seen that 
in my entire life...

## POINTER 4409
When the faint white of the Halure
blossoms illuminate the darkness 
of the night, I feel at peace.

## POINTER 4410
I dislike noise, but I 
dislike living without a sense 
of security even more. <PAGE>I'd especially like to 
have it quiet at night.

## POINTER 4411
Some people get so loud when 
they view the blosoms at night. 
I can't stand them.

## POINTER 4412
Hey! Listen! 
The Tree of Halure came 
back to life!

## POINTER 4413
Hey, mister, how did the 
Tree come back to life?

## POINTER 4414
Hey! Listen! 
The Imperial Knights 
came to town!

## POINTER 4415
Hey! Listen! 
There was some big 
trouble in Dahngrest!

## POINTER 4416
We're going to 
drink all night long!

## POINTER 4417
We're going again to 
gaze at Halure tonight. 
This is our fifth night!

## POINTER 4418
We're drinking 
again tonight!

## POINTER 4419
Drinking morning and night while 
flower viewing... I'm way past 
just relaxing under the flowers...

## POINTER 4420
Being able to sleep peacefully 
at night is no small thing.

## POINTER 4421
Do you think the Knights will 
post guards at night as well?

## POINTER 4422
If they did, 
our defense certainly 
would be tough.

## POINTER 4423
I don't know who defeated 
the monster... But, we're 
safe at night.

## POINTER 4424
Time is something that can 
turn to gold or lead depending 
on how you use it. <PAGE>Just like a night drinking will 
turn out very differntly than 
a quiet evening with a book.

## POINTER 4425
The Tree of Halure is constantly 
growing ever so slightly larger.

## POINTER 4426
The best time for pondering the 
events of one's life is at night.

## POINTER 4427
The dark of night finally becomes morning. 
The rising sun will eventually sink, 
and night will fall again.<PAGE>Don't you think this cycle 
resembles life itself?

## POINTER 4428
If one wishes for happiness 
today, they need gaze only upon 
the blossoms of Halure.<PAGE>However, if one desires a lifetime 
of happiness, they must care 
deeply for the Tree of Halure.

## POINTER 4429
It's nights like this 
that I recall all the old sayings 
we have here in Halure.

## POINTER 4430
The Tree of Halure is 
back in gorgeous bloom.

## POINTER 4431
I wonder what we can do 
to stop it from ever 
withering again?

## POINTER 4432
The Imperial Knights 
came from Zaphias.

## POINTER 4433
I wish they would just 
leave this town alone.

## POINTER 4434
Making a friend of 
time enriches one's life.<PAGE>Do you know what 
that saying means?

## POINTER 4435
Plant good seeds, water and 
fertilize them well, and keep 
weeds and insects away...<PAGE>...But the most important thing 
of all is to wait patiently. 
It's that simple.

## POINTER 4436
I guess we're not 
that different!

## POINTER 4437
I don't want to die. But... <PAGE>If I'm going die sometime, 
I want to be okay with it.

## POINTER 4438
The reason this town is 
safe is because of the blastia.

## POINTER 4439
There is no end to research. <PAGE>You finish researching one 
thing, and there's something 
else waiting to be studied.

## POINTER 4440
Sure, you can see the 
flowers of Halure with 
your eyes, but... <PAGE>It'd be wonderful to feel 
the flowers with your heart...

## POINTER 4441
We pray to the Tree 
of Halure before 
we go to sleep. <PAGE>We always thank it for 
keeping us safe today...

## POINTER 4442
I wonder how many 
long years the Tree 
of Halure has endured?

## POINTER 4443
We don't realize the 
value of everyday things 
until they're lost.

## POINTER 4444
We had taken the Tree of Halure
for granted. But now, we must 
be more thankful for it.

## POINTER 4445
I'm so relieved the 
blastia was repaired.

## POINTER 4446
The people of this town 
care for the Tree deeply.

## POINTER 4447
It may be a blastia, but that 
doesn't mean it's permanent.

## POINTER 4448
I ask you folk to care 
for the Tree as well.

## POINTER 4449
In this town, there is not 
a single person who does not 
care for the Tree of Halure.

## POINTER 4450
To us, the Tree is as an 
umbrella on a rainy day.

## POINTER 4451
If you follow the hill 
up, you'll arrive 
at the Tree of Halure.<PAGE>Of course, it's dead now...

## POINTER 4452
If you follow the hill 
up, you'll arrive 
at the Tree of Halure.<PAGE>It has been restored 
to beautiful life!

## POINTER 4453
If you follow the 
hill up, you'll arrive 
at the Tree of Halure.<PAGE>Three types of flowers 
bloom upon it...oh, do you 
already know about them?

## POINTER 4454
The harmonea flower, 
the luluria flower, and 
the renen flower. <PAGE>Those are the three.

## POINTER 4455
Even the mighty Tree 
of Halure isn't immortal.

## POINTER 4456
We're all the same. 
We're all alive.

## POINTER 4457
There are no 
guarantees in life...

## POINTER 4458
That's the only 
real guarantee!

## POINTER 4459
Halure will remain at 
peace as long as the 
flowers continue to bloom.

## POINTER 4460
Every morning upon rising, 
I go to pray at the 
Tree of Halure.<PAGE>"Please keep us 
safe today," I ask...

## POINTER 4461
But the Tree of 
Halure endures it all, 
in infinite patience.

## POINTER 4462
It hurts, "I'm tired", 
"I've had enough" ...You'll 
never save anyone that way.

## POINTER 4463
Thankfully, the Tree of 
Halure does that for us.

## POINTER 4464
Grandpa says the Tree 
of Halure was around even 
when he was a little boy...

## POINTER 4465
I wonder how long 
the Tree's been here?

## POINTER 4466
A bunch of dirty 
people came to town.<PAGE>Is that what 
they call "refugees"?

## POINTER 4467
I wish they'd 
all just leave.

## POINTER 4468
I think the flowers are beautiful 
because they bloom with every 
last ounce of their strength.

## POINTER 4469
I hope I can be as 
beautiful as these 
flowers some day.

## POINTER 4470
I think the flowers are so 
beautiful because they're silent.

## POINTER 4471
I wish people could 
be the same way...

## POINTER 4472
Our town, Halure...no, the Tree of Halure
grew as large as it did by 
simply accepting all that transpires.<PAGE>And I am sure it will 
continue to do so.

## POINTER 4473
Are you afraid of 
being hurt? So am I.<PAGE>But look at the Tree of 
Halure...can't you feel something?

## POINTER 4474
Squirrels may gnaw at its 
buds and insects may 
chew off its leaves...<PAGE>Yet through it all, the 
Tree still manages to produce 
such wonderful flowers.

## POINTER 4475
What happened here 
will surely happen countless 
times again.

## POINTER 4476
As long as man's true 
nature remains the <PAGE>same, this will all reoccur.
The greatest opposition to man's 
reasoning is always his nature.

## POINTER 4477
Don't get all happy when 
your luck's good, and don't 
get all down when it's bad.

## POINTER 4478
Tomorrow's flowers 
will bloom tomorrow...

## POINTER 4479
Nothing so simple as 
fate ruins our lives.

## POINTER 4480
We always ruin our own.

## POINTER 4481
This is the town of Myorzo. 
Only Kritya live here, but we 
welcome guests from outside.

## POINTER 4482
It has been some time since 
we last had human visitors.

## POINTER 4483
You people came from outside, 
didn't you? I could tell right away. 
I know everybody in this town.

## POINTER 4484
Hey, hey, people from outside...
Do something interesting!

## POINTER 4485
Well, if it isn't <STR>(JUD)! 
It's been a while! 
How are you?

## POINTER 4486
How many years has it been 
since you've been back in 
Myorzo? Not that it matters.

## POINTER 4487
The monster in the sky isn't the 
same one on the ancient relief 
we have here in Myorzo, is it?

## POINTER 4488
Myorzo is protected by an 
Entelexeia. We'll be safe 
no matter what happens.

## POINTER 4489
I-I'm not scared 
of that thing! 
Hmph!

## POINTER 4490
We're not gonna be eaten 
by that monster, right?

## POINTER 4491
I can't believe the image 
of the Adephagos on our 
relief became reality...

## POINTER 4492
Should we Kritya 
just stay hiding 
inside Myorzo?

## POINTER 4493
Welcome to Myorzo. 
Things certainly seem 
tumultuous outside.

## POINTER 4494
Of course, it doesn't 
have anything to do 
with us living here.

## POINTER 4495
There's such a commotion 
outside. Do something 
about it. Please.

## POINTER 4496
This is just my opinion, but the 
giant building that erupted from 
the ground is very suspicious.

## POINTER 4497
There's nothing in any of 
our lore that mentions 
such a massive construction.

## POINTER 4498
There must be something 
we can do, too.

## POINTER 4499
Well, well... 
So you're the humans? 
It's nice to meet you.
