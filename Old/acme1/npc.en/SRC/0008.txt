## POINTER 800
I heard there's a 
different road that'll 
take you close to Halure. <PAGE>Unfortunately, I don't 
know where that road is.

## POINTER 801
I can't wait to get 
to Halure and do a 
little flower viewing. <PAGE>A nice drink in the shade of 
the Tree of Halure makes all 
the dangerous travel worth it.

## POINTER 802
Going around outside the 
barriers was pretty unusual 
up until a few years ago.<PAGE>There have been more travelers 
recently, but most people are still 
too scared to leave their towns.

## POINTER 803
With the Hold closed, there's 
no way to get to Halure.

## POINTER 804
Even the Lord of the 
Plains can't get through 
the Hold, so don't worry.

## POINTER 805
Think about how many people never 
go outside the barriers... I'm so 
glad my work takes me places. <PAGE>Me? I'm on my way to 
deliver goods from 
Zaphias to Halure.

## POINTER 806
Deidon Hold was 
originally an outpost 
to defend the capital.<PAGE>But it makes a great place 
for us to rest, too.

## POINTER 807
I'll probably have to rethink 
my plans, with the Lord 
of the Plains and all...

## POINTER 808
This is bad. I wonder 
if I'll be stuck here 
until next season.

## POINTER 809
This reserve of 
provisions is for the use 
of the border guards. <PAGE>I'm very sorry, 
but I can't let you 
have any.

## POINTER 810
If you need provisions, 
please talk to the traveling 
merchants outside. <PAGE>I'm sure they'd be happy 
to sell you a variety of 
things from their cargo.

## POINTER 811
Our duty is to provide safe, 
smooth passage for travelers 
coming and going to Zaphias.

## POINTER 812
Deidon Hold is the 
very definition of 
tranquility today.

## POINTER 813
I hear young <STR>(FRE) has 
been made captain. 
I must do my best as well.

## POINTER 814
We haven't had any word 
from Zaphias lately. 
I wonder what's going on?

## POINTER 815
Rumor has it 
that Heracles
smashed into Zaphias. <PAGE>I wonder if the 
city is safe.

## POINTER 816
I'm performing my duty as a knight 
to protect Zaphias, but...is 
guarding the Hold really enough?

## POINTER 817
I've heard some sort of amazing 
building emerged from the sea. 
What could it be?

## POINTER 818
What does being a knight truly 
mean? Keeping watch here at the 
Hold, staring at that strange sky?

## POINTER 819
No news reaches 
us all the way out here.

## POINTER 820
They say <STR>(FRE) rescued the people 
that escaped Zaphias. He's the 
pride of the Imperial Knights.

## POINTER 821
I'll just do whatever 
I can to help.

## POINTER 822
This station is 
for guards only.<PAGE>All unauthorized 
personnel must refrain 
from entry.

## POINTER 823
You are strictly advised 
not to ascend the stairs 
to the rear. <PAGE>Please refrain from setting 
foot on the upper level 
of the ramparts.

## POINTER 824
Unauthorized personnel 
are prohibited from 
entering the guardhouse.

## POINTER 825
You are strictly 
advised not to ascend 
the stairs to the rear.

## POINTER 826
You are strictly 
advised not to ascend 
the stairs to the rear.<PAGE>It's dangerous.

## POINTER 827
We shall ensure the 
safety of the citizenry.<PAGE>We will not allow 
even one single person 
to come to danger.

## POINTER 828
Right now we have to 
concentrate all our efforts 
on defeating the monsters.

## POINTER 829
Everyone has just 
barely managed to 
escaped with their lives!<PAGE>We knights must 
protect those who 
have escaped with us!

## POINTER 830
I don't understand this... 
I used to have such a strong 
sense of purpose inside me...

## POINTER 831
I wonder how long 
we'll be here...<PAGE>Regardless, we urgently 
need to make temporary 
living arrangements.

## POINTER 832
Even then, 
we don't have enough 
supplies or people.<PAGE>But we have to 
do something...

## POINTER 833
There's no barrier blastia? 
All right. This is when we Imperial 
Knights show what we can do!<PAGE>So relax, and 
leave it to us...

## POINTER 834
The fact that we've somehow 
managed to live inside the 
barrier this far is proof of that.

## POINTER 835
Look, I'm glad we survived... 
But what are we supposed 
to do in this place?

## POINTER 836
I want to get back 
to Zaphias as 
soon as possible.

## POINTER 837
This is clearly no 
time for business.

## POINTER 838
I handed everything useful 
I had over to the Knights.

## POINTER 839
They say home is where the 
heart is, right? You can live 
no matter where you are.<PAGE>It was pretty bad 
when I was in Zaphias. 
It's no different here.

## POINTER 840
I wonder if the merchants 
could synthesize some tents...?

## POINTER 841
How long do we have to stay in 
a place without a barrier like this?<PAGE>I'm scared! I'm scared, 
I tell ya! I just know 
the monsters will come...

## POINTER 842
Ahh... 
How come these two 
are so easygoing...

## POINTER 843
This place is great; there's 
so much nature. But there's 
still the danger of the monsters.<PAGE>People are part of the food 
chain, so there's nothing 
we can do if we're eaten.

## POINTER 844
Ah! I love this! 
Enjoy adversity; 
it enlightens us.

## POINTER 845
Hey, mister... 
When do we get to 
go home?

## POINTER 846
I want to go home. 
I'm going by myself...

## POINTER 847
So, now the problem is: 
What will happen to 
us here on out?

## POINTER 848
And the answer 
is probably, 
"Who knows?"

## POINTER 849
Ugh... Owww...
...No, really, I'm fine.<PAGE>It's just a little cut...
Urgh!
Ohh, that hurts...

## POINTER 850
Ow ow ow...
I'm just glad 
I didn't die.

## POINTER 851
I'm so tired from 
running away...<PAGE>And on top of everything, 
some monster bit me hard...

## POINTER 852
My legs hurts a 
little, but I'm fine.<PAGE>People here will 
just laugh at you 
if you start whining.

## POINTER 853
No matter what, 
I'm gonna protect her.<PAGE>That's what this 
experience has 
made me decide.

## POINTER 854
If there's any food left over, 
even just a little, I'm giving it 
all to her. I don't care if I die.

## POINTER 855
It's nice to be thought 
of as important...<PAGE>But this guy's so 
serious it's scary!

## POINTER 856
And he doesn't even seem 
to mind acting like my shield. 
So I can't be mean to him...

## POINTER 857
Grrr.... 
This lady's always whining! 
It's so annoying!<PAGE>Oh, I mean, she's my wife, 
so it's okay, I just...

## POINTER 858
I wish she could just deal with stuff...<PAGE>I mean, I got a cut on my 
side that hurst like crazy, 
but am I whining? No.

## POINTER 859
It hurts!
I'm hungry!
I'm gonna die!<PAGE>I can't stand it
Owww!
I HATE THIS!

## POINTER 860
I broke a bone. I know it. 
I broke something. 
Well, at least a fracture...!

## POINTER 861
Not bad, huh? 
Almost looks like 
a real town now.

## POINTER 862
It's a start, at least.

## POINTER 863
Dummy: 
Please enter a message Ver2

## POINTER 864
We've built fences
and houses... Almost
looks like a real town now.

## POINTER 865
These are critical times. 
Supplying goods, establishing 
autonomy... So much work to do.

## POINTER 866
I can't talk!

## POINTER 867
A blastia was unearthed 
during the development 
of this town.<PAGE>But it won't work because there's 
no core and it's broken. It'll 
make a perfect monument, though.

## POINTER 868
Even though it doesn't work, 
this blastia can offer a sense of 
security as a symbol of the town.

## POINTER 869
I was headed for Torim, 
but <STR>(FRE) ordered 
me here!<PAGE>I hope to meet all of the 
citizens and be remembered!

## POINTER 870
I hope even those who aren't 
citizens will work with us. 
Let's build this town together!

## POINTER 871
It's nicer living here 
than it was in the 
lower quarter.

## POINTER 872
I wondered how it would turn out, 
but I can't imagine any reason 
to go back to Zaphias.

## POINTER 873
The central basin of the island 
in the middle of the Surion Archipelago 
northwest of here was underwater.<PAGE>I don't know how, 
but they say the water 
is no longer there.

## POINTER 874
The Land Under Water... 
It sounds kind of 
like a romantic tale.

## POINTER 875
We've built a better town 
than I had imagined.<PAGE>With this, I bet we can 
have a better life than 
in the lower quarter.â™ª

## POINTER 876
It's a little dangerous, 
but don't you think this 
new life is pretty nice?

## POINTER 877
What will become 
of this world 
if we have no blastia?<PAGE>Hmm...

## POINTER 878
Oh well... I tried to think 
about a world without blastia... 
But I just can't imagine it.

## POINTER 879
This is awful! 
No way! 
A town without a barrier...<PAGE>What good 
are blastia 
that don't work?

## POINTER 880
Look at the sky. 
That monster 
never stays still!

## POINTER 881
This is awful! 
How will we live 
without a barrier?<PAGE>But if His Highness 
tells us to do it, 
I guess we have to...

## POINTER 882
I don't wanna get 
fired for not obeying 
the emperor's orders!

## POINTER 883
I helped out a little 
with building houses.

## POINTER 884
The master carpenter 
said I was a natural!

## POINTER 885
This is both a hospital and just 
a place to rest! Why not spend 
the night? It's only 100 Gald.

## POINTER 886
Stop by any time...

## POINTER 887
We made a home 
here in this town. 
We can go home anytime.

## POINTER 888
I'm going home 
by myself...

## POINTER 889
People power is nothing 
to make light of... We built 
this town in no time!

## POINTER 890
I want to help... 
but, y'know, I'm 
pretty incompetent...

## POINTER 891
His Highness Ioder announced 
that he would kill that 
monster with the blastia core.<PAGE>I hope I can help with that 
to make up for not being able 
to help with building the town.

## POINTER 892
Luckily, I'm studying the blastia, so 
I think we need to consider what to 
do after there are no more left.

## POINTER 893
I suppose taking the first 
step always begins from 
nothing, just like this.

## POINTER 894
To think I would reach this 
ripe old age before realizing 
how truly blessed I was...

## POINTER 895
This tent is something 
I put up for my girl 
all by myself.<PAGE>I asked the architect 
guild how to do it.

## POINTER 896
A tent, just for her... 
Now that's true love...

## POINTER 897
Hey, what do you think? 
Take a look. Turned into 
quite a town, hasn't it?

## POINTER 898
Now we have to protect 
it with our lives.

## POINTER 899
East, clear! West, clear! 
North, clear! South, clear! 
No monsters in sight!
