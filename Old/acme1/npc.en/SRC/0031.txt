## POINTER 3100
Nothing is impossible! <PAGE>I stand where I am today 
because I believe in the 
power of those words.

## POINTER 3101
Yesterday, today, tomorrow. I'll never 
cease to do what I believe in.

## POINTER 3102
A knight makes loyal valor his guiding 
principle! To see a just cause and 
to not act is to lack bravery!

## POINTER 3103
I have nothing to fear from 
any concievable enemy!<PAGE>Be it dragons, be it monsters, 
come and get me!

## POINTER 3104
Construction starts
from this point on.<PAGE>If all goes according to plan,
this will be an admirable 
civic center in 4 months.

## POINTER 3105
How tepid... 4 months...
Just crack the whip and...<PAGE>...Um...
Never mind...

## POINTER 3106
Stop complaining 
and work.<PAGE>You want to be a noble, don't you?

## POINTER 3107
Depending on how well you perform, 
I might consider putting in a good 
word with Sir Cumore for you.

## POINTER 3108
The sound of blastia?
It's nothing.<PAGE>Don't waste a Knight's time
with trivial matters.

## POINTER 3109
You waste my time again
and I'll cut you into
little pieces.

## POINTER 3110
Losing control of the blastia and 
issues regarding our management
are two different things.<PAGE>The blastia just
ran out of control.

## POINTER 3111
Keep bugging me
and I'll have you all
dragged behind a chariot.

## POINTER 3112
Oh, it's been so quiet
without Lieutenant <STR>(FRE)
and the Schwann Brigade.<PAGE>The ruler of this city
is our own Cumore Brigade!

## POINTER 3113
You have something to say?
If you do,
I'm willing to listen.<PAGE>After that,
I'll interrogate you
in the dungeons.

## POINTER 3114
The deceiver always stays ten, 
a hundred steps ahead...

## POINTER 3115
But the honest man, taking one step 
at a time, is never rewarded...

## POINTER 3116
They say someone's 
going crazy in there. <PAGE>Me? No way. I'm not 
getting myself 
hurt over this.

## POINTER 3117
Let the others do 
the dirty work.<PAGE>It's not worth getting 
injured over.

## POINTER 3118
You guys got
into the compound?<PAGE>Are you stupid?
You're asking to get hurt.

## POINTER 3119
Who was acting
up in there?<PAGE>He must have cracked
under all that stress.

## POINTER 3120
You'll need permission 
to use the elevator.<PAGE>I can't let anyone without 
clearance through.

## POINTER 3121
No matter what the situation, I 
can't let you ride this elevator.

## POINTER 3122
The crisis may have been averted, but I 
still can't let you ride this elevator.

## POINTER 3123
You're persistent. 
I'll give you that...<PAGE>...but persistence isn't getting 
you on this elevator!

## POINTER 3124
You want on the elevator? Go ahead.

## POINTER 3125
You're persistent...
Do you know what
"secure area" means?

## POINTER 3126
The strong do not win. It is 
the winners who are strong.

## POINTER 3127
Victory is meaningless unless 
you are victorious at all things!

## POINTER 3128
Victory is unattainable without striding 
towards it, fully aware of the dangers.

## POINTER 3129
That first stride 
will soon become the 
road you travel.

## POINTER 3130
When the blastia lost 
control, not one Knight 
took action...<PAGE>That's a personal defeat...

## POINTER 3131
A knight must never speak, even 
should he be reduced to bones.

## POINTER 3132
It is said people learn more 
from failure than victory...<PAGE>Perhaps. But only if you manage 
to survive your failure!

## POINTER 3133
In the battles of knights, 
failure often means death.<PAGE>There's simply no time for 
leisurely conversation.

## POINTER 3134
The Cumore Brigade has joined 
us as reserve troops, but...<PAGE>...I can't abide by their 
domineering ways!

## POINTER 3135
They're no different than 
common barbarians!<PAGE>Knights should be taking pride 
in their military discipline...

## POINTER 3136
Don't speak of ideals, 
become them.<PAGE>Words of a famous man. 
I forgot who, though...

## POINTER 3137
No matter what the weather may 
bring, you must always exert every 
last drop of your might.

## POINTER 3138
This may very well be a crisis situation, 
but it's too early to give up hope.<PAGE>Why? Because we are struggling against this 
adversity together, with all of our might.

## POINTER 3139
Won't you lend us your might, as well?

## POINTER 3140
For the people, and 
for the world.<PAGE>Keep the reasons you're 
struggling with all your might firmly 
in mind, and anything is possible.

## POINTER 3141
For now, we must 
devote all our might 
to what we can.

## POINTER 3142
Do you know why I'm so particular 
about struggling with all my might?<PAGE>Life is simply too short 
to accomplish anything.

## POINTER 3143
Please make sure you never find 
yourself idly whiling your days 
away on trivial matters.

## POINTER 3144
Are ideals just that,
simply ideals?<PAGE>The people got tired
and left the city...

## POINTER 3145
The people's hearts were worn
after laboring day after day
so they left.<PAGE>And now look at this city.

## POINTER 3146
Monitoring the laborers 
is a terrible job.

## POINTER 3147
I want to do something 
worth doing, you know?

## POINTER 3148
You stay here too long, you're 
going to regret it!

## POINTER 3149
You should get out as 
soon as you can...

## POINTER 3150
I don't want to be
in this dangerous place anymore...

## POINTER 3151
That's right, I'll change jobs! 
In the safest possible place... <PAGE>...Where in this world 
would that place be?

## POINTER 3152
Think there are any jobs out there 
that pay well for easy work?

## POINTER 3153
Probably not, huh...

## POINTER 3154
I want to quit the Knights,
but construction...?
I don't think so...<PAGE>Not that they're
hiring anyway...

## POINTER 3155
It's not easy
building a city...<PAGE>Maybe I'll go home to Zaphias...

## POINTER 3156
Build a house, get 1 point. 
Put in a beam, 0.5 points.<PAGE>Get enough points and you 
too can become nobility!

## POINTER 3157
Earning points to become 
nobility. The Council 
is pretty snazzy.

## POINTER 3158
Whew... thank goodness.
If I die here,
all my points were for nothing.<PAGE>Only 120 more points
until I'm nobility!

## POINTER 3159
It scared me.
The barrier blastia just went crazy.<PAGE>I guess death comes
even to the elite.

## POINTER 3160
Just take baby steps
and avoid all the
dangerous stuff.<PAGE>There's no point if you're dead.

## POINTER 3161
Sweeping gets you 0.05 points.
Hammering a nail, 0.001 points.<PAGE>These small tasks
will earn me points
to nobility!

## POINTER 3162
Only 110 more points
to nobility!<PAGE>...It's not easy...

## POINTER 3163
When will I
hit the max number
of nobility points...?

## POINTER 3164
Something's fishy...
Where did everyone go...?<PAGE>Will they really make
us nobles...?

## POINTER 3165
Maybe it's all
just a sham... <PAGE>Is that why everyone
went away...?

## POINTER 3166
What was that?ã€€I just heard
a big noise
from inside...

## POINTER 3167
What is it?
Do they have a big
pet monster or something?

## POINTER 3168
It seems there's no granting of nobility 
here no matter how hard you work.<PAGE>But if I'm at least paid what I'm owed, 
I would be all right with that.

## POINTER 3169
Now's the time to dig in and work!<PAGE>It's no fun being poor.

## POINTER 3170
They say there's no shame in being poor, 
but it's not easy to accept, is it?<PAGE>Of course, having faith in the notion that 
you're only as happy as you believe you 
are can be a wonderful placebo.

## POINTER 3171
Don't you believe a happy life demands 
a certain measure of affluence?<PAGE>"Honorable poverty"? The notion 
can go get itself stuffed.

## POINTER 3172
Someone who gets right up every time they're 
knocked down eventually becomes someone 
who can't be knocked down at all...<PAGE>Don't be afraid to fail 
your challenges. Be afraid 
of doing nothing!

## POINTER 3173
A single success can 
make up for a mountain 
of failures.<PAGE>The real trick to winning? 
Not stopping until you win.

## POINTER 3174
No matter how much people might like 
to deny it, in the end, the only person 
a man can rely on is himself.<PAGE>I'm going to work for my happiness, 
so you work for yours.

## POINTER 3175
Never forget that the search for a 
four-leaf clover mustn't lie on a 
trampled bed of three-leaved ones.<PAGE>That's not the way you go about 
searching for happiness.

## POINTER 3176
Almost all of your most important 
work turns out to be odd jobs.

## POINTER 3177
Of course, knowing they're odd doesn't 
mean you can perform them oddly.

## POINTER 3178
You just have to do everything you 
can, no matter what the situation.<PAGE>Results follow naturally.

## POINTER 3179
What happens if the results 
you get are bad?<PAGE>You can cross that bridge 
when you come to it.

## POINTER 3180
I'm alive and well today because 
of all the patient, simple work 
I've done to get to this point.<PAGE>I really believe that.

## POINTER 3181
Well, now...what was I 
going to work on today?

## POINTER 3182
First problems with 
the blastia...and 
now dragons?<PAGE>Fair enough...I'll just keep 
on doing what I must.

## POINTER 3183
They say today is the first day 
of the rest of your life, right?<PAGE>Every single day is precious.

## POINTER 3184
How long has it been since 
I came to this town 
to become a noble...?

## POINTER 3185
I'll be a noble soon...soon...

## POINTER 3186
Well, with that blastia incident,
the city will
soon be gone...

## POINTER 3187
I might die when the barrier disappears 
and the monsters come.<PAGE>Carve "Here lies the man who didn't 
become a noble" on my headstone.

## POINTER 3188
The barrier is secure
and I am safe.<PAGE>I narrowly escaped death
because God wants me to
become nobility.

## POINTER 3189
I won't die until I'm made noble.

## POINTER 3190
You can't become a noble with 
only a little hard work.<PAGE>Even if that means that I 
have to jump into the middle 
of a herd of monsters...

## POINTER 3191
The life a noble...very 
soon, it will be mine...

## POINTER 3192
*Huff*...*huff*...*huff*...<PAGE>Labor is becoming more
and more difficult lately...

## POINTER 3193
At this rate, I'm going to die 
before I'm made noble...

## POINTER 3194
My workload has lessened 
thanks to Sir <STR>(FRE).<PAGE>I'm very grateful.

## POINTER 3195
I heard a nasty rumor that nobody 
here will ever be made noble...<PAGE>But I won't believe it! I know that 
one day soon I'll have my nobility...

## POINTER 3196
Work here has gotten easier, but 
I've decided to put even more 
effort into it than before.<PAGE>How else am I to 
become noble...?

## POINTER 3197
I'm not cutting any corners! Not 
until I achieve nobility...

## POINTER 3198
If I quit now, all my struggles 
will have been for naught!<PAGE>I'll be a noble...whatever the cost...

## POINTER 3199
Nobility...some day 
soon...nobility...
