Your bodhi blastia sure 
are an interesting color.

## POINTER 5401
You must really have used 
your blastia a lot for them 
to develop that much.

## POINTER 5402
The sky above the capital seems to be a peculiar color. 
I'd like to go have a look at it myself. I just need 
to make some progress on this research first.

## POINTER 5403
It may be on account of the earthquakes 
recently, but a number of blastia have 
appeared on the mountain slope.

## POINTER 5404
On second thought, it might be the 
blastia that are causing the earthquakes... 
Wait, can that be it?

## POINTER 5405
Hey there! From Fortune's Market straight to you. 
We've got the items to scratch whatever itch you 
might have, and only at the cheapest prices.

## POINTER 5406
Come on in

## POINTER 5407
Saying that though, the empire's 
closed this place off, and no 
one is allowed to enter...<PAGE>*Sniffle, sniffle.*

## POINTER 5408
Saying that though, we've had to 
scale back on variety because business 
has been really dragging...<PAGE>*Sniffle, sniffle.*

## POINTER 5409
Business is as slow here 
as it's ever been...<PAGE>*Sniffle, sniffle.*

## POINTER 5410
There've been a lot of earthquakes recently... Do you think 
it might be a sign that something's going to happen?

## POINTER 5411
We are the guild Ruins' Gate. We engage primarily 
in the excavation of ancient ruins.<PAGE>It might not sound all that exciting, 
but we take pride in the work we do.

## POINTER 5412
We seek to uncover the world's 
past by way of our excavations.

## POINTER 5413
※※※To be decided by Mr./Ms. Baba

※※※Our Boss is a man of compassion 
who treats even us low-level members 
with dignity and respect.<PAGE>He's the shining example 
to which we all aspire.

※※※His timidity is the only thing 
about him you might call a flaw.

## POINTER 5416
Take a rest for 200 Gald? It is 
a bookshelf, you understand.

## POINTER 5417
We are the guild Ruins' Gate. We 
put our lives on the line in the 
excavation of the world's ruins.<PAGE>If our mission takes us into the 
mouth of danger, so be it.

## POINTER 5418
When we must go to hazardous 
areas, we hire other guilds 
to act as our guards.

## POINTER 5419
Tomorrow will be the same as today, 
excavation... But digging around in 
the dirt is actually quite enjoyable.<PAGE>Who could help being moved 
by that magic of digging 
up some glorious relic?

## POINTER 5420
Not even slimy earthworms will make 
us yield, nor shed a single tear.

## POINTER 5421
Was Regaey replaced by some imposter 
when we weren't looking? <PAGE>Ah well. No matter, so long as 
we can continue our excavation.

## POINTER 5422
Speaking of, it's excavation time, baby.♪

## POINTER 5423
I can see some kind of shadow 
in the sky... It's like 
an ominous sign... <PAGE>We could just move around from 
one ruin to another ruin but the 
mage here would be desperate.

## POINTER 5424
Maybe I'll strike out to the frontiers of the 
world and continue my excavating there. It's 
not like I can simply give up this lifestyle.

## POINTER 5425
Our Boss is a man of compassion 
who treats even us low-level members 
with dignity and respect.<PAGE>He's the shining example 
to which we all aspire.

## POINTER 5426
His timidity is the only thing about 
him you might call a flaw.

## POINTER 5427
Regaey is our Boss. He's a veritable 
paragon of humanity.<PAGE>It's thanks to his many achievements as 
our leader that we rose to the position 
of one of the five master guilds.

## POINTER 5428
If only he could exhibit just a 
touch more bravery now and then.

## POINTER 5429
How many years has it been since Regaey 
took over as Boss, I wonder.<PAGE>You wouldn't guess from looking at him, but he's 
incredibly gifted. With his "god hand" technique, 
he can unearth a blastia with a single strike.

## POINTER 5430
I've heard that the Boss actually can't 
stand visiting ruins. I wonder if 
it's the monsters that get to him.

## POINTER 5431
So, Yeager of Leviathan's Claw 
was Regaey all along...<PAGE>No way! Yeager must have 
just been acting as 
Regaey's stand in!

## POINTER 5432
So wait. That doesn't mean we're actually low-level 
members of Leviathan's Claw, right?

## POINTER 5433
So Yeager died too... 
Where is Ruins' Gate going 
to go from here? <PAGE>...I guess it's no use 
asking you, though.

## POINTER 5434
I guess we should count ourselves 
lucky we didn't have to 
help sell weapons...

## POINTER 5435
Hello and good evening. Is 
this your first visit to 
Nordopolica's coliseum?<PAGE>To reach the coliseum please continue to 
the north and go up the stairway, okay?∀

## POINTER 5436
If you wish to leave town, just 
follow the path to the left 
and you'll reach the exit.<PAGE>No one would really ever 
choose to go outside 
though, would they?

## POINTER 5437
Good evening. Welcome 
to Nordopolica.<PAGE>Will you be competing in tonight's tournament? Or 
perhaps you've just come to watch? There's also plenty 
to buy for those itching to do some shopping!♪

## POINTER 5438
If you follow the road to the west, 
you'll come to a mountain. I'm afraid 
it's a bit impassable, though.<PAGE>There's really no point going 
outside at all, is there?

## POINTER 5439
Good evening. This 
is Nordopolica.<PAGE>The sights and sounds can be quite overwhelming, 
but we hope you'll take the time 
to make yourselves at home.

## POINTER 5440
All of the escaped monsters 
have been rounded back up.<PAGE>Please don't let it interfere 
with your enjoyment.

## POINTER 5441
Good evening, and welcome 
to Nordopolica!♪ <PAGE>Exciting tournaments, great 
shopping, and fireworks 
when the weather is fine!

## POINTER 5442
Welcome back to Nordopolica. There may be something 
weird up in the sky, but it won't dampen 
the spirits of anyone in this town.<PAGE>How about you? Why not stay 
a while and enjoy yourselves?

## POINTER 5443
To tell the truth, I'm scared witless. 
...Yikes, my legs won't stop shaking...

## POINTER 5444
Welcome to Nordopolica. It's always a 
pleasure seeing our regular visitors.<PAGE>In this day and age, what else 
is there to do but party like 
it's going out of style?!

## POINTER 5445
In times like this, those who enjoy themselves 
the most come out on top. Come on now, what are 
you waiting for? Get in there and have a ball!

## POINTER 5446
Oh yeah! 
Let's rock!

## POINTER 5447
Are you feeling 
the coliseum 
fever?

## POINTER 5448
Tip top, hip hop, 
and you don't stop!

## POINTER 5449
The coliseum's makin' some 
noise! You know I've come 
to bring the noise!

## POINTER 5450
Heey, there's a party over here! 
Heey, there's a party over there!

## POINTER 5451
It's a long and winding 
road, but we'll run 
it together, mayne!

## POINTER 5452
Bibbidy, bobbity, 
do-wop shu-wop!

## POINTER 5453
The mood's sorta blue up in 
here, but what's that got 
to do with a kid like me?

## POINTER 5454
Sha la la la lah, 
sha la la la lah!

## POINTER 5455
They can't stop me, they can 
only hope to contain me!♪

## POINTER 5456
Dum da da dum da 
da dum dum dum!

## POINTER 5457
Everybody's down in the dumps, 
so I've gotta keep things 
jumpin' around here!

## POINTER 5458
Dah da dah! Dug a dugga 
dug a dugga daaah...♪

## POINTER 5459
Come on, say it with me! 
Dah da dah! Dug a dugga 
dug a dugga daaah...♪

## POINTER 5460
Same goes for the placement 
of the towns, too. Towns could be built because the place 
was suitable for the making barrier blastias. *Hic!*

## POINTER 5461
You can see some giant shadow 
of a monster in the sky, but we're 
protected by the barrier.<PAGE>You know those huge pillars surrounding 
the city? Those are Nordopolica's 
barrier blastia.

## POINTER 5462
Yo! Are you guys here to 
get a glimpse of some spectacular 
battling action?<PAGE>Tournament tickets are made 
of platinum, so they're pretty 
hard to get a hold of.

## POINTER 5463
Huh? You don't mean you're entering 
the tournament, do you?<PAGE>You won't even make it through the first 
round with an itsy-bitsy body like that.

## POINTER 5464
Sounds like the tournament champion and 
the latest challenger really got into it 
today and brought the whole house down.<PAGE>Oooh! I could just 
kick myself for not 
going to see it!

## POINTER 5465
What? You were the challenger? 
...If you're trying to tell 
a joke, you should try again.

## POINTER 5466
*Grumble, grumble...* Don't 
talk to me, man...<PAGE>The coliseum being shut down 
is totally stressing me out... 
*Grumble, grumble.*

## POINTER 5467
Sheesh. So they let the monsters 
get out, and now the town's in a 
panic... *Grumble, grumble...*

## POINTER 5468
So, who's the killer supposed 
to be? It'd be nice to know who 
they'll be going to war with.

## POINTER 5469
Sheesh. Those damned Knights're so uptight 
and serious about everything.<PAGE>They should go and watch the tournaments. 
Maybe then they'd loosen up a little.

## POINTER 5470
Man, is this ever boring. What the hell 
made these Knights such sticks in the 
mud? That's what I'd like to know.

## POINTER 5471
Just what's the fuss over this 
monster in the sky, anyway?<PAGE>If you got all the heavy-hitters in this 
town together, there's nothing in this world 
so scary that they couldn't handle it.

## POINTER 5472
Quit hangin' around up there! 
Why don't you come down here 
and show us what you've got?!

## POINTER 5473
First we get monsters in the 
sky, and next it's this weird 
tower. Aspio, was it?<PAGE>That thing actually looks sort 
of like a monster, too.

## POINTER 5474
What is it with monsters today, and all their conniving 
little tricks...? Whatever happened to solving things 
with a good old fashioned knock down, drag out brawl?!

## POINTER 5475
*Sigh...* Nothing like a quiet night to soothe 
the wearied soul... Want some tips?<PAGE>Excuse me if I'm not overly excited. 
You're my only customers so far.

## POINTER 5476
My predictions just don't seem 
to hit the mark, lately...

## POINTER 5477
*Sigh...* None of my tips ever 
seem to pay off anymore.<PAGE>Now I'm stuck having to give back 
all the money I charged...

## POINTER 5478
Maybe it's time to get out 
of the betting business...

## POINTER 5479
*Sigh* Nothing like a 
quiet night to bring out 
the sadness in a person... <PAGE>It's been so long since any of 
my tips paid off that I just can't  
stop these tears from falling.

## POINTER 5480
Bad weather seems to follow me, wherever I go...

## POINTER 5481
During the day, you know... I can put up a tough 
front. But once night rolls around, my heart 
goes dark right along with the sky...<PAGE>I guess it's for the best that 
you were my only customers...

## POINTER 5482
Things are so peaceful 
at night... Why can't it 
stay dark forever...?

## POINTER 5483
Hey... I try my best not to talk 
to socialize much at night.<PAGE>You wouldn't believe how 
bad my mood can get...

## POINTER 5484
My unhappiness is likely to rub off 
on you if you come too close...

## POINTER 5485
*Sigh...* Just what am I 
doing here, anyway...?<PAGE>What's the use of a tipster whose 
tips never come true...?

## POINTER 5486
Whoa, this isn't good... Now I've 
started questioning what I'm 
really doing with my life...

## POINTER 5487
This old man is listening so intently, 
I have to wonder if this tipster might 
not actually be on to something.<PAGE>I've never thought of placing 
a bet before, but maybe 
I should give it a try.

## POINTER 5488
But just what is he 
doing in the betting 
business, anyway?<PAGE>If he really thinks he can pick 
the winners, why doesn't he keep 
the information all to himself?

## POINTER 5489
Hoh hoh, I've got it. It must be that 
it sounds like a bunch of hooey, but 
that there's actually a logic to it.<PAGE>Maybe his predictions come 
true after all... I think 
I might give it a try...

## POINTER 5490
Just when you think a person is nothing 
more than a muscle-bound simpleton, they 
turn out to be quite intelligent.<PAGE>Never judge a book by 
its cover, I suppose.

## POINTER 5491
Listen to this. I made 200,000 
Gald just by following the 
advice this man gave me!<PAGE>Oh, Itoken, thank goodness 
I believed in you!

## POINTER 5492
I'm putting 500,000 Gald on his 
next hot tip to win it big!<PAGE>The sky's the limit!

## POINTER 5493
With all these Knights around, 
I can't shake the feeling 
that I'm being watched.<PAGE>Do you think it's safe for 
me to be placing bets out 
in the open like this?

## POINTER 5494
You don't think...they'll 
arrest us, do you?

## POINTER 5495
Oh, my heart is breaking... 
Because the Duce died...?<PAGE>Hell no! I just flushed 500,000 
Gald down the drain!

## POINTER 5496
Oh the sadness... It's just 
too much for me to bear...

## POINTER 5497
I'm going to take the 2 million Gald 
I've been keeping in my shoe, and 
win back everything I've lost!<PAGE>Okay, Itoken, show 
me the money!

## POINTER 5498
The sky? I've got no time for that right 
now. My life is on the line here...!

## POINTER 5499
I lost... I lost it all... 
What sort of betting 
business is this?<PAGE>Oh no... Have I 
been swindled?
