## POINTER 4000
My orders are to protect 
the capital and its citizens. <PAGE>No matter what may 
happen outside, I 
must fulfill my duty.

## POINTER 4001
I can only trust that those 
who left the city will deal with 
whatever is happening outside.

## POINTER 4002
Damn... I sure pulled the 
short end of the stick. <PAGE>I can't believe 
I have to guard 
the lower quarter...

## POINTER 4003
The lower quarter
is even further out 
than the ramparts. <PAGE>This is bad. 
It's the worst 
place for a battle.

## POINTER 4004
<STR>(FRE) helped 
evacuate a lot of 
residents from the city. <PAGE>Most of the lower 
quarter stayed, though. 
They said they'd never leave.

## POINTER 4005
<STR>(FRE) asked us to take care of 
the lower quarter, so he must plan 
on coming back eventually.

## POINTER 4006
Oh man... I'm done. 
I'm so done. <PAGE>With the barrier gone... 
It's just... It's over. 
I'm done.

## POINTER 4007
Fight monsters? 
Me? <PAGE>No no no. Uh-uh. 
There's no way I 
could do that!

## POINTER 4008
Aaaah! This is it! 
It's the end!<PAGE>Even the Knights can't 
beat that thing!

## POINTER 4009
That monster's 
gonna devour us!

## POINTER 4010
Hey, are the 
Knights bad guys?

## POINTER 4011
Everyone's saying 
the capital going all crazy 
is Alexei's fault.<PAGE>What a letdown...

## POINTER 4012
Did you hear about the 
new town Captain <STR>(FRE)
built in Hypionia? <PAGE>I wanna go live in 
Captain <STR>(FRE)'s town...

## POINTER 4013
I'm gonna go to the new 
town and have Captain <STR>(FRE)
teach me how to use a sword! <PAGE>I'm gonna be 
a knight, just like 
Captain <STR>(FRE)!

## POINTER 4014
All of Captain <STR>(FRE)'s 
people took off! <PAGE>So why do we have to 
work in the capital?

## POINTER 4015
If we don't run, we'll die! 
We have to abandon Zaphias!

## POINTER 4016
The whole barrier thing 
is only a temporary fix. <PAGE>It's only a matter of time 
before the barrier goes down 
again and monsters attack.

## POINTER 4017
It's all over, it's all over! 
The capital! My life!Ohhh... <PAGE>Why did I ever 
become a knight...

## POINTER 4018
*Woof woof!*

## POINTER 4019
*Wooo*

## POINTER 4020
*Meow*

## POINTER 4021
*Meow∀*

## POINTER 4022
*Meooow meooow*

## POINTER 4023
*Woof woof!!*

## POINTER 4024
You and your friends 
fixed that weird sky, 
right <STR>(YUR)? <PAGE>Now we can go out and play! 
Thank you...tee-hee!♪

## POINTER 4025
Are you gonna leave 
again, <STR>(YUR)? <PAGE>Everyone's gonna work 
together and fix the town back 
up, so come back soon!

## POINTER 4026
<STR>(YUR), are you 
feeling down?

## POINTER 4027
I'm not scared at all. 
I know you'll take care 
of this, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 4028
I heard <STR>(FRE) made a 
new town, but you're not 
going are you, <STR>(YUR)? <PAGE>This is your home, after all.

## POINTER 4029
This is your home, <STR>(YUR). 
I'll always have something nice 
and hot ready for you to eat!

## POINTER 4030
You can find us Synth 
Tellers all over the world!<PAGE>If you're looking for one, 
just remember we usually 
hang out around shops.

## POINTER 4031
Synthesis technology advances 
with time. Check back often 
to find out what's new.

## POINTER 4032
My little sister seems to 
have gotten used to 
that thing already.<PAGE>All the adults are still 
worried about it, but children 
are so quick to change...

## POINTER 4033
I'm still scared... 
Even though I'm 
still a kid.

## POINTER 4034
I'm a Synth Teller! I'll let 
you know when there are new 
items you can synthesize!<PAGE>Come by and talk to me 
anytime! Who knows what 
you'll be able to make!

## POINTER 4035
You can find us Synth Tellers all over the world! 
If you're looking for one, 
just remember we usually hang out around shops.

## POINTER 4036
You can find us Synth Tellers all over the world! 
If you're looking for one, just remember we 
usually hang out around shops.

## POINTER 4037
There's an oasis called 
Mantaic past the mountain 
range to the west.<PAGE>It's really a jewel in the middle of the desert, 
with a big blue lake and verdant greenery. 
I suppose that's why they call it an oasis. *Hic!*

## POINTER 4038
Even so, it's blisteringly hot, 
and you have to cross a treacherous 
mountain range to get there.

## POINTER 4039
Older gentlemen who shoot a 
little higher should be 
calm in these situations,<PAGE>and be rid of the monster 
with one telling blow!

## POINTER 4040
You can find us Synth Tellers all over the world!
If you're looking for one, just remember we 
usually hang out around shops.

## POINTER 4041
I think there is a demand
for information about synthesis.
That's why I started.

## POINTER 4042
Security's light in the royal quarter 
because it's relatively safe. <PAGE>The lower quarter and citizen 
quarter would get attacked first. 
Everyone's guarding those areas.

## POINTER 4043
Of course, the nobles are 
all worked up saying we're 
not protecting them. <PAGE>That's why I hate the royal 
quarter post...it's easier 
dealing with the monsters.

## POINTER 4044
This post is more about 
hearing the nobles' complaints 
and less about security. <PAGE>I can't stand it anymore. 
I'm going to go bald...

## POINTER 4045
And our helmets are so hot. 
They're murder on the 
scalp. I can't get a break.

## POINTER 4046
Hey hey hey! You're <STR>(YUR), the 
friend of Acting Commandant 
<STR>(FRE), right? <PAGE>Oh, don't you worry about 
the whole "nobles only" thing. 
Go ahead!

## POINTER 4047
This exit is actually for nobles 
only, but you saved Zaphias! <PAGE>I can make an exception 
for you, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 4048
We're here to maintain security 
as new control is established 
following Belius's death.

## POINTER 4049
We have no intention of 
staying and attempting to 
seize control of the city.<PAGE>You may set your minds at ease.

## POINTER 4050
That thing will be the fiercest 
enemy we Knights have faced 
in our entire history.<PAGE>It may very well fall to 
us to dispatch that 
giant monster...

## POINTER 4051
Of course, our maximum 
priority remains ensuring 
this city's safety.<PAGE>It's an unfortunate thing.

## POINTER 4052
I left my wife and 
child in Zaphias.<PAGE>I'm worried about them...so worried, but...<PAGE>No. I must fulfill my 
duty to guard this city.

## POINTER 4053
Upholding one's assigned 
mission is the very 
first tenet of knighthood.

## POINTER 4054
Meow! Meow! Meow!∀

## POINTER 4055
Meow! Meow!♪

## POINTER 4056
They say Mantaic used to be totally free, 
not under Empire or Guild control.<PAGE>But thanks to that ghastly temporary magistrate, 
the Imperial Knights have finally extended 
their jurisdiction there. *Hic!*

## POINTER 4057
With knights here in Nordopolica too, 
it's not easy to look at Mantaic's situation 
as someone else's problem.<PAGE>I can't help but sympathize.

## POINTER 4058
The Knights showed up, 
Duce Belius died, 
monsters escaped...<PAGE>And now there's an unbeaten champion. 
This town has gone mad.

## POINTER 4059
Ahh...I wish they would 
just leave already...*Hic!*

## POINTER 4060
I swear I saw a giant bug 
striding atop the ocean, 
just as casual as could be.<PAGE>I guess it must have been a dream, 
but it seemed 
so realistic...*Hic!*

## POINTER 4061
A bug...it was definitely a bug. 
Like a giant beetle.<PAGE>A beetle on the sea... 
Heh! How zany. *Hic!*

## POINTER 4062
I didn't realize at first 
because of all their armor, 
but the knights are so young!<PAGE>You get their armor off 
and they're no older than my 
boy training in Dahngrest. *Hic!*

## POINTER 4063
*Sigh* Now I'm off thinking 
about my son.<PAGE>All those young knights must 
have mothers waiting for 
them just like me...*Hic!*

## POINTER 4064
That monster gave me quite a shock!... 
But Palestralle are here right?<PAGE>What? The knights? 
No...No, they were all scared! *Hic!*

## POINTER 4065
They can’t rely on the Knights.
The Guild should protect them.
*Hic*

## POINTER 4066
All the knight boys are 
starved for home cooking, 
let me tell you.<PAGE>I brought them some rice balls and miso
soup the other day, and you should have
seen how fast they ate it! *Hic!*

## POINTER 4067
It's nice to have someone 
appreciate your cooking.<PAGE>Maybe I'll bake them a 
nice peach pie next time. *Hic!*

## POINTER 4068
Older gentlemen who shoot a little higher refrain from 
revealing their nightingale-sweet voices too early!<PAGE>Instead, they roar like beasts while fighting, 
then finally raise a mighty, yet beautiful victory 
cheer upon victory! The girls go wild!

## POINTER 4069
Older gentlemen who shoot a little higher 
keep a low profile and live in the shadows!<PAGE>We only show our faces if our true love 
is in a jam, bail her out in the blink 
of an eye, and are gone like the wind!

## POINTER 4070
Older gentlemen who shoot a little higher 
aren't trifled by the sad or distressing!<PAGE>We take it all with smiles on our faces, 
fight to win, shed manly tears of victory, 
and own the hearts of women everywhere!

## POINTER 4071
Older gentlemen who shoot a little higher 
never deny their opponents' strength, but 
neither do they deny their weaknesses!<PAGE>Instead, we accept reality as it is, always 
striving to ever-greater heights!

## POINTER 4072
Older gentlemen who shoot a little 
higher put themselves last, and 
hurry to others' rescue first!<PAGE>And we take care of ourselves even as 
we're solving other peoples' crises!

## POINTER 4073
What?! 
The barrier...?<PAGE>This is weird.

## POINTER 4074
I was watching 
over it like a hawk. 
Really! I swear!

## POINTER 4075
I feel bad for the 
guard who died.<PAGE>I will succeed the position and 
guard the barrier blastia, the 
core of our town, to my death!

## POINTER 4076
This time, I will 
guard it so that this 
never happens again!<PAGE>All is normal!

## POINTER 4077
So we held off the monster 
attack. That doesn't change the 
fact that monsters still exist.<PAGE>The peace of Dahngrest
depends on this 
barrier blastia!

## POINTER 4078
My job protecting the 
barrier blastia is a 
very important one.<PAGE>Therefore, my job 
is very rewarding!

## POINTER 4079
N-no matter what the monster, 
th-this barrier blastia w-will 
keep this town safe...<PAGE>B-but, I've never 
seen a monster as 
big as that one...!

## POINTER 4080
The monsters broke through 
the barrier... Human wisdom has 
been defeated... Oh, the shame!

## POINTER 4081
What exactly was that 
monster that got 
inside the barrier?<PAGE>We strengthened the town's 
security after that incident. 
All is clear for now!

## POINTER 4082
There must have been 
something different 
about that monster!<PAGE>I will not tolerate another 
breach of the barrier!

## POINTER 4083
I have carved the Don's 
last words into my heart.<PAGE>I will protect this barrier
so that the people of this town
can live by his words!

## POINTER 4084
The Don may have 
passed, but his dreams 
will forever live on!

## POINTER 4085
The world is what it is, 
so we must protect the 
barrier at all costs!<PAGE>Those who believe
will be saved!

## POINTER 4086
The monster in the sky is 
nothing to be afraid of as 
long as we have the barrier!

## POINTER 4087
Rumor has it 
that Heracles
smashed into Zaphias. <PAGE>I wonder if the 
capital is safe.

## POINTER 4088
What does it really mean to be a 
knight? Is it protecting the Hold, 
even with that weird sky?

## POINTER 4089
Outside visitors are 
prohibted from entering 
the station.

## POINTER 4090
Thank you very much. 
Please stay with us again.

## POINTER 4091
Welcome. 
You may rest here for 300 Gald. 
Will you be staying?

## POINTER 4092
The continent of Tolbyccia got 
Capua Torim and 
Dahngrest on it.<PAGE>And in Dahngrest, 
there's the Union that 
brings the Guilds together.

## POINTER 4093
The head of the Union's called 
the Don, and everyone's 
a-scared of him.

## POINTER 4094
You ever met the Don? 
He's one seriously tough customer.

## POINTER 4095
Thanks to the Don in Dahngrest, 
all the scattered Guilds are 
brought together.

## POINTER 4096
But it's just like him to kill 
himself with his own sword.

## POINTER 4097
After the Don died, 
I was too scared 
to go back...<PAGE>I can't imagine the 
chaos in Dahngrest...

## POINTER 4098
I'm so worried about the wife and 
child I've left in Dahngrest,.... 
....should I try to go back...

## POINTER 4099
Now I hear the 
Empire's a mess, 
too.
