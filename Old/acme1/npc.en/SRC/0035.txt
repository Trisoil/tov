## POINTER 3500
I'm not sure whether to be grateful or 
perturbed. It's a strange feeling...

## POINTER 3501
You're awake.
Are you alright?<PAGE>You passed out by
the town entrance.

## POINTER 3502
You don't have to pay me.<PAGE>I brought you here
in the first place.

## POINTER 3503
If you're looking for
your friends, they're
outside already.

## POINTER 3504
Welcome, travelers. 
It's 50 Gald per night...will 
you stay?

## POINTER 3505
Thank you. Come 
back for a stay 
any time.

## POINTER 3506
Hmm? Are you all right already?<PAGE>You can rest as long 
as you need to.

## POINTER 3507
Don't you go getting yourselves 
knocked out again, you hear?<PAGE>Next time, I'll be 
charging boarding 
fee! Tee-hee.

## POINTER 3508
You're all wearing such 
unusual clothes.<PAGE>We don't really see anything 
like them around here. Did you 
come from very far away?

## POINTER 3509
Is your food 
very different 
as well?<PAGE>I'd love to hear 
some recipes from 
your hometowns.

## POINTER 3510
It's so hot...there's no shade 
at all...wearing this armor 
is like being on a grill...<PAGE>Stand guard here...? 
It's torture...

## POINTER 3511
Our mission is to protect 
the Ruins' Gate researchers 
from monsters, but...<PAGE>...I think the heat is going 
to kill us first...

## POINTER 3512
When will I be able 
to...go home...?<PAGE>They swore...a relief unit was 
coming to take over for us...

## POINTER 3513
...Hey...it scares me to 
think about this, but...<PAGE>You don't think this is a demotion 
transfer...do you...?

## POINTER 3514
Ah! You are friends 
of Sir <STR>(FRE)?<PAGE>Please, ask me anything. 
I'll be happy to tell 
you whatever I can!

## POINTER 3515
We are here investigating the 
ruins, to determine why Captain 
Alexei came to these lands!<PAGE>However, with ruin excavation being 
outside our realm of expertise, we have 
employed the help of Ruins' Gate!

## POINTER 3516
I'm ashamed to say we have a knight 
collapsing every single day here.<PAGE>My partner fell unconscious as well, 
and was withdrawn back to Zaphias. He 
always pushes himself too hard...

## POINTER 3517
The bizarre monster that 
appeared in the sky...what 
do you suppose it is?<PAGE>It smells like an emergency situation 
to me, but with things as they are...we 
wouldn't be any help...

## POINTER 3518
The <STR>(FRE) Brigade is a 
ranger unit, so we were able to 
see so many different places...<PAGE>To be frank, standing guard 
here isn't very fun at 
all. And it's so hot...

## POINTER 3519
Captain <STR>(FRE) may seem 
so kind, but he pushes 
his men hard.<PAGE>Of course, you can't really 
complain when he's pushing 
himself so hard, too.

## POINTER 3520
I haven't seen any other units 
at all lately, let alone 
our replacement unit...<PAGE>I wonder if all the other knights 
have gone to deal with that 
strange monster in the sky.

## POINTER 3521
I hear our captain 
is leading the way.<PAGE>Say...you don't suppose Sir <STR>(FRE) 
has forgotten about us because 
of that monster, do you?

## POINTER 3522
I suppose things as strange as the Imperial 
Knights hiring us for something other 
than blastia excavation do happen.<PAGE>We're supposed to be searching for clues as to some 
knight captain's motive. Do you think there's 
been some internal friction among the Knights?

## POINTER 3523
Whatever the reason, all we have 
to do is complete the investigation 
we've been tasked with.<PAGE>The areas we have to search are 
rather harsh on this job, though. 
We'll have to charge extra...

## POINTER 3524
Our initial investigations have 
revealed one thing. These ruins 
are very mysterious...<PAGE>We believe they're some one thousand years 
old, but we haven't been able to identify 
the reasons for this weathering.

## POINTER 3525
Even supposing it collapsed 
due to a monster attack...the 
weathering is so unnatural.<PAGE>By the good name of 
Ruins' Gate, we'll 
solve this mystery!

## POINTER 3526
Hmm...these ruins 
are so intriguing.<PAGE>Judging by the condition of these stone 
fragments, I'd say this place is very old...perhaps 
as much as a thousand years.

## POINTER 3527
Looking at these fragments, I think 
it's safe to venture that this place 
was destroyed by some outside force.<PAGE>There were no blastia yet, so 
perhaps the collapse was because 
of a monster attack...

## POINTER 3528
These ruins are so unusual...but 
people definitely 
lived here.<PAGE>We've found several 
traces of habitation.

## POINTER 3529
Pieces of buildings, too. Monsters 
don't really have architectural 
skills, now do they?<PAGE>If I had to guess, 
I'd say this was a Kritya 
settlement...

## POINTER 3530
Our next show will be "The 
Righteous Bandits" as performed 
by the Dark Wings.<PAGE>Please be patient while 
they finish getting 
everything in order.

## POINTER 3531
The special stage
is up ahead.<PAGE>You can watch plays
and musicals there.

## POINTER 3532
Hey, hey.
Come back anytime,
ya hear?

## POINTER 3533
Welcome, welcome.
Go right on ahead.<PAGE>Feel free to take a look,
take a look.

## POINTER 3534
I bet this is 
new to you. <PAGE>If you want, I can give you 
a lecture♪

## POINTER 3535
Good times,
good times.<PAGE>This brings back
good memories.

## POINTER 3536
Well... I just wanted to 
say something like that. <PAGE>I feel so different 
in this costume.

## POINTER 3537
Hmmm. A festival for lower class people 
is more fun than I was expecting. <PAGE>The world they live 
is too different
from the world I live in...

## POINTER 3538
I've seen their performance many times but 
I don't get tired of them at all! <PAGE>Ahh, 
I want to see their performance 
more and more!!!

## POINTER 3539
Do you guys know? 
The Showtime, play Guild is 
here for their performance! <PAGE>They are famous for 
their hard to get 
tickets.

## POINTER 3540
There, there. It's there! 
Hey, hurry up! <PAGE>Don't give me that weird look!

## POINTER 3541
Here, here! 
The (c) M sculpture 
is here! <PAGE>I wonder how many more times? 
Two times? Three times? or 
Humm...

## POINTER 3542
I am going to wear this 
to the ball tonight. <PAGE>Well, it's only a Lantern 
Festival Dance though..

## POINTER 3543
Tee-hee-hee. 
Isn't this dress 
cute! <PAGE>I secretly borrowed this from 
the costume room. 
Don't tell anybody!

## POINTER 3544
It's a double push!

## POINTER 3545
It's very unprofitable...

## POINTER 3546
I want to try goldfish scooping,
but I also want some stir-fry
noodles, or maybe even some pizza...

## POINTER 3547
There's so much
to choose from! ∀

## POINTER 3548
This is made from
the finest material.<PAGE>What do you think?
Looks good, huh?

## POINTER 3549
Armor that covers the whole body 
is heavy, but armor like this 
is just the right weight. <PAGE>It makes me feel like I 
want to kill monsters.

## POINTER 3550
An 8, huh?
That’s a tough one.<PAGE>It seems like it could
be a LOW, yet it could
turn out to be a HIGH...

## POINTER 3551
Huh? 
Of course, 
I am talking about double-up. <PAGE>There is a trap
after continuous successes.

## POINTER 3552
You can bring 
your handouts 
for this test. <PAGE>You might think it makes it easy, but 
it means that it'll be that much harder.

## POINTER 3553
I am definitely going to get 
a Mishica PhD!

## POINTER 3554
*Woo--f**

## POINTER 3555
*Woof Woof*

## POINTER 3556
*Meow?*

## POINTER 3557
*Meow* *Meow* *Meow?*

## POINTER 3558
*Meow...*

## POINTER 3559
*Meooow...*

## POINTER 3560
*Woof woof!*

## POINTER 3561
*Woof...*

## POINTER 3562
We can survive 
even without blastia.<PAGE>I don't need anything 
else, as long as I 
have her love.

## POINTER 3563
Her love completes me, 
body and sould. I'm sure 
she feels the same.

## POINTER 3564
... I'm happy he built a 
home for me and all, but...
It's just a tent...<PAGE>I wish it had been a log 
cabin or something, 
like that one over there...

## POINTER 3565
A tent... Well, I guess it's 
better than camping out on the 
road like the last few days.

## POINTER 3566
What's gonna happen? I hear the 
blastia will stop working... 
I'm starving...<PAGE>This guy talks about 
love, love, love... but 
that's not all there is...

## POINTER 3567
More than love... there's money. 
That's right! This guy 
has money, right?<PAGE>He kind of goes 
overboard, but I 
guess I can deal...

## POINTER 3568
Come visit us any time!

## POINTER 3569
We're fully stocked up 
on supplies now. 
No more inconveniences!

## POINTER 3570
This is all thanks to the 
support that Fortune's 
Market gave us.

## POINTER 3571
Geez, my wife's 
still complainin'. 
I can't stand this!<PAGE>That woman, she just won't give 
in... Even though she's really 
gotten used to it here by now.

## POINTER 3572
When I'm working, I can 
forget my wife's whining. 
It feels great!

## POINTER 3573
I guess this is how 
people form bonds.

## POINTER 3574
The world should never have 
to face crises, but this 
town owes its existence to one.

## POINTER 3575
There could still be
a few monsters roaming
in the residential district.<PAGE>We’re going to stay here
until we can confirm it is safe.

## POINTER 3576
We’re going to keep
this town safe.

## POINTER 3577
All lives carry with 
them pain and burden.

## POINTER 3578
But the Tree of Halure endures 
it all, in infinite patience.

## POINTER 3579
Most people are in 
their beds sick. <PAGE>Maybe something's going 
around. I seem to be the 
only one who's okay.

## POINTER 3580
Everyone got sick after 
that tower showed up.

## POINTER 3581
*Woof!*

## POINTER 3582
*Woof♪*

## POINTER 3583
Hey, were you 
playing tag with 
the Knights?

## POINTER 3584
Hey, why don't you join the 
<STR>(FRE) Defense Force, too?<PAGE>Hee-hee. I'm the founder 
of the <STR>(FRE) Defense 
Force, you know.

## POINTER 3585
I've watched him for a while. 
I formed the Defense Force 
when he made captain. <PAGE>Our main activities are 
rooting for <STR>(FRE) and 
talking with other members.

## POINTER 3586
I was so worried with 
the barrier gone.<PAGE>I don't know what 
would've happened if the 
barrier didn't get fixed.

## POINTER 3587
I have to thank whoever 
fixed the barrier blastia.

## POINTER 3588
They say young 
<STR>(FRE) built a 
new town in Hypionia.<PAGE>Will you be joining <STR>(FRE)
there, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 3589
I'd love to go myself, 
but traveling so far 
at this age...

## POINTER 3590
This is all the imperial 
family's fault. They neglected 
their duties as our guardians.

## POINTER 3591
I'm not scared...
I'm not scared.<PAGE>I can do it...
I can do it.

## POINTER 3592
I-I gave up my life in
Zaphias to be here.<PAGE>A few monsters a-aren’t
going to s-scare me....

## POINTER 3593
T-the monsters are lose?!<PAGE>Eek! I-I'm scared...!

## POINTER 3594
What's going on upstairs?!
Let's make a run for it...<PAGE>Oh! My legs can't move...

## POINTER 3595
I'm strong...yes, very strong.
I'm the strongest one in the
world...no, in the universe!

## POINTER 3596
But...no matter how much I encourage 
myself, I've never been very 
strong at all... Oh dear...

## POINTER 3597
No no no. I don't care if you're 
desperate. Try again when you 
are of the proper status. <PAGE>You would have no problem 
if you were, say, the 
Commandant of the Knights.

## POINTER 3598
This exit is for 
nobles only. <PAGE>You cannot leave 
from here. No no no.

## POINTER 3599
Well...I suppose I 
could let you pass 
if you were famous.
