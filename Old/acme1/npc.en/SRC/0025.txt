## POINTER 2500
There are many of us with the same 
profession in this world, but we're 
not all in the same guild.<PAGE>What I mean to say is, 
I have nothing to do with 
the Blood Alliance.

## POINTER 2501
It's not very fun getting 
confused with a group that 
has such a bad reputation.

## POINTER 2502
The Blood Alliance's power 
is weakening. Now's our chance 
to rise to the top.

## POINTER 2503
It's one thing to be enthusiastic, I guess, 
but we're kind of short on people...

## POINTER 2504
I wish I could have seen the 
last moments of a man as great 
as the Don with my own eyes.

## POINTER 2505
If only I had gone back 
to Dahngrest, I would 
have been able to...

## POINTER 2506
I went to see what things were like in 
Nor. A friend of mine contacted me, 
saying it was really bad in Zaphias.

## POINTER 2507
If we play our cards right, 
we might be able to make 
our guild famous...

## POINTER 2508
If we play our cards right, 
we might be able to make 
our Guild famous...

## POINTER 2509
Do you think we could be one of 
the Five Master Guilds if we 
killed that thing in the sky?

## POINTER 2510
No, no, wait, wait...look 
at reality, man. There's no 
way to beat that thing.

## POINTER 2511
Ooh, hello, you cuties. 
How'd you like a game 
with little old me?♪<PAGE>If you think I'll be a pushover 
just because I'm a woman...you're 
going to get burned!∀

## POINTER 2512
I'm plenty tougher than any 
of the lousy men around here.

## POINTER 2513
All the guys here are just don't have 
any energy lately. It's so irritating.

## POINTER 2514
All people eventually 
die. The Don, me, you.

## POINTER 2515
If your spirits are down, the 
only thing to do is play. 
How about it? Like a match?

## POINTER 2516
Too bad. I thought I'd 
show you a good time.

## POINTER 2517
I thought the Commandant
was just the Empire's a dog...<PAGE>But he really
proved his worth
in the rebellion!

## POINTER 2518
I thought Commandant 
Alexei was a real warrior, 
with an undefeatable spirit... <PAGE>Death will come to anyone...

## POINTER 2519
Well? You don't want to have 
a little fun with me?

## POINTER 2520
We're eventually going to die, right? The least 
we can do is have fun until that happens.

## POINTER 2521
I was wandering through the forest and 
became lost in some old ruins...<PAGE>It was there I heard the 
unnatural howling of 
some frightful beast!

## POINTER 2522
There's no doubt in my mind...it 
was the legendary monster, Euma.

## POINTER 2523
There are still monsters in 
this world even the Hunting 
Blades don't know about.<PAGE>Euma is one of them!

## POINTER 2524
I'll spend the 
rest of my days 
hunting Euma!

## POINTER 2525
Hey you there, you've got 
a book on monsters right,
can you give it to me?<PAGE>What? You can't...

## POINTER 2526
I thought it had 
information on the Euma......<PAGE>What? There's nothing? 
......What a crock!

## POINTER 2527
There are definitely Eumas 
roaming this world!<PAGE>I will find one, and 
then we'll see who'll 
have the last laugh!

## POINTER 2528
Euma is one of them!

## POINTER 2529
That's it! Verily, 
the legendary Euma!

## POINTER 2530
Did you see it?! 
All you fools that 
laughed at me!

## POINTER 2531
Aaaargh! My granddaughter, that little 
hellion! She took my boat out 
on the ocean without asking...<PAGE>...and now the engine's 
busted! She's going to get 
a piece of my mind...

## POINTER 2532
How could I possibly have 
raised a girl who loves 
the sea so much?!

## POINTER 2533
Aifread brought the Don 
and Belius together. That's 
how they became friends.<PAGE>They really respected 
him for that......

## POINTER 2534
Now there's no Don, 
no Belius, no Aifread... ...<PAGE>Ahhh... the grim reaper 
will be coming for these 
old bones soon enough...

## POINTER 2535
My granddaughter never understands how 
dangerous the sea can be, no matter 
how many times I explain it to her.

## POINTER 2536
I have a feeling she won't 
get it until the sea 
eventually kills her.

## POINTER 2537
My fool granddaughter's out on 
the sea again, even though that 
fearsome thing's in the sky.

## POINTER 2538
I can't believe how stubborn she is! She certainly 
doesn't take after anyone in our family.

## POINTER 2539
I wash my hands of her... 
An old man can't overcome 
the passion of youth.<PAGE>She can do whatever she wants...

## POINTER 2540
I can't believe how stubborn 
she is! She certainly doesn't 
take after anyone in our family.

## POINTER 2541
My senile old gramps forgot 
the promise he made to 
let me have his boat!<PAGE>Look, he gave it to me. 
I can do whatever I 
want with it, right?!

## POINTER 2542
I mean, he's the reason 
I love the ocean 
so much anyway...

## POINTER 2543
I mean, it's his fault 
I love the ocean 
so much anyway...

## POINTER 2544
The Don in the north, Belius in 
the south, and the Pirate King, 
Aifread, on the seas.<PAGE>Now all of them 
are gone...

## POINTER 2545
I don't care how dangerous 
it is. I have to do 
what I have to do.

## POINTER 2546
"The sea is dangerous", yeah, 
yeah, I know that much!

## POINTER 2547
My gramps went to 
sea years ago.<PAGE>Why can't I have 
the same freedom...?

## POINTER 2548
Why do I go out on the ocean 
even though gramps doesn't  
approve? To achieve his dreams. <PAGE>I'm going to achieve the 
dreams he had when 
he was a sailor.

## POINTER 2549
I'm going to achieve 
the dreams he had when 
he was a sailor.

## POINTER 2550
No matter how great the danger 
in the sky, I will get out on the sea! <PAGE>I will face up to the danger 
just like a true king of the pirates!

## POINTER 2551
My father and my daughter 
are so quick to argue.<PAGE>I wish they'd just get along...they're 
so alike, those two.

## POINTER 2552
It's not as if they 
really dislike each 
other, you know.

## POINTER 2553
If only they would talk to each 
other... But they're both so stubborn. 
They're always fighting.

## POINTER 2554
My daughter and father
hasn't themselves lately.<PAGE>I wonder if it has anything
to do with the death of
the Don and Belius?

## POINTER 2555
Honestly, I don't care much
for the Don nor Belius.

## POINTER 2556
They're just too embarassed to sit 
down and have a face-to-face.

## POINTER 2557
With things as they are, 
I'm worried about my daughter 
sailing as well...

## POINTER 2558
Not that she's the kind of girl who'd 
ever listen to what I had to say.

## POINTER 2559
Well well, hello again. We met 
at Deidon Hold, didn't we?<PAGE>Have you finally decided 
to work for us?

## POINTER 2560
After we met, the Hold was reopened 
and I was able to get back to town.<PAGE>If it had been even a little later, 
I wouldn't have been able to cross 
the sea because of the storms.

## POINTER 2561
...

## POINTER 2562
You never realize how important 
someone is until they're 
gone, do you?

## POINTER 2563
Now I understand just how hard it'll be 
to fill the hole the Don left behind.

## POINTER 2564
Well, then...it's time for Fortune's 
Market to act like Fortune's 
Market, and earn big!

## POINTER 2565
You can't move forward 
if you keep thinking about 
people lost forever.

## POINTER 2566
The Empire's in a panic right now. 
If we trade smart during the 
aftermath, it'll mean huge profit.

## POINTER 2567
The Knights or His Royal Highness...
Which is the more valuable property? 
I'm considering what to invest in...

## POINTER 2568
With so many strange goings on, it's not 
exactly easy doing business lately.

## POINTER 2569
We've sent relief supplies here and 
there, so we've taken a huge loss.<PAGE>We're going to work together 
to make that money 
back. All right?

## POINTER 2570
When did we 
become a charity 
guild? <PAGE>We've taken huge losses 
sending relief supplies 
for free...

## POINTER 2571
This is Fortune's Market 
headquarters.<PAGE>The President is very 
busy. Don't bother her.

## POINTER 2572
This is Fortune's Market 
headquarters.<PAGE>Stay away from the President. 
You'll only be a bother.

## POINTER 2573
The Don's death has had 
quite an effect on Fortune's 
Market, too.

## POINTER 2574
The president is even busier 
than usual. Don't bother her.

## POINTER 2575
The president is hard at work 
again today. Don't bother her.

## POINTER 2576
Weapons are power, but so are distribution 
and finance. Fortune's Market has 
the power to change the world.

## POINTER 2577
The president is in a good mood today. But 
that doesn't mean you can go bother her.

## POINTER 2578
She may be the president, but 
she helps people out. That's 
what makes her so wonderful.

## POINTER 2579
She isn't the kind of person that 
would demand payback once the 
dust had settled, either.

## POINTER 2580
...This town is so 
nice to live in...<PAGE>The people are kind, the weather not 
too hot, not too cold...and best 
of all...the President is here...

## POINTER 2581
...This will be our little secret, but...<PAGE>...The president 
smells so nice...

## POINTER 2582
I stand at the President's side again today. 
There could be not greater happiness.

## POINTER 2583
...This will be our little secret, but...<PAGE>...The President's clothes make 
her look slimmer than she is.

## POINTER 2584
...This will be our little secret, but...<PAGE>...The President really, really 
hates being called "ma'am".

## POINTER 2585
...This will be our little secret, but...<PAGE>...The President loves money.

## POINTER 2586
...This will be our little secret, but...<PAGE>...The President has no 
intention of every marrying.

## POINTER 2587
President and Chief are 
just different titles. 
They're both bosses.<PAGE>We're proud of the title.

## POINTER 2588
...This will be our little secret, but...<PAGE>...The President never 
takes off her glasses.

## POINTER 2589
This facility is under direct control 
of the Empire. If you don't have 
business here, please move along.

## POINTER 2590
If you're lost, you can reach 
Halure by heading southwest.<PAGE>Traveling south will lead 
you to Deidon Hold.

## POINTER 2591
This is Aspio, the closed 
city of learning.<PAGE>Please produce your passport.

## POINTER 2592
It's unusual for outsiders 
to come to Aspio.<PAGE>All anyone here cares 
about is research.<PAGE>Everyone here is such a loony, 
just standing guard makes me 
think I might lose it myself.

## POINTER 2593
Everyone here is still such a loony, just 
standing guard makes me think I might lose 
it myself. You folk be careful, too.

## POINTER 2594
My colleague beside me here is so devoted 
to his duties, but sometimes you 
just want to take a breather.

## POINTER 2595
The skies over in the direction 
of Zaphias look so strange.<PAGE>I wonder if everything's all right?

## POINTER 2596
We haven't received any 
orders from Zaphias... What's 
happened to the Knights?

## POINTER 2597
Ooh, leave me be! How am I supposed 
to conduct my research with all 
of you loitering about? Go away!

## POINTER 2598
Ooh, can't you leave me alone?! 
Just a little bit more...just...don't 
talk to me! I can't think!

## POINTER 2599
Ooh, can't you just leave me alone?! 
What do you need now?! This 
is the most important step!!
