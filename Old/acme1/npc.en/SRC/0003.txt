## POINTER 300
The throne has been empty for 
some time, but a successor 
will soon sit upon it. <PAGE>If only the Imperial Knights 
weren't supporting their own aspirant, 
the throne would be occupied.

## POINTER 301
The Council and the 
Knights support different 
candidates for emperor. <PAGE>Honestly, I don't 
care who wins.

## POINTER 302
The Commandant is a 
fool to think he could 
simply become emperor. <PAGE>Well, I never thought he 
would succeed anyway.

## POINTER 303
The Council spared no 
effort to avert this danger, 
but to no avail... <PAGE>And the Commandant 
has fled as well.

## POINTER 304
The Council members 
are on the brink of despair. <PAGE>However the flame of 
hope will not be 
extinguished so easily.

## POINTER 305
Everything will be all right 
if Alexei is brought down. <PAGE>I'm not particularly worried.

## POINTER 306
Is that...the Adephagos? 
Surely not...

## POINTER 307
Even if that were the Adephagos... 
Someone would save us... 
I think.

## POINTER 308
There was a massive shock 
as clouds of sand drifted 
up in the north... <PAGE>And then, the mountain 
to the north was gone...

## POINTER 309
Judging by the direction, 
the mountain that fell must 
have been near Aspio.

## POINTER 310
Hey! 
You!

## POINTER 311
You don't think 
you can draw 
water here, do you?<PAGE>You commoners are 
so rude and greedy. Go 
back from where you came.

## POINTER 312
You're not the bandit 
who broke into the 
mansion, are you? <PAGE>We assume commoners in the 
royal quarter are thieves. 
If you don't like it, don't come.

## POINTER 313
Don't walk around here 
in such shabby clothes!<PAGE>You ruin the grace of this city! 
Return to the lower areas at once!

## POINTER 314
You think you're going 
to wash your dog now?<PAGE>How dare you bring that filthy animal 
here! What's a commoner like you doing 
with your own dog, anyway? Such audacity!

## POINTER 315
Have you heard? They say unusual 
noises are coming from one of 
the empty mansions lately. <PAGE>I'd like to report it to 
the Knights, but as it's 
nothing more than a rumor...

## POINTER 316
I imagine one of those 
lowly commoners has broken 
in to steal something. <PAGE>This is no place for low 
folk to dawdle. Do you 
understand what I'm saying?

## POINTER 317
The wretched thief that 
broke into that manor 
has been caught!<PAGE>Well, I would like to 
think I did my part to 
keep the capital safe.

## POINTER 318
I saw the scoundrel break 
into the mansion and 
reported it to the Knights. <PAGE>Captain Cumore took 
care of him.

## POINTER 319
Once I informed the Knights, 
they were kind enough to 
pay me a small reward. <PAGE>Not that I can buy 
much of value with 
100,000 Gald.

## POINTER 320
Oh! Someone will inform 
the Knights if you loiter 
here much longer.

## POINTER 321
The mansion near the lake? 
Everyone's talking about it. <PAGE>The house is supposed to be 
empty, but people have seen 
lights shining at night.

## POINTER 322
Perhaps someone 
bought it? <PAGE>The mansion is quite spacious... 
Another of the nobles 
might be moving in.

## POINTER 323
A thief broke into that 
mansion a little while ago. <PAGE>So many Knights 
came to arrest him! 
I was so surprised!

## POINTER 324
...But you know 
...You look...<PAGE>No... He must be in the 
castle dungeons now. 
You couldn't...

## POINTER 325
That mansion has been 
quiet ever since that 
business with the thief. <PAGE>I wonder what that light 
in the window was...

## POINTER 326
I wonder if a thief has 
taken up residence there...

## POINTER 327
After the thief was caught 
those noises stopped 
coming from the mansion. <PAGE>People have stopped talking 
about it, too. I suppose it 
really was empty all along.

## POINTER 328
Even so, they say 
the thief escaped. 
How frightening...

## POINTER 329
Oh no... You came 
all the way here? 
Oh well...

## POINTER 330
You came for 
water, right? <PAGE>Now hurry up and 
go back to wherever 
you came from.

## POINTER 331
Do you plan to sneak 
into the mansion like 
that thief earlier? <PAGE>I swear, turn over any 
rock and out crawls 
a filthy thief.

## POINTER 332
You should be happy 
if you could live in that mansion.<PAGE>There's nothing 
in it now though...

## POINTER 333
You want money 
this badly? 
Money grubber.

## POINTER 334
I'm soooo in love with 
Captain Cumore of the 
Imperial Knights!∀<PAGE>I wish he was my boyfriend. 
He looks so hot when he's 
crushing those commoners!

## POINTER 335
I wonder if Captain Cumore
would come running if 
I called for help right now?♪

## POINTER 336
Listen, listen!☆ 
Captain Cumore captured some 
lower quarter scum!∀<PAGE>Oooh! 
I'm so excited!

## POINTER 337
That's my dear 
Cumore!<PAGE>He's my first choice 
for a boyfriend.☆

## POINTER 338
Commandant Alexei of 
the Imperial Knights 
came here a while back.<PAGE>He is soooo hot!

## POINTER 339
The Commandant was with a blonde 
kid he called "Your Highness". 
I don't remember much about him. <PAGE>I don't have time for scrawny little 
mama's boys!☆

## POINTER 340
Everyone's going on 
about the weather, but 
it's not that big a deal.<PAGE>The sky just changed a little. 
I'm much more interested in 
the new captain, <STR>(FRE).♪

## POINTER 341
<STR>(FRE)'s a social climber from 
the lower quarter, but he's 
actually really cool!♪<PAGE>I heard there's a fan club: the 
Defense Force. I'm curious, but I 
don't know... Mixing with the poor...

## POINTER 342
I grit my teeth and 
joined the <STR>(FRE)
Defense Force. <PAGE>The lower girls may not be 
very refined, but they're nice. 
Not so bad, actually.

## POINTER 343
Everything just went, like, 
so bad after I joined the 
Defense Force.<PAGE>I wonder where 
everyone went?

## POINTER 344
The royal quarter
has many blastia.<PAGE>It seems like most 
nobles don't really care 
about blastia.

## POINTER 345
They seem to think 
they can just buy 
a new one if it breaks.

## POINTER 346
It seems like that 
mansion was being 
used for something. <PAGE>I heard a young man found out 
and snuck in, but then he 
was captured by the Knights.

## POINTER 347
Maybe I should have followed 
up with the Knights and 
cleared him of the charges...

## POINTER 348
No one really knows 
the value of blastia.<PAGE>I think we need to let 
more people know just 
how important they are.

## POINTER 349
It would be nice 
if we could actually create 
blastia by ourselves again.

## POINTER 350
Blastia provide invaluable 
benefits to the quality 
of peoples' lives.<PAGE>I intend to help the humans 
so that they may utilize blastia 
even more effectively.

## POINTER 351
Tools exist 
to be used.<PAGE>Don't you feel pity for all the 
blastia buried beneath the 
earth, completely forgotten?

## POINTER 352
There was nothing 
I could do.

## POINTER 353
I came to the capital to atone 
for the sins of the race that 
brought blastia unto this world. <PAGE>I was so certain 
that blastia was 
being used safely...

## POINTER 354
The disturbance in 
the aer seems to 
have quieted, but...<PAGE>Have we truly 
escaped danger...?

## POINTER 355
If the legends of 
the Kritya are true...

## POINTER 356
What is that...? 
It's vile...

## POINTER 357
Part of the monster in the sky 
fell to the ground somewhere. <PAGE>It was huge... If there were 
a town under it, it would 
surely have been crushed.

## POINTER 358
A tower appeared around 
where the mountain in 
the north vanished.

## POINTER 359
What could that tower be? <PAGE>I've never heard 
of such a thing.

## POINTER 360
You there! 
This exit is for 
nobles only.<PAGE>Common rabble like you 
should use the exit 
in the lower quarter.

## POINTER 361
No no no. I don't care if you're 
desperate. Try again when you 
are of the proper status. <PAGE>You would have no problem 
if you were, say, the Commandant 
of the Knights. Hah hah hah!

## POINTER 362
Were you the commoners 
arrested recently for breaking 
into that empty mansion?<PAGE>I won't let you get away. 
No no no.

## POINTER 363
This exit is for nobles 
only. Well, carriages and 
whatnot as well. <PAGE>I'm sorry, but you 
commoners cannot pass.

## POINTER 364
It may not be much, 
but I managed to escape 
with my products.

## POINTER 365
呼店出

## POINTER 366
Sorry to ask for your Gald at 
such a trying time. I still have 
to run a business, you know.

## POINTER 367
And to think <STR>(EST) was actually a 
princess... I guess now I should 
say, "Her Highness <STR>(EST)". <PAGE>She always did have a refined 
air about her...sort of reminded 
me of my grandmother.

## POINTER 368
You must rescue 
<STR>(EST)...I mean, 
Her Highness.

## POINTER 369
Those knights...<STR>(YUR), 
they're the ones that were 
bullying you, aren't they?<PAGE>I was surprised they 
turned out to be so nice.

## POINTER 370
I wonder if <STR>(FRE) will 
come to help us, too...

## POINTER 371
We'd already be out 
of Zaphias if all 
this hadn't happened. <PAGE>If only we'd set out a 
little earlier, we wouldn't 
be trapped here...

## POINTER 372
I do think this will be a 
valuable experience...if we 
get out of the castle, that is.

## POINTER 373
I thought we were about to set 
off on a grand journey, and then 
all this had to happen...<PAGE>I suppose I'll spend my time 
here quizzing my new friend 
about his travel knowledge.

## POINTER 374
I pray that the world we 
eventually get to see on our 
journey is a more peaceful one.

## POINTER 375
I lost my glasses somewhere 
along the way while we were 
escaping here...<PAGE>First the dentures, now my glasses! 
Guess I'm good at losing things. 
What a bother.

## POINTER 376
Mmm...? Hey wait... 
Now that I think about it, 
I don't even wear glasses.

## POINTER 377
If our town ever gets back to normal, I'm 
going to found the <STR>(YUR) Defense Force.<PAGE>Why? Just look at you, 
<STR>(YUR)! You're so...shiny 
and wonderful!

## POINTER 378
And I'll be the 
brilliant Defense Force 
member number 1!

## POINTER 379
I became friends with those 
two knights-the tall, skinny one 
and the short, fat one. <PAGE>They might be full 
of themselves, but 
they're nice guys.

## POINTER 380
You see, you see, I say, I say!
...That's my impression of 
beanpole and porky.

## POINTER 381
I had to leave all my wares 
back in town... I'm really 
worried about looters. <PAGE>Of course, with the state the 
lower quarter's in, I suppose 
nobody can really get near it.

## POINTER 382
My dear wife got out of the city, 
but I just hope she's all right...

## POINTER 383
I always thought the Knights were 
a bunch of nasty losers. I mean, 
other than you and <STR>(FRE), <STR>(YUR).<PAGE>It was a little surpising to 
find out a lot of them 
really had a backbone.

## POINTER 384
Compared to them, all the 
Knights following that so-called 
Commandant look like fools.

## POINTER 385
Everyone needs to eat to 
regain their strength, especially 
at a time like this. <PAGE>No matter what happens, 
this is still a restaurant. 
Now it's my turn to shine!

## POINTER 386
Everyone, everyone! 
Lend me a hand! 
Let's cook up a feast!

## POINTER 387
<STR>(YUR), if you're going through 
tough times, you can always tell 
this old lady about it. <PAGE>It's the only way I can repay 
you for all you've done for us.

## POINTER 388
What happened to the young lady 
you were with before? Oh my, is 
this your new girlfriend? <PAGE>If you're mixed up in a 
love triangle, you can always 
talk to me about it.

## POINTER 389
Commandant Alexei seemed 
like such an upstanding man, 
but it was only an act. <PAGE>When an empire's top commander 
goes mad, it's hard not to think 
that empire's about to fall.

## POINTER 390
Even if countries fall, mountains 
and rivers will remain...as will 
the people that live upon them. <PAGE>When you think about it 
that way, perhaps there's 
no reason for despair...

## POINTER 391
I can't talk.

## POINTER 392
I'm calling a provisional 
truce! But we'll bring you in 
as soon as this is over!<PAGE>...We're counting on you... 
Stop the Commandant.

## POINTER 393
...I'll never forgive you if you 
tarnish the good names of the 
Captain or the Princess, though!

## POINTER 394
<STR>(YUR), what are you 
still doing here?<PAGE>You're a young man! 
Hurry up and go give 
old man Hanks some help.

## POINTER 395
We'd like to 
help out, too, but 
we're needed here.

## POINTER 396
Hey! What are you going 
just wandering around?!<PAGE>The Knights are after you!

## POINTER 397
<STR>(YUR)! 
You...<PAGE>What have you done?!

## POINTER 398
Sir Leblanc might have left, 
but Knights still come 
around on their pilgrimages. <PAGE>You should leave quick.

## POINTER 399
Hey! What do you 
think you're doing?!
