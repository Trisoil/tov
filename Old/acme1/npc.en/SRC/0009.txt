## POINTER 900
We'll protect this town 
no matter what may come!

## POINTER 901
The craftsmens' skill sure 
is impressive, isn't it? Just look 
at the houses they've built.

## POINTER 902
We've built this town, 
now we need to defend it.

## POINTER 903
All that hard work paying off, 
and the town looking so nice... 
Really makes you happy, doesn't it?

## POINTER 904
I'd completely forgotten 
this feeling.

## POINTER 905
It wasn't easy building the town 
up so nice, but we have a real 
sense of accomplishment now.

## POINTER 906
This has really 
become a great place.

## POINTER 907
I just knew following 
<STR>(FRE) was the 
right thing to do!

## POINTER 908
This has gotta be the 
funnest town on earth!

## POINTER 909
I was worried at first, 
but we have a pretty 
full life here.<PAGE>Whaddya think? 
How's 'bout startin' 
up a farm with me?

## POINTER 910
It's so much fun! Like a 
million flowers blooming inside 
my head! ♪ Everything'll work out!

## POINTER 911
This is both a hospital and just 
a place to rest! Y'wanna spend the 
night? It'll only cost 100 Gald.

## POINTER 912
Welcome! We have quite 
a well-rounded selection 
of products now.

## POINTER 913
Thank you very much!∀

## POINTER 914
Ah, welcome! I just started 
helping out here, and before I 
knew it I was left in charge!

## POINTER 915
Isn't hard work great? 
Come back any time!

## POINTER 916
Apprentices do not become 
masters in a day.

## POINTER 917
Neither are towns 
built in a day.

## POINTER 918
Step right up! Feast your eyes 
on these wares! You can't buy 
stuff like this in the Empire!

## POINTER 919
Step right up! Come one, 
come all! Feast your 
eyes on these wares!

## POINTER 920
R-running away now would be an insult 
to merchants everywhere! Business is 
life! You got a problem with that?!

## POINTER 921
You got a problem 
with that?!! 
Huh?!! Huh?!!

## POINTER 922
The Don's amazing. I mean, to 
get all those guilds together and 
take out that many monsters...

## POINTER 923
This town's safe as long 
as the Don is around. 
Anyway, back to work!

## POINTER 924
Step right up! Feast your 
eyes on these wares!
See a real salesman in action!

## POINTER 925
Anything is possible, as 
long as you have spirit!

## POINTER 926
Step right up! Feast your eyes on 
these wares! We got a sale in honor 
of the treaty with the Empire!

## POINTER 927
"Keep selling, no matter what!" 
That's our motto!

## POINTER 928
I don't care if monsters attack! 
I don't care if there's a guild war! 
Real men shut up and sell!

## POINTER 929
Wait.... 
The Don did what?!<PAGE>No way... 
That's impossible...

## POINTER 930
Shut up! Don't talk to me 
right now! You think I can 
sell at a time like this?!

## POINTER 931
*Sigh*... Step right up... 
Feast your eyes 
on these wares...

## POINTER 932
I think I lost
my motivation somewhere.

## POINTER 933
In times of trouble a 
salesman's gotta make the 
effort to be extra cheerful!

## POINTER 934
Step right up! 
Feast your eyes 
on these wares!

## POINTER 935
Dahngrest is a city of 
guilds. It's probably the 
freest place on earth!♪

## POINTER 936
All those stuffy, old Empire
types should go back and huddle 
together on their own turf.♪

## POINTER 937
Wh-what?! 
What's going on?!

## POINTER 938
Hey, we've got to get out of 
here! Just don't break any of 
my merchandise on the way out!

## POINTER 939
Dahngrest is the best! With 
all the guilds banded together, 
monsters are no match for us! ♪

## POINTER 940
Those Empire types better 
not underestimate us.

## POINTER 941
We'll never lose to the Empire!

## POINTER 942
Hey, that knight... 
He's pretty cute, isn't he...? 
...What? I say something wrong?

## POINTER 943
L-look, it's not like 
I have a crush on him 
or anything, all right?!

## POINTER 944
Ragou's a piece of crap! Everyone 
from the Empire is. Just hearing 
about the Council disgusts me.

## POINTER 945
Nobody from the Empire
has any sense of justice.

## POINTER 946
Now the Empire
finally realizes who 
they're dealing with.

## POINTER 947
What the hell?! Why is 
Dahngrest getting so 
much heat right now?!

## POINTER 948
We didn't do anything!

## POINTER 949
Things were really, really bad!<PAGE>The bridge broke, the town was in 
shambles... But everyone pitched 
in to put it all back together!

## POINTER 950
Things were really, really bad!

## POINTER 951
The Don's dead...? 
Can you believe it? What's 
going to happen now...?

## POINTER 952
What's going to happen now...?

## POINTER 953
I hear the Empire's in trouble. I 
bet all the nobles ran away just 
left the commoners there to suffer.

## POINTER 954
It's unbelievable 
how untrustworthy the 
Empire types are.

## POINTER 955
Isn't that red sky disgusting? 
It's totally disgusting, right? 
What's going on? Seriously!

## POINTER 956
What's going on? Seriously!

## POINTER 957
This is the end...<PAGE>I hear there's a flying city on 
the other continent, and with the 
sky like that... It's all over!

## POINTER 958
It's over... 
It's all over...

## POINTER 959
Sir... You might want to stop 
goggling at everything. It's obvious 
you're not from around here.

## POINTER 960
I don't know where you're 
from, but not everyone in 
Dahngrest is nice.

## POINTER 961
...H-help! 
M-my legs won't move...!

## POINTER 962
S-sir... 
Please help me...

## POINTER 963
Say, you heard the news? It's just 
a rumor, but they say the Empire's 
behind the monster attacks.

## POINTER 964
It's still just a rumor.

## POINTER 965
The knight who came here 
acting all tough is in prison? 
Serves him right.

## POINTER 966
Gotta stock up on all 
sorts of stuff before 
the Empire attacks...

## POINTER 967
I always thought Barbos
was suspicious. Really!

## POINTER 968
Really, really!

## POINTER 969
Some knight named 
<STR>(FRE) was the one who 
captured Ragou?<PAGE>Huh. Maybe the Knights
can be trusted...

## POINTER 970
Maybe the Knights
can be trusted...

## POINTER 971
Hey, hey... Have you heard? 
The Empire's coming! Are 
we gonna be all right?

## POINTER 972
Are we gonna be all right?

## POINTER 973
What the hell is that thing? 
That giant...thing! Hey, this isn't 
funny! People are gonna die!

## POINTER 974
This isn't funny! 
People are gonna die!

## POINTER 975
Palestralle is just 
one guild, right?<PAGE>They don't stand a chance against 
the knowledge and power of 
all the guilds of the Union.

## POINTER 976
Don Whitehorse leads 
the Union! No one stands 
a chance against him.

## POINTER 977
What's the Don sitting 
down there for?<PAGE>He's not giving in to 
the enemy, is he? He 
wouldn't just give up...

## POINTER 978
I can't believe it... 
The Don would 
never give in...

## POINTER 979
This city's finished... 
The guilds won't cooperate 
without the Don...

## POINTER 980
The guilds won't cooperate 
without the Don...

## POINTER 981
Something's wrong with the 
barrier in Zaphias, huh? The 
Empire has it pretty rough, too.

## POINTER 982
We've got our problems, 
but the Empire has 
it pretty rough, too.

## POINTER 983
Business? Now? The sky is like 
this all over the entire world, 
right? So it's not safe anywhere?

## POINTER 984
Doesn't that mean 
it's not safe anywhere?

## POINTER 985
