Treasure Fishing is a game 
in which you reel in treasure 
by pulling on strings.<PAGE>You'd be surpised at all the 
things you can reel in!

## POINTER 1806
Some people pull up 
things that aren't 
really treasure.<PAGE>Of course, that's part 
of what makes Treasure 
Fishing so fun.

## POINTER 1807
Isn't okonomiyaki 
delicious?<PAGE>I'm afraid there's no rice 
to go along with it.

Mix up all kinds of ingredients 
and grill it up juicy-hot!♪<PAGE>Mmmm...pour on 
some thick sauce... 
Magnifique!∀

In the market for a new pet? Why 
not try Goldfish-Scooping?<PAGE>You get to take home as 
many as you can scoop up!

Too bad you're not a reporter. You'd 
get the real "scoop" here!<PAGE>I kid, 
I kid.

the Mask Corner.<PAGE>Perhaps you'll find 
a mask you like!

## POINTER 1813
Step right up to the Shooting Gallery! 
If you can knock a prize down with a 
cork bullet, you get to take it home!<PAGE>Just knocking them over isn't 
enough, though. You have 
to make a prize fall.

## POINTER 1814
Hey, if you try and use any 
of the cork bullets on the ground 
you're paying a fine!<PAGE>I'm watching like 
a hawk! There'll be 
no cheating here.

our secret ingredient.<PAGE>I'll have to go find some more...

## POINTER 1821
Try not to eat too 
much, or play too 
hard. I'm a doctor. <PAGE>If something happens, 
I'd be happy to 
examine you.

## POINTER 1822
It's such a bore being 
in the infirmary. I'd really 
rather be outside.<PAGE>*Sigh*...I wish I could go 
out and have fun with you.

## POINTER 1823
Isn't this a wonderful place? 
It's so fun! There's so

This thing on my 
head--it's made of 
real filifolia.

## POINTER 1828
Well, I said that but 
I didn't cut it by myself. <PAGE>I just picked it up from
behind the gym 
where it was just laying there.

## POINTER 1829
What are the Kowz and 
Antlionz, anyway...? <PAGE>They're so different 
from Kritya.

We're all about the same 
height...does than mean 
they're kids, too?<PAGE>I'd like to make friends with 
them, since I'm here anyway.

## POINTER 1831
It's a little hard to believe 
there's a facility like this 
on such a remote island.<PAGE>It's got a great atmosphere 
and themed so well.

## POINTER 1832
The nicest time on this 
island is just when the 
sun's about to set.

## POINTER 1833
This bug costume really 
suits me, doesn't it?<PAGE>It took so long 
to make!

## POINTER 1834
Oh, I can tell. You're 
wearing a costume, 
too, right?<PAGE>I'd love to 
try it on!∀

## POINTER 1835
See that over there? 
It's a Rappig statue.<PAGE>They say it was made 
to celebrate the 100th 
anniversary.

I'm going to arrest you if you 
keep ignoring my warnings! 
Get outta here already!

Why did our wagon break 
down? It's obvious. 
Someone tampered with it.<PAGE>Maybe we should round up 
the citizens and smoke 
the perpetrator out...

## POINTER 1874
Bring 'em on! We'll show them 
just how stupid it is to pick 
a fight with the Knights.

## POINTER 1875
The soldier's just 
standing there watching 
the shopkeeper...<PAGE>He's not moving at all... 
Maybe he's asleep?

## POINTER 1876
...Just talking to myself!

Wait a minute. 
This soldier's not 
moving at all... <PAGE>Maybe there's nobody 
even inside that armor...?

Keep trying my patience and 
I'll throw you in jail. 
Out, out!

You all have been loitering around 
here for a while... Keep it up, and 
I'll toss you all in the slammer.

It wasn't necessary 
to speak to the kids 
so harshly...<PAGE>I wonder if they think 
the same of me as they 
do those those Knights.

## POINTER 1891
Wh-who are you people? 
I mean, those guys just took off!

Ugh! Why'd I have to come 
all the way out to this 
godforsaken place?<PAGE>Of course, it was on our boss' 
orders. Something's up... I'll have 
to grab some of his leftovers.

Dammit! Now I gotta 
do wagon repair?

I can't put up 
with this anymore.<PAGE>Why the hell do we have 
to keep watch on the citizens 
in a place like this?
