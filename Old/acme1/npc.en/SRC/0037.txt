## POINTER 3700
Oh! <STR>(YUR)! Did you finish 
talking with <STR>(FRE)? <PAGE>It's me! I joined the 
same time you all did! 
Hey...

## POINTER 3701
Hey, I saw your 
friends just wandering 
around over there.<PAGE>Oh...hey! There's a guy 
with you that looks just 
like Captain Schwann.<PAGE>He said to put him 
in jail, so I did. 
Kinda wierd, huh?<PAGE>Oh yeah, I caught 
that guy before, too. 
So it was like...<PAGE>Sorry. 
I'll shut up now.

## POINTER 3702
The Royal Guard were the 
best of the best, hand 
picked by Alexei himself.<PAGE>How could it become 
just a cult to worship 
Alexei...?

## POINTER 3703
Even <STR>(FRE), the acting 
commandant, got 
tricked by Alexei.

## POINTER 3704
Most of the Royal Guard 
stayed in the capital
instead of going to Zaude.<PAGE>But they got branded 
as traitors anyway. 
They're hating life now.

## POINTER 3705
My friend was one of them. 
Poor guy.

## POINTER 3706
I will protect the 
peace and saftey 
of Zaphias Castle! <PAGE>I will not allow 
anyone to perpetrate 
injustice!

## POINTER 3707
The Knights should always be the 
primary servants of the people!

## POINTER 3708
Uhhh... I feel sick... 
I am so done with 
being a knight...

## POINTER 3709
And with what Alexei
did, nobody respects 
Knights anymore.

## POINTER 3710
Well, I guess joining a group 
like this and getting so much power 
would make anyone crazy. <PAGE>I mean, I don't even know about 
Acting Commandant <STR>(FRE). 
That position, as young as he is...?

## POINTER 3711
<STR>(FRE)... 
He's so innocent. 
Poor thing. <PAGE>I'm afraid that won't 
last very long...

## POINTER 3712
I don't wanna work 
with the Royal Guard. <PAGE>You never know when 
they'll stab you in the back. 
I mean, they're all traitors.

## POINTER 3713
I'll pass on working with 
lowlifes that'll stab you 
in the back anytime.

## POINTER 3714
I don't know 
what to believe. <PAGE>I was brought up thinking the 
Knights were just group 
that protected the country.

## POINTER 3715
What is justice?<PAGE>I wonder if I can 
live by my own 
sense of justice.

## POINTER 3716
I am standing here 
in the midst of an 
exciting, historic time. <PAGE>So much chaos in the 
capital! So much danger! 
My heart's racing!

## POINTER 3717
History is happening all 
around us. Doesn't that 
make you a little happy?

## POINTER 3718
No matter what sort of 
crisis we may face, I believe 
there is always a solution.

## POINTER 3719
Why, you ask? 
Well, we've survived 
this long, haven't we?

## POINTER 3720
We must protect 
the Tree of Halure, 
no matter what. <PAGE>That Tree is 
our very hope...

## POINTER 3721
I'm ready to 
fight to protect 
the Tree of Halure.

## POINTER 3722
I thought this city would 
be okay as long as 
there was a barrier. <PAGE>Maybe we relied 
too much on blastia.

## POINTER 3723
We should have realized it 
then, but... Oh well. We'll 
keep fighting on.

## POINTER 3724
The falling flowers 
are ever-present, but 
never twice the same. <PAGE>"Petals flutter upon the wind, 
never lingering long..."

## POINTER 3725
...So it is with all the 
flocks of man on earth.

## POINTER 3726
Maybe illness does 
follow the mind...<PAGE>You can think your 
way to health, right? <PAGE>...Or not. 
Am I sick? 
I feel terrible.

## POINTER 3727
Illness follows the mind... 
I hear thinking that way 
will cure almost anything. <PAGE>Yeah, that's a lie.

## POINTER 3728
If I could use high blastia magic, 
I'd blow those monsters away 
in one shot...<PAGE>O-of course, 
it's only a fantasy...

## POINTER 3729
I'd love to 
study blastia...

## POINTER 3730
Welcome to the historic old 
Denebola, where even 
His Highness Ioder stayed! <PAGE>Come on, stay a night!

## POINTER 3731
Just a little bit ago, 
His Highness Ioder
stayed with us! <PAGE>That's amazing, isn't it! 
I got his autograph.

## POINTER 3732
...You gotta be 
tired too... <PAGE>Stay a while at the 
historic old Denebola...
...I'm tired...

## POINTER 3733
I'm so tired...
I wonder why...

## POINTER 3734
Fate is something for 
the heavens to deal with.

## POINTER 3735
We must simply 
live as ourselves. 
That is happiness.

## POINTER 3736
...I don't feel too good... 
I wonder why...<PAGE>It all started after 
that tower appeared...

## POINTER 3737
I want to lie down... 
I can't stop thinking 
about that tower...

## POINTER 3738
*Meooowâˆ€*

## POINTER 3739
*Mew mew*

## POINTER 3740
*Woof woof*

## POINTER 3741
*Woooof*

## POINTER 3742
I was so relieved 
when I saw this town's 
Tree in the distance. <PAGE>It was like all the 
chaos in the capital 
was just a bad dream.

## POINTER 3743
I feel so sorry for a 
friend of mine who 
was late escaping... <PAGE>Why couldn't 
I help him...?

## POINTER 3744
It was horrible... 
So many people...<PAGE>The smoke still followed us, 
no matter how much we ran. 
I can't believe I'm still alive.

## POINTER 3745
I can still see the 
terrible light, every 
time I close my eyes. <PAGE>I don't think I'll 
ever forget this.

## POINTER 3746
I might have fled the 
capital, but I still want 
to go back someday. <PAGE>I can't just let it go after 
living so long there...

## POINTER 3747
They say home is where the 
heart is, but my heart will 
always be in that city.

## POINTER 3748
Oh! 
What horror! <PAGE>Red mist, weeds just 
tangling over everything... 
What happened?

## POINTER 3749
We just barely escaped 
with our lives! <PAGE>I thought we 
were done for!

## POINTER 3750
I plan on going to Nor
Harbor for refuge, but 
what about after that? <PAGE>I guess I could cross the ocean 
to Heliord, the city for nobles... 
Yeah, I think I'll go there.

## POINTER 3751
I'm done with the capital. 
Done. I'm leaving it 
for better lands.

## POINTER 3752
This town's boring. 
There's nothing to do. <PAGE>Flowers? You seen one, 
you seen them all. 
*Sigh* Booooring...

## POINTER 3753
I want to go back to 
Zaphias... But I don't know, 
after all that happened.

## POINTER 3754
The trip from the capital sure 
takes its toll on these old bones. 
And the monsters... <PAGE>But I should happy to be alive, 
with the capital the way it is...

## POINTER 3755
Are you going to the capital? 
You really shouldn't. 
It's like going there to die.

## POINTER 3756
Even though I've been told 
that I have attention issues, 
I've got great hearing!

## POINTER 3757
I poured sauce 
on your friends 
and ate 'em! <PAGE>...Just kidding.

## POINTER 3758
I haven't seen them. They 
haven't come this way. There's 
nothing up ahead either.

## POINTER 3759
Why don't you people use 
your blastia to kill that monster?

## POINTER 3760
What's the point of having 
blastia if you don't use 
them at a time like this?

## POINTER 3761
If you guys won't take 
care of the Adephagos I'll 
take it out myself!

## POINTER 3762
The Adephagos is 
nothing compared to me.

## POINTER 3763
This stuff has been here 
in the city for ages. 
Would you like to have it? <PAGE>I'll trade you 
Gald coins for it.

## POINTER 3764
Please come back if you have 
any other needs. We have no 
use for any of these things.

## POINTER 3765
Oh, look! <STR>(JUD) is with 
you too? Do you remember 
me? It's me, me...

## POINTER 3766
You left this city without 
really getting to know it.

## POINTER 3767
Oh, what was that noise? 
I was so surprised. <PAGE>I've never heard such 
a loud noise in my life!

## POINTER 3768
This city's always so quiet. 
We never hear loud 
noises like that here.

## POINTER 3769
Oh, I heard your 
friends disappeared... <PAGE>Aren't they just hiding 
around here somewhere?

## POINTER 3770
I've been searching 
but haven't found them.

## POINTER 3771
Oh, <STR>(JUD)! 
Do you remember me? 
It's me, me...

## POINTER 3772
Didn't we 
just meet? <PAGE>That's right. 
I remember.

## POINTER 3773
<STR>(JUD), remember? 
I used to invite 
you out to play. <PAGE>But you liked to be 
alone, reading books 
or practicing fighting.

## POINTER 3774
You said that 
you didn't like our 
casual attitude? <PAGE>But, you're pretty easy 
going yourself, <STR>(JUD).

## POINTER 3775
Why don't you come back, 
<STR>(JUD)? Doesn't the 
human world tire you out? <PAGE>That's what Tort
said when he came 
back a while ago.

## POINTER 3776
To think this city, without 
blastia, is easier to live in than 
the human world. How strange...

## POINTER 3777
I am the warehouse keeper.

## POINTER 3778
We are not yet 
open for business.

## POINTER 3779
Yesterday, we had a 
serious discussion about 
our future until morning... <PAGE>Actually, we got sidetracked a 
number of times... 
That's why it took till monring...

## POINTER 3780
We had a meeting last 
night that lasted until this 
morning. I'm so tired...

## POINTER 3781
That old man... I swear... 
He lets anyone in the house. <PAGE>That's why 
they say old people 
aren't vigilant.

## POINTER 3782
Don't think that 
the old man's 
accepted you!

## POINTER 3783
That old man is my old man. 
I'm that only one that can ask 
about the legendary cucumber. <PAGE>Don't you go asking about it!

## POINTER 3784
I'm going to be the next 
Elder! Me! You got that?!

## POINTER 3785
I was told not to call 
the old man, "old man". <PAGE>Even though he's an old man...

## POINTER 3786
I have to call the old man 
"elder" from tomorrow. 
That stupid old man...

## POINTER 3787
We're using this river 
to transport supplies.

## POINTER 3788
This is really an 
excellent location.

## POINTER 3789
Y'know, this work is the only 
peace I get all day, away from 
my wife's constant whining.<PAGE>I wonder when she'll 
finally get used to 
this environment...

## POINTER 3790
I wait for the supplies to 
be transported here, and 
then carry them into town.

## POINTER 3791
Listen! My husband's off 
working, I don't have any fun, 
or do any shopping. Nothing!<PAGE>I'm bored to death! 
I want pasta for lunch! I want 
to act more like a woman!

## POINTER 3792
I want to go...back...
to...Zaphias!!! 
NOW!!!

## POINTER 3793
Whaddya mean, blastia are 
gonna stop working?!<PAGE>We're defenseless 
without blastia! 
We'll die without blastia!

## POINTER 3794
I want to go...back...to...
Zaphias... Wait... There's 
no blastia there either...

## POINTER 3795
Gonna build houses! 
Make everyone happy!

## POINTER 3796
Gotta hurry up and build, 
get everyone smilin'!

## POINTER 3797
We're starting from scratch, right? 
Now this should be a construction 
job with a little challenge!

## POINTER 3798
This is the kinda job that 
sets a craftsman's soul 
on fire, I'm tellin' ya!

## POINTER 3799
When there's no more blastia, 
we guild craftsman will 
really show what we're made of!<PAGE>We've gotta show 'em that 
the world can still survive 
even without blastia!
