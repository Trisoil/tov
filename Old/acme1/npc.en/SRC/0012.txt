## POINTER 1200
A huge tower appeared 
toward Zaphias, and Aspio
got crushed, right?<PAGE>I wonder if Zaphias is 
all right. Scary, scary...

## POINTER 1201
Oh, this is so irritating...! I want 
to go home! I want to go home!
I want to get back to Zaphias...

## POINTER 1202
I live in this city 
and help out with 
various guild jobs.

## POINTER 1203
I love being able to 
interact with so many 
different people.

## POINTER 1204
I-I have lived in this town 
for many a year, but I have 
never seen the barrier fail!!

## POINTER 1205
B-but this town is my 
town! I-I shall strive to 
protect it with my life!

## POINTER 1206
I am so pleased the 
barrier is back in operation! 
Now we can rest easy.

## POINTER 1207
Of course they're angry here. 
This town was built by people 
wronged by the Empire.

## POINTER 1208
Fights even happen between 
the guilds themselves.

## POINTER 1209
Why do people fight...?

## POINTER 1210
Things here in Dahngrest
are finally back to normal.

## POINTER 1211
I love this city.

## POINTER 1212
I love it when this 
city's filled with people's 
laughter and voices.<PAGE>The fighting has 
stopped and things 
have calmed down.

## POINTER 1213
I'm so glad that 
peace has returned...

## POINTER 1214
A lot of things have 
happened in this city.<PAGE>It just goes to show 
that life's not all 
fun and games.

## POINTER 1215
Life's not always fun. 
That is the biggest 
dilemma with living.

## POINTER 1216
Everyone's worried 
that people will start 
fighting each other again.

## POINTER 1217
Whose blood will flow...? 
How much this time...?

## POINTER 1218
I knew of no other 
man like the Don.
It's such a great loss.

## POINTER 1219
It's such a great loss.
Don... Rest in peace...

## POINTER 1220
I believe the blastia brought 
about the catastrophe 
Zaphias is facing.

## POINTER 1221
Is the aer going 
out of control? 
What's going on?

## POINTER 1222
Wait... That monster 
in the sky... Is that 
thing made of...aer...?

## POINTER 1223
How could that...?

## POINTER 1224
A monster made of aer... 
I feel like I've heard that story 
long ago someplace...

## POINTER 1225
I never could have 
imagined something so big 
it could cover the sky...

## POINTER 1226
You want to see the Don?<PAGE>There's no way 
the Don would meet 
with kids like you.

## POINTER 1227
Even if he did, he'd 
kill you in an instant.

## POINTER 1228
Ain't no Knights here. 
We--the guilds--protect 
this town!

## POINTER 1229
You all gotta be 
ready for the worst!

## POINTER 1230
I was thinking of 
going to the Union jail 
for a little bit.<PAGE>I want to go laugh 
at the Knight they caught.

## POINTER 1231
That Knight dragged people into 
jail, and now he's in jail himself...
Bet he's not laughing now.

## POINTER 1232
They went and let 
that Knight out of jail.

## POINTER 1233
What are they doing, 
slacking at the jail 
at a time like this?

## POINTER 1234
It'd be nice if something 
happened around here.

## POINTER 1235
I can't stand days 
with no excitement.

## POINTER 1236
There's no point in 
signing a treaty! We should 
go crush the Empire.

## POINTER 1237
To hell with the 
Empire. We should go 
wipe them off the map.

## POINTER 1238
What the...?! 
What is that thing?!

## POINTER 1239
Whoa...! 
One screw up 
and we're dead.

## POINTER 1240
...Now things are starting 
to get interesting...<PAGE>This is the way 
the world should be... 
Hah hah hah hah...

## POINTER 1241
Palestralle is furious about 
the Duce getting killed.<PAGE>I wonder what'll 
happen now...

## POINTER 1242
The Don's time is done. 
Whose time is it now?

## POINTER 1243
Now the Union's gonna fall apart.

## POINTER 1244
The Empire's in 
bad shape, too.

## POINTER 1245
Serves them right.

## POINTER 1246
W-we're safe as long as we stay
inside the barrier, right?

## POINTER 1247
Hey, I can laugh 
because it's not me.

## POINTER 1248
What the hell is happening?

## POINTER 1249
This is a dream...
This is all a dream, 
I'm telling you...

## POINTER 1250
Union headquarters 
are up ahead. Did you 
want to see the Don?<PAGE>The guy's scary. Don't 
say I didn't warn you 
if you pee in your pants.

## POINTER 1251
There are some people who 
get so nervous they can't 
speak in front of the Don.

## POINTER 1252
Hunting the monsters is our job. 
It ain't funny if other guilds
try to muscle in on our territory!

## POINTER 1253
We Hunting Blades
will lose face if the 
monsters defeat us!

## POINTER 1254
I don't kill 
people willingly.<PAGE>It's not about morals 
or taking lives. 
It's just my policy.

## POINTER 1255
Whatever. I gotta pay 
the Empire back. I'm 
gonna have some fun.

## POINTER 1256
A guild feud, huh?
That's not so bad 
every now and then.

## POINTER 1257
A guild struggle, huh? 
That has nothing to do 
with us Hunting Blades.

## POINTER 1258
Looks like the 
summons from the 
chief isn't happening yet.

## POINTER 1259
I wonder what kind of monster 
the chief is going to hunt next.

## POINTER 1260
Damn, that damn monster... 
We can't do anything when 
we're here on the ground!

## POINTER 1261
Flying through the sky... 
Stupid monsters... Cowards, 
get down here and fight!<PAGE>Of course they're cowards. 
They're monsters.

## POINTER 1262
I hear the chief 
went a little wild
in Nordopolica.<PAGE>I wonder what 
the target was.

## POINTER 1263
I wonder if Nan and Tison
are doing all right.<PAGE>I haven't caught 
much lately.

## POINTER 1264
Everyone dies. 
But the Don did 
it with style.

## POINTER 1265
I never thought I'd see the 
Don's final moments 
with my own eyes.

## POINTER 1266
I hope the Hunting 
Blades are all right.

## POINTER 1267
Tison and I started together. 
We haven't worked together 
for a while though...

## POINTER 1268
Monsters are evil. 
Big monsters 
are big evils.<PAGE>We should get rid 
of the big evils 
before the little ones.

## POINTER 1269
But that'd be tough, 
even with the strength 
of the Hunting Blades.

## POINTER 1270
...For a monster, that 
thing's just a little 
too big to feel real.<PAGE>Oh well. 
We gotta take it down 
like any other monster...!

## POINTER 1271
But it's too big... 
I'm just not feeling this...

## POINTER 1272
You can't rely on anybody 
from the Empire.

## POINTER 1273
They don't give a damn 
about common people. 
Stuck up, little...

## POINTER 1274
What?! What's going on?! 
Why would the barrier fail?

## POINTER 1275
Whoa, whoa, what the 
hell is this? What 
the hell's going on?

## POINTER 1276
We'll stick with the Don to the 
end! And we'll "don" our finest 
armor to do it! Hah hah hah!!

## POINTER 1277
You guys wanna join us?

## POINTER 1278
So that piece of crap 
Barbos finally showed 
his true colors...

## POINTER 1279
Well, everyone already 
knew about that Barbos.

## POINTER 1280
So, I guess peace once 
again comes to Dahngrest.

## POINTER 1281
The value of peace 
can only be understood 
by those who know war.

## POINTER 1282
I support the treaty 
of friendship.

## POINTER 1283
We're better off without 
war, you know?

## POINTER 1284
Whoa, whoa, trouble again? 
What the hell's going on?

## POINTER 1285
There's just no end to 
problems in this world.

## POINTER 1286
You'd have to be 
crazy to pick a fight 
with Palestralle.<PAGE>It's dangerous
to get on their
bad side...

## POINTER 1287
I don't think just taking 
responsibility is gonna 
stop things anymore...

## POINTER 1288
You can't move forward 
if you're bound by sadness.

## POINTER 1289
We have to keep everything 
the Don taught us in our 
hearts, and press on.

## POINTER 1290
We can't grieve one 
man's death forever.<PAGE>Time goes on, and memories fade. 
That's just the way it is.

## POINTER 1291
All that matters is that we 
keep feeling the presence 
of the Don in this city.

## POINTER 1292
There's a monster in 
the sky... I wonder what 
the Don would do...

## POINTER 1293
If the Don were here... 
No, the Don isn't 
here anymore.<PAGE>We have to decide 
for ourselves.

## POINTER 1294
How embarrassing 
for Harry. I mean, 
he's an adult.<PAGE>He was crying 
just now, right?

## POINTER 1295
I thought that 
cry-baby Harry
had grown up.<PAGE>But ever since Nordopolica, 
I don't feel that at all.

## POINTER 1296
We have to decide 
for ourselves...<PAGE>But when it comes 
down to it, it's so 
much pressure...

## POINTER 1297
...It's times like 
these, I know just how 
great a man the Don was.

## POINTER 1298
......

## POINTER 1299
W-we'll be fine.
The Don will do 
something about this.
