## POINTER 6300
I cannot rest 
even at night.<PAGE>There’s so much to do...
Let's get to work!

## POINTER 6301
There are so many documents 
still to be dealt with...<PAGE>Bring them to me now!

## POINTER 6302
With the Don gone 
I have to do Union
work during the day.<PAGE>And I have to do 
Guild work at night...

## POINTER 6303
What do you want in the middle of the night?! 
Don’t even think 
of attacking me!

## POINTER 6304
It’s not like I’m 
carrying anything valuable...

## POINTER 6305
I’m even working when I’m sleeping! 
*Sigh* Is this anyway 
to live?

## POINTER 6306
Everyone say’s that getting married 
makes a woman happy. 
Well that's not for me! But I wonder if there are any good guys out there...

## POINTER 6307
Ah, busy busy! 
No time to sleep! 
Busy...

## POINTER 6308
Huh? When did I sleep? 
Let's see...<PAGE>...I'll be damned! 
I haven't slept for about six days...

## POINTER 6309
This is Fortune's Market
 headquarters.<PAGE>The President is not here right now. 
What do you want?

## POINTER 6310
This is Fortune's Market
 headquarters.<PAGE>The President is not here right now. 
Get to the point.

## POINTER 6311
Don’t come to the office 
so often in the dead of night.

## POINTER 6312
I'll have the guards 
arrest you!

## POINTER 6313
Woof!

## POINTER 6314
Woof woof.

## POINTER 6315
I can't find my dentures.

## POINTER 6316
I can't go home until 
I find my dentures...

## POINTER 6317
Where did I drop 
my wife's dentures?

## POINTER 6318
I can't find them 
in the dark. <PAGE>I'll just have to share 
my dentures with her...

## POINTER 6319
*Cough cough cough...* 
*Cough hack cough* 
*Hack hack cough...*

## POINTER 6320
The Knights decided 
to ignore the lower 
quarter as usual. <PAGE>I mean, they didn't do 
squat about the aque 
blastia either, right?

## POINTER 6321
<STR>(FRE) hasn't come 
back to Zaphias... 
We're in trouble.

## POINTER 6322
The citizens of Zaphias
escaped with <STR>(FRE). <PAGE>Maybe I should have 
followed them...

## POINTER 6323
It's already over for Zaphias.

## POINTER 6324
Whew... It's taking 
a while to get things 
cleaned up. <PAGE>We need at least a 
few more people...

## POINTER 6325
Maybe I should ask 
<STR>(FRE) if he can 
lend us some people.

## POINTER 6326
I've lived a long time, 
but I never thought I'd 
see a monster like that... <PAGE>I thought my dentures 
were gonna fall out.

## POINTER 6327
I was so surprised, 
my dentures popped 
right out of my mouth. <PAGE>Better be careful.

## POINTER 6328
My dentures actually 
fell out of my mouth. <PAGE>That jolt from the north 
spooked me so bad, 
and pop! Out they came.

## POINTER 6329
Can I get your 
help to find them?

## POINTER 6330
Welcome! The sun may have set, 
but the store's still open. So 
don't worry if you forget something.

## POINTER 6331
Thanks! 
Please come again. I'll 
be waiting for you here.

## POINTER 6332
Do some shopping and 
forget all your worries!

## POINTER 6333
Thank you! 
Come again, even if it's 
just to make fun of me!

## POINTER 6334
You've been working late! 
I'll be working late too...

## POINTER 6335
Thank you! 
Make sure you brush your 
teeth before going to bed!

## POINTER 6336
I won't be leaving any time soon. 
That's the heart of a merchant. 
Go ahead and make your selections.

## POINTER 6337
Thank you! 
Make sure you take a 
bath before going to bed.

## POINTER 6338
The number of products don't match. 
Maybe they're rolling around somewhere? 
Could you keep an eye out?

## POINTER 6339
Thank you! 
Don't work so hard 
you oversleep!

## POINTER 6340
The Knights have continued 
working into the night. 
I can't slack off. Welcome!

## POINTER 6341
Thank you! 
See you tomorrow!

## POINTER 6342
Recently, small incidents 
don't really rattle me. 
Watch how I am tonight!

## POINTER 6343
Thank you! 
Dream good dreams!

## POINTER 6344
I don't think the water is 
going to stop at all. I've been 
working like this all day... <PAGE>I'm starting to get tired. 
Hey, trade places with me...

## POINTER 6345
I'm totally wet 
from working all day... <PAGE>Water, women... 
Yeah, I know what 
you're thinking.

## POINTER 6346
One day this water will 
run out and we won't 
know what to do... <PAGE>But we'll survive if 
we work together.

## POINTER 6347
You shouldn't be out 
and about with a 
woman at this hour. <PAGE>Do you want me 
to tell <STR>(FRE)?

## POINTER 6348
Are you all out 
on night patrol? <PAGE>Be careful the Knights 
don't catch you as they 
make their rounds.

## POINTER 6349
It is time for good 
children to be sleeping. <PAGE>Who is this bad 
adult that has 
taken you out?

## POINTER 6350
I remember swimming in 
this fountain after coming 
back on a hot day the other time. <PAGE>That was quite nice.

## POINTER 6351
I won't be swimming today 
because it’s not that hot.

## POINTER 6352
I'm so worried 
I can't sleep. <PAGE>The monsters may come 
and attack if the 
barrier is unstable.

## POINTER 6353
There are other people that 
stayed behind too. I'm sure we'll 
endure if we all stick together. <PAGE>My girlfriend is still in the 
capital. I cannot be weak.

## POINTER 6354
When I think about a lower quarter
where everyone can live safely, 
I just have to do something.

## POINTER 6355
I want to get it back 
to what it was, before 
you or <STR>(FRE) return.

## POINTER 6356
I'm cooperating with 
the monster warnings. <PAGE>It must be very hard on the Knights. 
I was hoping my contribution would 
alleviate some of that burden.

## POINTER 6357
It's be awful if the Knights 
were infested with people who 
would do evil at any chance. <PAGE>Anyway, I can probably only 
take over guard duties.

## POINTER 6358
I heard <STR>(FRE) built a new 
town, but I'm sure he'll come back 
to the lower quarter sometime. <PAGE>To be more accurate, 
he'll return to the castle
because he's a Knight.

## POINTER 6359
<STR>(FRE) can't leave the lower quarter
to fend for itself, either. 
He's just like <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 6360
It seems that 
the aque blastia went 
completely bust.

## POINTER 6361
For now, I collected some of 
the water that overflowed. <PAGE>I'm sure we can survive on that 
for a while... But first off, 
we need to stop the fountain.

## POINTER 6362
I hear that Mordio escaped? <PAGE>I remember how big he was, but I 
didn't get a look at his face 
because he was wearing a hood.

## POINTER 6363
<STR>(YUR), I can't believe the 
Imperial Knights arrested you 
instead of chasing Mordio. <PAGE>Well, I guess with the stuff 
you pull everyday, they do 
have their reasons...

## POINTER 6364
Don't wander outside 
a lot at night. You're 
a wanted person.

## POINTER 6365
I won't be able to sleep for 
another 3 hours because I 
just ate a piece of cake. <PAGE>Why can't I ever 
conquer temptation?

## POINTER 6366
Are you going 
to the city? <PAGE>If you're going up, 
there something that I 
need to you to purchase.

## POINTER 6367
You know that I have to 
climb that steep hill to 
go up? It's really steep.

## POINTER 6368
What happened to <STR>(FRE)? 
He always comes running 
in emergencies.

## POINTER 6369
The only Knight I 
trust is <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 6370
I'm praying to the skies.

## POINTER 6371
I'm sure that my dead 
husband is keeping an 
eye on me from above.

## POINTER 6372
We should ask the government 
to fix public blastia. <PAGE>Of course, I doubt they'd 
ever get around to fixing a 
blastia in the lower quarter.

## POINTER 6373
You all wouldn't believe 
what the Empire does 
with its finances. <PAGE>Do you have any idea how little 
of our hard-earned taxes actually 
make it back to the lower quarter?

## POINTER 6374
You know that the throne is 
vacant, right? But the country 
continues to operate. <PAGE>So the emperor is 
just symbolic.

## POINTER 6375
The Empire is actually 
run by the Imperial 
Council and Knights. <PAGE>The Council and the Knights 
have about equal strength.

## POINTER 6376
A monopoly on blastia gives you power. <PAGE>For example, the barrier blastia. 
This city would be annihilated in an 
instant if they took that away.

## POINTER 6377
The emperor can use 
the blastia for absolute 
control over the citizens. <PAGE>Isn't it dangerous to 
give the emperor such 
powerful authority?

## POINTER 6378
With the chaos in the Empire, it's 
a good time to question whether the 
imperial family are worthy administrators. <PAGE>Any one not thinking hard about the 
political situation now has no 
right to be a citizen of the Empire.

## POINTER 6379
What I'm trying to do is figure 
out if you're really qualified 
to be a citizen of the Empire<PAGE>...You're not really listening, 
are you? You're bored. It's 
written all over your face...

## POINTER 6380
Halt! 
If you go any further, 
you'll leave the city. <PAGE>There are always more vicious 
monsters on the prowl at night. It's 
dangerous for you equipped like that.

## POINTER 6381
You cannot be allowed 
to leave the city with such 
light equipment. <PAGE>Come back with the 
proper armaments 
during the day.

## POINTER 6382
An emergency order has been 
issued to seal off the capital. 
I cannot permit you to pass.

## POINTER 6383
The gate is sealed. 
No one may pass until 
the order is lifted.<PAGE>It seems a little shady that 
you want to leave at night. 
You, you're not thinking...

## POINTER 6384
It's manual. <PAGE>Welcome to the Imperial 
Capital of Zaphias.

## POINTER 6385
I'm worried about that strange 
aurora surrounding the castle, 
but I can't leave my post. <PAGE>What happened to the other knights? 
Are they defending the castle? 
Nobody's telling me anything!

## POINTER 6386
Regardless of the 
situation, my duty is 
to guard this place. <PAGE>I'll carry out my duty 
until the end while wearing 
the blue sword insignia.

## POINTER 6387
Welcome to the Imperial 
Capital of Zaphiaaah......
... I'm sleepy

## POINTER 6388
I can't lose my 
concentration especially, 
when guarding at night.

## POINTER 6389
When something like 
that happens, I am so 
thankful for the barrier. <PAGE>I have now realized its value 
for a good night sleep.

## POINTER 6390
The Knights promise tranquil 
nights in the capital that 
never change, no matter what.

## POINTER 6391
Sleep soundly.

## POINTER 6392
Welcome to Art Paradise! <PAGE>Your eternal smile copied 
onto the canvas invites me 
to an Eden of ecstasy.

## POINTER 6393
Fate has brought before 
me, with the heavenly brush, 
this amazing subject. <PAGE>Will you be my model? 
Let's create Eden together.

## POINTER 6394
............<PAGE>Do you think it's strange? 
There are nights that I 
get sentimental too.

## POINTER 6395
The monsters dwell at night. 
Darkness covers sky, and eats 
away at the hearts of the people. <PAGE>I draw the people's momentary 
sadness. I am the stained glass 
of the people's heart.

## POINTER 6396
What? 
My wanted posted doesn't 
look like you? <PAGE>Whether the resemblance is 
there or not is nonsense! 
That drawing is a work of art.

## POINTER 6397
Ahh, a drawing from the back? 
This is my lukewarm kindness to 
people who do not understand art. <PAGE>Sometimes even scribbling is 
necessary to earn money for food.

## POINTER 6398
I'm waiting for 
the dragon to come. <PAGE>I watch and wait every night... 
Oh, my magificent dragon...

## POINTER 6399
I've been awake all night... I'm so...<PAGE>No! How could I do this if I 
were asleep? I will keep going 
until I draw the dragon...
