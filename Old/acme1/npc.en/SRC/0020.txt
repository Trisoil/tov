## POINTER 2000
You're a Knight, right? 
...Huh? You're not?

## POINTER 2001
The Knights are gonna 
protect this town! 
We're gonna be safe!<PAGE>Maybe I should join 
the Knights, too.

## POINTER 2002
Hey mister, 
aren't you going to 
join the Knights?

## POINTER 2003
Waaaah! I'm scared! 
There's a big ol' 
monster in the sky!

## POINTER 2004
It's gonna fall! 
It's gonna fall on us! 
We're gonna get squashed!

## POINTER 2005
W-we're still getting ready... 
So please come back again later.

## POINTER 2006
W-we're not open yet... 
Huh?! Suspicious? I'm not 
being suspicious at all!

## POINTER 2007
W-Welcome. 
Party of six...and, uh, one dog? 
That'll be 400 Gald.

## POINTER 2008
Come back any time 
you need a rest.

## POINTER 2009
You made it through the desert?! 
Rest easy now. You've earned it. 
But that'll still be 400 Gald.

## POINTER 2010
Take your time and enjoy 
what night should really 
be like here in Mantaic.

## POINTER 2011
Usually there's a 12 
o'clock curfew, but today 
we can stay out all night!

## POINTER 2012
Take your time and enjoy what 
night should really be like here in 
Mantaic. It's 400 Gald for a room.

## POINTER 2013
Welcome, welcome! 
You must be tired. 
A room is 400 Gald.

## POINTER 2014
Welcome! I've heard a lot of 
unsettling rumors lately. 
A room is 400 Gald.

## POINTER 2015
Welcome! 
We've got a delicious dinner and 
nice, fluffy beds for 400 Gald.

## POINTER 2016
Get out of here... 
You're annoying...

## POINTER 2017
............
......
......Shut up.

## POINTER 2018
Hey! It's you! Did my 
canteen help in coming back 
from the desert alive?<PAGE>Go ahead. Keep it. Use it as 
long as you like. It's my way of 
celebrating our new freedom!

## POINTER 2019
The <STR>(FRE) Brigade's great 
and all, but you people are pretty 
incredible, too. I can tell!

## POINTER 2020
A whole bunch of 
Knights showed up 
again a while ago.<PAGE>I was so worried they 
were here to take over 
the town again.

## POINTER 2021
Luckily, that didn't 
happen at all.<PAGE>What was that all about, anyway?

## POINTER 2022
Welcome...or so I'd like to be 
able to say. The Trino Liner Service 
isn't operating right now.<PAGE>The magistrate says he'll 
sink any ship that sets out. 
Can you believe that?

## POINTER 2023
The Trino Liner Service is a sailing 
Guild. Neither wind nor rain can 
stop our ship, the Stratos...<PAGE>...But it isn't too much 
of a match for storms.

## POINTER 2024
Welcome... How I wish I could 
say that. The Liner Service 
is out of operation.

## POINTER 2025
The Stratos, flagship of the Trino 
Liner Service sailing Guild, is 
currently being overhauled!<PAGE>You'll have to wait a bit longer before 
service resumes, I'm afraid.

## POINTER 2026
Welcome... But then that would be 
a lie, wouldn't it? The Liner 
Service is suspended right now.

## POINTER 2027
They say Don Whitehorse 
passed on.<PAGE>We can't confirm what the 
situation's like in Capua Torim, 
so we can't set sail.

## POINTER 2028
Welcome... Sorry, I'm just kidding. 
*Sigh*... Liner Service 
is suspended right now.

## POINTER 2029
Our sailing Guild, Trino Liner Service, is currently 
lending out the Stratos to the Knights. 
They need it to get evacuees to safety.<PAGE>I'm afraid we aren't running regular 
service right now. Please understand.

## POINTER 2030
Welcome... Oh, how I want to be 
able to say that. Liner Service 
isn't in operation right now.

## POINTER 2031
Some strange structure 
sprang out of the sea!<PAGE>People say it even sucks ships 
in. It's way too dangerous, so 
the Liner Service is suspended.

## POINTER 2032
Welcome... Oh, why do I even 
keep saying it. Liner Services 
are completely suspended.

## POINTER 2033
The Trino Liner Services 
hasn't set sail 
in months.<PAGE>The Guild is strapped for cash, all thanks to 
our ship being strapped down...oh, I don't 
even know what I'm talking about anymore.

## POINTER 2034
What is that tower? <PAGE>I hope it doesn't interfere 
with the operation 
of the ship...

## POINTER 2035
That has nothing to do with the sea 
because that happened on the mountain! 
But that's something I can't say.

## POINTER 2036
Welcome! Welcome 
to Trino Freight!<PAGE>The Liner Service? It wasn't 
bringing in any money, so we 
changed our business model.

## POINTER 2037
It's been a string of 
cataclysmic catastrophes 
lately, on sky, land and sea!<PAGE>With things being as they 
are, freight service is 
bringing in big money.

## POINTER 2038
Welcome, have a look 
at our wares!

## POINTER 2039
Taxes are high and the 
shop is not profitable.<PAGE>Could you please 
buy more...

## POINTER 2040
Welcome! Even if the 
Magistrates change, our 
service doesn't!

## POINTER 2041
Come back any time.

## POINTER 2042
Welcome! Anything you need, 
fast and reasonably-priced!

## POINTER 2043
Welcome! Feel free to pick up and look 
at anything you're interested in.

## POINTER 2044
I really have a bad feeling 
about this... The bureaucrats 
keep talking about money... <PAGE>Can't we just go ahead 
and play a game?

## POINTER 2045
<mini>ISIIt's a duel!

## POINTER 2046
There's a certain romance to be 
found in stones. I shall become 
the King of Stone-Taking!

## POINTER 2047
I can feel the heartbeats of 
the stones...is this love?

## POINTER 2048
Come again.

## POINTER 2049
Can you sense it? The very 
will of the stones...<PAGE>...Yes, the stony will 
of the stones...
...Sorry. A little joke.

## POINTER 2050
The stones are omniscient. They 
know the height of the sky...the 
depth of the seas.<PAGE>But do they know where my wife's 
secret nest-egg is hidden...? 
That's the real question...

## POINTER 2051
Anything is possible as long 
as you have the stones... 
I used to believe that.

## POINTER 2052
You want to test the stones? 
Very well... Wait. That young 
lady's not with you.<PAGE>I just can't get 
into it if that lady's 
not here...

## POINTER 2053
I only challenge those in 
whom I take interest.<PAGE>I can't use the stones 
constantly. That would 
be rude to them!

## POINTER 2054
I have 10,000 stones in 
my collection. Quite 
impressive, I'd say.

## POINTER 2055
If you're tired, why not sit 
down to play Stone-Taking with 
me? It's quite refreshing.

## POINTER 2056
Stones are the perfect refreshment. 
Rolling them over and over... This 
is the true path to enlightenment.

## POINTER 2057
Any troubles this world may face would pass 
by so easily, if only people would discuss 
them in tranquility with the stones.

## POINTER 2058
One must put unfortunate goings-on 
out of one's mind, come to perfect 
calm, and merge with the stones...<PAGE>Nnngh...! I cannot 
see anything...

## POINTER 2059
Mmmgh...! See there, the 
stones are shaking, 
crying out in dismay!<PAGE>What...? It's just 
an earthquake...?

## POINTER 2060
Stone-Taking is not an escape from reality! 
Nay. It is a technique by which one may 
witness the very beginning of the world.

## POINTER 2061
The stones are as crystals which 
preserve all the world's memory. 
Just look at them...<PAGE>...This one reminds 
me of my wife's face.

## POINTER 2062
We're not in business right now 
because the magistrate gets a 
percentage by way of taxes.<PAGE>I'm really sorry.

## POINTER 2063
This is such a good spot, 
so I'm staying here...<PAGE>I'll set up shop 
here one day...

## POINTER 2064
With Ragou gone, there's going 
to be a new magistrate coming.<PAGE>I just hope the taxes he 
sets are reasonable...

## POINTER 2065
Just a few more months... One day 
I'll have a wonderful spread of 
products for sale. I'm sure of it...

## POINTER 2066
The new magistrate 
arrived, but taxes haven't 
gotten any cheaper...<PAGE>I suppose any tariffs the 
Empire's petty bureaucrats 
set aren't easily lowered.

## POINTER 2067
When am I going to be able 
to get back in business...?

## POINTER 2068
Things are in chaos over in the 
Empire...things are in chaos in 
Tolbyccia because the Don died.<PAGE>I can't even imagine when I'm going 
to be able to open shop back up...

## POINTER 2069
How am I going 
to make a living 
now...?

## POINTER 2070
*Sigh*...paying the rental fee 
for this spot day in and day out 
is eating away my savings...<PAGE>Why do I stay here? I can't 
let a location as good as 
this slip out of my hands.

## POINTER 2071
My priorities may be skewed, but 
there's no way I could convince 
myself to give this space up.

## POINTER 2072
I swear, my luck is even 
worse now than it was when 
Ragou was in charge.<PAGE>Do you think it's because I'm 
so obsessed with this spot?

## POINTER 2073
Maybe I should give this location up, 
and open up shop in some other town. 
Maybe that would bring me luck...

## POINTER 2074
My heart is still racing... <PAGE>I've never seen something 
so unbelievable.

## POINTER 2075
I'm still in shock... <PAGE>I'm really a coward.

## POINTER 2076
I've made up my mind! 
I'm making a suicide 
pact with this spot!<PAGE>I don't care what anyone 
thinks about me. This is 
where I'm doing business.

## POINTER 2077
If I survive, and if I'm ever able 
to freely stock merchandise, 
come back and buy something.<PAGE>I'll be waiting for you.

## POINTER 2078
There was someone dressed 
all in black wandering around. 
He was really suspicious. <PAGE>And to think, he's the executioner 
hired by the magistrate... I really 
don't like the era that we live in...

## POINTER 2079
A wise man never courts 
danger! I'd like to start 
my business here. <PAGE>But in this world, you can be 
murdered without doing anything 
wrong... It's unbelievable...

## POINTER 2080
I heard a metallic sound behind
the alley. I couldn't see anything
because it was dark.<PAGE>I thought someone was being
murdered... I guess something
like that is not rare in this city.

## POINTER 2081
You.... you... came out
from the alley?<PAGE>I never thought you would
be stealing because you
couldn't pay taxes.

## POINTER 2082
I'm always out of stock when 
supplies don't arrive due to 
harsh ocean conditions. <PAGE>I've never experienced 
anything like this. Why are 
the ocean conditions like this?

## POINTER 2083
Unless there is inventory 
to sell, there's nothing 
to eat tomorrow... <PAGE>It's been like this 
ever since the 
magistrate arrived.

## POINTER 2084
Woo. It finally 
cleared. <PAGE>At least, clear skies 
bring a little 
piece of mind.

## POINTER 2085
Only if the magistrate would 
come clean as a good person 
under these blue skies... <PAGE>Like that'll ever happen...

## POINTER 2086
Shipping routes for cargo 
are still so unstable...<PAGE>Aaaah! It's all because Fortune's 
Market monopolizes them!

## POINTER 2087
Maybe I should just find out if Fortune's 
Market will let me join them...

## POINTER 2088
Apparently Fortune's Market 
has their own, exclusive 
shipping routes for cargo...<PAGE>One of them passes across the ice 
floes to the north. That's impossible 
for normal folk to compete with!

## POINTER 2089
I hear they have to bring their 
cargo over extremely thin ice. 
They're risking their lives!

## POINTER 2090
The port's full of warships and 
there's some kind of strange 
building out on the sea.<PAGE>Where in the world is 
Fortune's Market getting 
their merchandise from?

## POINTER 2091
Even at a time like this, the 
shop across the way is doing 
gangbuster business.<PAGE>I...I think I want to join 
Fortune's Market...

## POINTER 2092
The world's gone all to hell lately, 
so I finally made up my mind 
to join Fortune's Market...<PAGE>...But when I applied, they wanted 
me to pay a huge contract deposit! 
I can't afford that!

## POINTER 2093
I suppose locals really do 
have to join hands and work 
together, after all...

## POINTER 2094
What's the deal, here 
and there... I'm tired 
of this...! <PAGE>I'm sorry, I just got 
a little distracted...

## POINTER 2095
I wonder if it's over for this 
world... Is it okay that I'm 
doing something like this?

## POINTER 2096
Earthquakes, the northern mountains 
crumbling...to be perfectly honest, I 
just want to run away...<PAGE>...But I can't abandon the place 
I was born, much less go beyond 
the barrier...can I?

## POINTER 2097
The people at the shop next door 
seem to be doing their best. 
I suppose I should, too.

## POINTER 2098
Are you travelers? Watch 
out. The magistrates in 
this city are evil. <PAGE>Not only do they take taxes 
from their citizens, they 
also make travelers pay.

## POINTER 2099
Our magistrates are evil. They 
don't have second thoughts 
when murdering people. <PAGE>You shouldn't stick around if you 
think it's going to be dangerous.
