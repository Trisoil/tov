## POINTER 5100
That's a sneak peek of the climactic finish. 
Tune in next time for the final chapter!

## POINTER 5101
.... Don't interfere 
with my work. <PAGE>Don't speak 
to me!

## POINTER 5102
The ominous shadow has now taken its 
leave, but we must remain vigilant.<PAGE>Though it may someday come again, to 
threaten our world, never again shall 
he fear its darkness. The end.

## POINTER 5103
Hmm, this started out as a nonfiction 
work, but somewhere along the way 
it turned into a fantasy novel...

## POINTER 5104
I have yet to shake the fear that grips 
my heart, and it keeps me from sleeping.<PAGE>What happened in Zaphias 
was just terrible.

## POINTER 5105
I'll be all right, but 
I am deeply worried about 
my child's future.

## POINTER 5106
Everything was wonderful when we 
lived in the capital. I could help 
make my son's dreams a reality.<PAGE>But how can he think 
of writing a novel at 
a time such as this?

## POINTER 5107
It goes to show how fragile we humans really are. 
In the blink of an eye, our destiny, even the 
way we see the world can change for good.

## POINTER 5108
The passion to work on a novel, 
writing feverishly through the 
night without sleeping...<PAGE>If only he could put such 
energy to better use...

## POINTER 5109
Ahh, I wish he'd turned out 
a bit more like that young 
captain, Sir <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 5110
Step right up! Have a look! I've got 
some stuff here you won't wanna miss!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!

## POINTER 5111
Step right up! Have a look! I've got 
only the freshest wares in stock!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!

## POINTER 5112
Step right up! Have a 
look! Piping hot and right 
out of the oven!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!

## POINTER 5113
Step right up! Have a look! 
Everything you see was 
caught fresh today!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!

## POINTER 5114
Step right up! Have 
a look! Fresh off 
the griddle!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!

## POINTER 5115
Step right up! Have a look! 
Only the most succulent 
morsels available here!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!

## POINTER 5116
Step right up! Have a look! 
Everything here came straight 
from the sea!<PAGE>Always a pleasure!

## POINTER 5117
Hello and welcome. We're 
here to meet your needs, 
even at night.

## POINTER 5118
We appreciate your business.

## POINTER 5119
This warehouse functions as a storage facility 
for Fortune's Market's merchandise.<PAGE>What's up? Are you here to help 
organize the inventory?

## POINTER 5120
This is the Fortune's 
Market stock warehouse. <PAGE>You'd better not be thinking 
of stealing from here!

## POINTER 5121
This is Fortune's Market's 
merchandise warehouse.<PAGE>The President took some items out recently, 
so I'm looking for someone to help 
reorganize. What do you say?

## POINTER 5122
The President just took out a 
big shipment of items she said 
were headed for Nordopolica.<PAGE>I've got to get this place cleaned up, but I don't want 
to do it alone. Think you might want to lend a hand?

## POINTER 5123
This warehouse functions as a storage facility 
for Fortune's Market's merchandise.<PAGE>Thanks to the trouble in Dahngrest, 
we're short on people. Think you 
might want to lend a hand?

## POINTER 5124
This is the Fortune's 
Market stock warehouse. <PAGE>Get out of here 
unless you want me 
tocall the Knights!

## POINTER 5125
This warehouse functions as a storage 
facility for Fortune's Market.<PAGE>I'm having a hard time getting enough 
help around here. You know how 
it is. Why not lend a hand?

## POINTER 5126
I put up a help wanted 
flyer a while back...<PAGE>It didn't seem to do much good though. 
Things are still pretty chaotic in here... 
Think you might want to lend a hand?

## POINTER 5127
This warehouse functions as a storage 
facility for Fortune's Market.<PAGE>We were finally able to get our next shipment 
of goods, but the warehouse is still a bit of 
a mess. Think you could help clean things up?

## POINTER 5128
This is the Fortune's 
Market stock warehouse. <PAGE>I guard this warehouse like 
a wall of iron! Not one 
thief will get passed me!

## POINTER 5129
This warehouse functions as a storage 
facility for Fortune's Market.<PAGE>Word's come down that we're shipping goods to some town 
that's picked up a bunch of refugees from the capital. 
Think you might help us get things in order?

## POINTER 5130
From what I hear, Fortune's Market 
is leading the push to send goods 
to the southern continent.<PAGE>It's my job to make sure the inventory 
here's all present and accounted 
for. How's a bout lending a hand?

## POINTER 5131
We can't run our 
Liner at night... <PAGE>Sorry!

## POINTER 5132
Welcome to the the world class 
Trino Ferry, man. Let us know 
if you need a ride, okay?

## POINTER 5133
Man, our ferry, the Stratos is in the shop 
right now gettin' a tune up, ya know?<PAGE>Hate to tell you this, man, but we're 
not launching any boats right now.

## POINTER 5134
Hey man, I don't know what the 
deal is, but the Stratos hasn't 
come back from Nor Harbor.<PAGE>So, like, the ferry service is 
taking a little break, you dig?

## POINTER 5135
The Trino Ferry guild is fully 
into the justice scene, man.<PAGE>We're gonna load the Stratos up 
with refugees, man, and just run 
that baby as fast as she'll go.

## POINTER 5136
Here at the Trino Ferry, we've got 
a bulletproof driving record, man.<PAGE>We figure the sea's pretty choppy 
right now though, so we're puttin' 
the ferry service on hold, man.

## POINTER 5137
Things are sorta touch and go out there 
in the wide world right now, so we've gotta 
hold off on the ferry service, man.<PAGE>Wonder how long it'll be 'til 
we can launch the boats again.

## POINTER 5138
So, we're finally trying our hands 
at something new. Our guild's gotten 
into the shipping business, man.<PAGE>To be honest though, I 
liked the boats that carried 
people better...

## POINTER 5139
Anyway, man, welcome to the world class 
Trino Transport. Let us know if there's 
anything you need shipped, okay?

## POINTER 5140
I've heard tell of a funny-lookin' boat that's 
been out sailin' the seas, lately. It's all 
beat up, and looks like it's got no crew...<PAGE>If you're headin' out on the deep blue, 
I'd keep my eyes peeled if I was you.

## POINTER 5141
There's still a great many mysteries 
out on the briny deep, ya know.

## POINTER 5142
That beat up old ship'll give ya a scare, and 
then you've got the mer-men ta worry about.<PAGE>They'll come at ya in great numbers, 
and pull anybody they can 
down to a watery grave.

## POINTER 5143
If you're plannin' ta ride the rollin' waves, 
I'd warn ya ta keep a good lookout for funny-lookin' 
boats and the mer-men, both.

## POINTER 5144
The sea be full'o 
terrifying creatures...
But this is the attraction o' the mighty sea.

## POINTER 5145
Now that the Don's passed on I'll 
bet Dahngrest is in a real pickle.<PAGE>At least we've got Fortune's 
Market here, so we should be 
able ta weather the storm.

## POINTER 5146
Not ta worry, I tell ya. 
We've got President Kaufman 
here, after all.<PAGE>Might not be a bad idea for you to put 
down roots in this town yourselves.

## POINTER 5147
I've seen it for myself, now. 'Course 
I'm talkin' about the freaky action 
goin' on in the sky over the capital.<PAGE>I mean, wow. Thank the stars they built that 
city on the other side of the ocean, huh?

## POINTER 5148
Those people in the capital have gotta be havin' a nasty time 
of it. Not that there's a whole lot we can do from here.

## POINTER 5149
I've heard somethin' came bubblin' 
up outta the middle of the ocean.<PAGE>Hey, what about that old beat up ship?! 
I'll betcha anything it's got 
somethin' ta do with that boat.

## POINTER 5150
The Knights'll probably do somethin' 
or other about it, though.

## POINTER 5151
This town's fixin' ta bust at the seams, but 
it's nothin' ta get too worked up over.<PAGE>My guess is the Knights'll step in 
before things get too outta hand.

## POINTER 5152
Heh, we'll be all right 
unless that thing decides 
ta belly flop on us.

## POINTER 5153
Heyo, you got any idea what the 
deal is with that big ol' building 
is over toward Ilyccia?<PAGE>Sounds like that thing's so tall, the top of 
it's hidin' up there in the clouds somewhere.

## POINTER 5154
Man, just what the heck is that thing? Ya think 
it's some sorta observation tower, maybe?

## POINTER 5155
Our guild's hideout is 
way off on the western 
side of this continent.<PAGE>It's a little place called Dahngrest! 
You should check it out sometime.

## POINTER 5156
Come to think of it, the mercenaries had 
a town somewhere up in the northwest. 
Wait, they might've abandoned that one.

## POINTER 5157
The city of Nordopolica on the 
continent of Desier is ruled by 
a guild known as Palestralle.<PAGE>They're mainly in charge of 
running the coliseum there.

## POINTER 5158
They're pretty much the only 
guild that runs a town.<PAGE>Some say that Heaven's Arrow runs 
things in Dahngrest, but technically 
speaking it's the guild Union.

## POINTER 5159
Fortune's Market has got the 
Union to thank for their cozy 
relationship with the empire.<PAGE>There's no telling if the guilds could even 
keep going if the Don were ever to die, 'cause 
the balance of power would just crumble...

## POINTER 5160
The empire would bring the hammer down 
on the guilds in no time at all.<PAGE>And if that happened, they'd 
strengthen their hold even 
on towns like this.

## POINTER 5161
The death of the Don and Belius... I always thought 
if the two pillars of the guild community 
fell, the empire would crush us in no time.<PAGE>I never thought it'd cause this 
rebellion among the Knights...

## POINTER 5162
This should buy the guilds some time to 
recover from the loss, and get ready to 
push back against the empire if need be.

## POINTER 5163
Knights fighting other Knights, huh...? 
Sounds like the empire's got pretty 
big problems of its own.<PAGE>And the Union can't seem to agree 
on anything, now that they've got 
nobody to bind them together.

## POINTER 5164
With the Don out of the picture, 
maybe this is a time for major 
changes in the guilds.

## POINTER 5165
Perhaps you were unaware, but this 
is a tropical species of plant particular 
to the Tolbyccian continent.<PAGE>It is quite common for heavy 
rains to fall here, you see.

## POINTER 5166
If you proceed further to the west, 
you will surely guess this continent's 
defining character.

## POINTER 5167
This continent sees quite a lot of 
rainfall, but conversely, the continent 
of Desier sees almost none.

## POINTER 5168
With Desier as hot as it is, 
its lack of rain makes the 
climate doubly harsh.

## POINTER 5169
Have you ever been to the 
deserts of Desier? Oh, you 
have? How remarkable.

## POINTER 5170
Is it true that the 
cactuses there are 
a source of water?

## POINTER 5171
The skies above Ilyccia seem 
particularly strange.

## POINTER 5172
The weather has been rather 
unpredictable lately.

## POINTER 5173
W-whatever can that be in the sky? 
It's nothing I'm familiar with.

## POINTER 5174
This is no time to be thinking about how 
much it might rain in a given place.

## POINTER 5175
What's to be done 
with the world now? <PAGE>There isn't a single person left among the elite of the Guilds or the 
Knights who can tackle that question.

## POINTER 5176
All us bottom-
feeders can do 
is worry...

## POINTER 5177
This is Fortune Market's 
home office.

## POINTER 5178
It would be best not 
to visit after dark.

## POINTER 5179
This is the head office 
of Fortune's Market. <PAGE>President Kaufman is 
not in at the moment.

## POINTER 5180
I mentioned to the President 
that I thought her first 
name, Mary, was cute.<PAGE>She cut my pay in half.

## POINTER 5181
The President seems to be quite busy with her work.

## POINTER 5182
I wonder if the President will be staying 
at the office tonight as well.

## POINTER 5183
The President keeps at her work 
regardless of the hour.

## POINTER 5184
Sometimes, I wonder when the President finds any time to sleep.

## POINTER 5185
All sorts of guilds claim this town 
as their base of operations.<PAGE>Out of all of them though, the 
Blood Alliance is said to be 
the most powerful. But um...

## POINTER 5186
Hmm, I don't see any 
of the Alliance's mercenaries 
around...

## POINTER 5187
Barbos, the head of the Blood Alliance 
is a man that clawed his way to 
the top through sheer skill. <PAGE>The rumors say he 
was murdered. Could 
that be true?

## POINTER 5188
Barbos was domineering, arrogant, 
and selfish, but he was 
certainly an able man. <PAGE>I'd like to know who 
could take down that 
kind of a man.

## POINTER 5189
In the past, the mercenaries 
would always go out to do 
their work when night fell.

## POINTER 5190
I wonder how much this town's been changed 
by the absence of the Blood Alliance.

## POINTER 5191
Sounds like something pretty big happened in 
the capital, but it doesn't look like it's got 
anything to do with us here in Torim Harbor.

## POINTER 5192
I'm curious to see how the Union's going 
to manage now that they've lost the Don.

## POINTER 5193
I hear the empire's having to deal with 
some sort of internal problems.

## POINTER 5194
Which reminds me, I also heard someone 
say that a young knight's been cooperating 
with one or another of the guilds.

## POINTER 5195
Just look at that hideous 
beast in the sky. If only 
we still had the Don... <PAGE>Alone we cannot defeat 
that terrible monster 
in the sky...

## POINTER 5196
And now the 
Don is gone, too... <PAGE>Oh, such a cruel and 
heartless world...

## POINTER 5197
Even on a night such as this, 
I can see the monster in the sky. <PAGE>It sure is spooky.

## POINTER 5198
Suppose there's no way one or two 
people could go up against that 
sky monster alone and win.

## POINTER 5199
I'm not sleepy. Not sleepy 
at all. I'm an adult now.
