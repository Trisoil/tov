## POINTER 2200
Doesn't that cloud look just 
like cream on a shortcake...?<PAGE>G-goodness me! What 
am I talking about!

## POINTER 2201
If I want to slim down I'm really going 
to have to hang in there...and enjoy my 
wonderful summer vacation by the sea.

## POINTER 2202
Zaphias seems to be 
troublesome, but it's 
peaceful here. <PAGE>I'd like to monopolize 
a nice place like this.

## POINTER 2203
I'm okay with being told 
that I've escaped from reality, 
because this is my reality...

## POINTER 2204
There seem to be new people 
in town making a fuss, but 
it means little to me.<PAGE>This sea belongs to me. I won't 
let anyone else have it.

## POINTER 2205
...I'm not very fond of people 
who won't shut up, you know...

## POINTER 2206
This spot, in this 
town, is my own personal 
VIP seat.<PAGE>As long as I have this view, 
I don't care what happens.

## POINTER 2207
The sky? I'm afraid unpleasant 
things don't fall into 
my range of vision.

## POINTER 2208
How long will I be able 
to sit here, drinking in 
this spectacular view?<PAGE>Ahh...I wish this would 
last for a thousand, 
ten thousand years...all 
eternity...

## POINTER 2209
Ahh...such beauty...this 
view...I feel like 
I'm in a dream...

## POINTER 2210
...<PAGE>If you don't have any business with 
the magistrate, begone with you.

## POINTER 2211
You don't want to get hurt, 
do you? Get out of here.

## POINTER 2212
This is Magistrate Ragou's manor. Nobody 
can enter without permission.

## POINTER 2213
I receive word about anyone 
permitted entry. I haven't 
heard anything about you. <PAGE>If I say you can't enter, 
you can't enter.

## POINTER 2214
Alright, the sky is clearing. 
I can take my boat out. <PAGE>I hope I don't interrupt 
the magistrate...

## POINTER 2215
I can take my boat out when 
the magistrate is gone...! <PAGE>I'm sure that I'll 
be killed if I send 
a message...!

## POINTER 2216
Finally, the port's been reopened! 
Now we can set sail. First stop, 
Capua Torim.

## POINTER 2217
"The ocean is the domain 
of lusty men... Seaways 
the roads we travel..."

## POINTER 2218
The atmosphere here is nice 
enough, but the town itself 
is sort of irritating.<PAGE>This must be the influence 
of that magistrate's rule.

## POINTER 2219
"Bound by brotherhood, the men of the 
sea set sail... Upon oceans fine, 
with wind warm and sun bright..."

## POINTER 2220
Our ship is going to 
be heading south, with 
refugees onboard.<PAGE>I'm not entirely sure what our ports 
of call will be, but there's an entire 
continent down there, right?

## POINTER 2221
"Sing, join voices! Resound, o 
song of the sea! As a grand new 
world unfolds before us..."

## POINTER 2222
I saw it. I saw it, man! On our trip 
south...something that looked like a 
giant ring, just floating on the sea!<PAGE>What was it?

## POINTER 2223
"Ring, o ring on the sea! 
Say your vows to the..." 
Ah, hell. This is no time for singing.

## POINTER 2224
Just when I thought I was getting used 
to a giant ring floating on the sea, 
that thing showed up in the sky.<PAGE>What in the world's 
going on?

## POINTER 2225
I'm not in a jaunty enough 
mood to sing today. *Sigh* 
It's sad, isn't it?

## POINTER 2226
I don't know what I could have 
done, but compared to how scary 
the ocean is, this is nothing. <PAGE>It's not as if the boat 
is going to overturn.

## POINTER 2227
Oh, I'm a man of the sea... I'm 
not scared of landslides, but 
tidal waves are scary... <PAGE>I stirring up my heart 
by singing...!

## POINTER 2228
Have you seen the notice board? 
There's a new wanted man!<PAGE>It says he has long black 
hair, kind of like you!

## POINTER 2229
When I finally thought it would 
clear up, it's now this. <PAGE>This is scary, real scary. There's a lot of 
things in this world that frighten me.

## POINTER 2230
Hmm? There's a reward 
posted for Lord Ragou... <PAGE>"Ex-magistrate Ragou, 
Whereabouts Unknown! Reward For 
Information: 2000 Gald", it says.

## POINTER 2231
Ohh, how frightening. 
Do you think he 
was kidnapped?

## POINTER 2232
This one says, "Don Whitehorse Dead! 
Who Will Be His Successor?"<PAGE>If the relationship between the guilds 
and the Empire gets worse, this town 
will be the first to feel the effects.

## POINTER 2233
Ohh, how frightening. There'll be 
a war of succession. It's almost 
too frightening to think about!

## POINTER 2234
"Giant Insect Blastia 
Rampages From East To West!", 
says this one. <PAGE>I wonder if that 
was what I saw out 
on the sea...?

## POINTER 2235
Ohh, how frightening. Just think about how 
utterly squashed you'd be if something 
like that stepped on you. How terrible!

## POINTER 2236
There were people shouting, 
"Martial Law in Zaphias! 
Citizens Flee to Capua." <PAGE>I have no idea what 
they're talking about.

## POINTER 2237
Ohh, how frightening. Just think about 
how many scary people there are 
out there. It's simply horrible!

## POINTER 2238
"Ancient Relic Of The Past?! 
A Giant Palace Appears In The 
Inland Sea!", this one reads.<PAGE>Do you think the ancients 
lived beneath the sea...?

## POINTER 2239
Ohh, how frightening. I hope they don't 
discover a bunch of dead bodies there. 
Nothing could be scarier than that!

## POINTER 2240
What was that sound? 
I'm worried. <PAGE>I wish they would post news on 
the bulletin board quicker...

## POINTER 2241
I'm always here 
waiting for the 
latest news. <PAGE>I'm all a-twitter...

## POINTER 2242
"The Monster In The 
Sky: Angel Or Demon?!", 
it says.<PAGE>How could that thing possibly 
look like an angel to anybody?!

## POINTER 2243
Ohh, how frightening. I'm starting 
to think there isn't anything in 
this world that ISN'T scary!

## POINTER 2244
Clear skies are 
the bestâ™ª <PAGE>A bright sun and blue ocean 
are a match for this city!

## POINTER 2245
Welcome, welcome! City of the 
surf and sun. City of the blue 
ocean and ship's horn. <PAGE>This is Capua 
Nor.

## POINTER 2246
Originally, this was one city 
made up of Nor, Torim, and 
Duo, built on the ocean.<PAGE>I suppose it's been more than 
a hundred years since Duo 
sank to the bottom of the sea...

## POINTER 2247
You can probably see 
it from the piers.<PAGE>See what? The bridge that once 
connected Capua, Torim and Duo.

## POINTER 2248
This town owes its prosperity to the 
regular liners and trading ships.<PAGE>Of course, Ragou's control was 
more than enough to strip this 
town of all its vitality.

## POINTER 2249
Once a town loses its vitality, I'd wager it's 
an almost impossible task to get it back.

## POINTER 2250
The capital's in an 
uproar and people are 
leaving in droves.<PAGE>Some are crossing over Ehmead 
Hill and coming here.

## POINTER 2251
First, the chaos in the 
capital, now an explosion 
on Ehmead Hill. <PAGE>I heard some people were 
caught in that explosion.

## POINTER 2252
I heard they somehow repaired the barrier 
back in Zaphias, but I'm sure they're 
not taking any chances. <PAGE>We can't, either. We have 
to prepare our town for anything 
that might happen...

## POINTER 2253
It seems researchers come from 
Aspio now and again to perform 
maintenance on our blastia. <PAGE>Even so, it's pure foolish 
to have blind faith that 
everything will be all right.

## POINTER 2254
There have been a lot of small temblors 
lately. It's strange... The land 
here is historically very stable.

## POINTER 2255
We can't ignore these earthquakes any 
longer. Might they have something to 
do with the monster in the sky...?

## POINTER 2256
Aspio was right beneath where that 
tower sprang up. If I had to guess, 
I'd say it was razed to the ground.<PAGE>Who's going to do our 
blastia maintenance now...?

## POINTER 2257
At any rate, it certainly was huge. 
I wouldn't be surprised if the entire 
continent of Ilyccia sank...

## POINTER 2258
Hey. You didn't find 
any Rhybgaros? <PAGE>Wait, you did? Then 
where are they?

## POINTER 2259
Don't lie. You 
didn't find any.

## POINTER 2260
Have you seen the new magistrate 
yet? He's a young man with fair 
skin, and he seems really kind.<PAGE>Of course, I thought the old magistrate 
seemed like a nice old man 
when I first saw him, too.

## POINTER 2261
Absolute power 
corrupts absolutely.<PAGE>...That's what the knight with 
bristly green hair wearing 
a mask was saying, anyway.

## POINTER 2262
There are more Rhybgaros 
like the one brought over 
by the previous magistrate.

## POINTER 2263
"If you mix foreign animals 
in an area, this disrupts 
the local ecosystem."<PAGE>...At least, that's what the 
tied blue-hair, cool, bad-mouthed 
student said...

## POINTER 2264
I wonder if "aer" has anything 
to do with the freezing 
of the Northern Sea. <PAGE>Do you know whether the 
drift ice of frozen 
sea water is salty?

## POINTER 2265
Our very lives depend on 
the existence of "aer". 
We should be thankful.<PAGE>...That's what the pink-haired, 
Kritya-looking girl carrying 
a broom said, anyway.

## POINTER 2266
Everyone's talking about the end 
of the world lately, but...<PAGE>...Just look at how big the 
world is! Do you think it's 
really going to end so fast?

## POINTER 2267
Even if the world should be coming
to an end, we can still fight as long
as we never lose hope.<PAGE>That's what the guy with spiky
blonde hair who was calling himself
a hero was saying, anyway.

## POINTER 2268
I'm surprised!
I didn't think that a tower
would come out from there.<PAGE>I wonder who made that.

## POINTER 2269
How could I be scared? It's an 
ancient mystery and something 
that looks like a daffodil. <PAGE>That's what the silver-haired, 
loud-mouthed, female 
teacher said.

## POINTER 2270
Have you gone and climbed the tower that 
came out of the northern mountains yet?<PAGE>It looks like it's made from 
a whole bunch of other buildings 
standing together.

## POINTER 2271
I think the ancient city only looks like 
a tower from a distance because of how 
the buildings stand close together.<PAGE>...That's what the cool swordsman 
wearing a bone on his head 
was saying, anyway.

## POINTER 2272
I hate rain. However, 
I hate clear skies 
even more. <PAGE>It's so pretty and smells 
of lies that it makes 
me want to vomit.

## POINTER 2273
Although there are people who complain 
to the magistrate, it's their 
fault for not having any money.

## POINTER 2274
Barbos from the mercenary 
guild and Ragou from the 
Empire were the same. <PAGE>People with power do whatever they 
want, and then they die. Trying to 
live an honest life is pointless.

## POINTER 2275
Course, I'll never become like 
either of those guys no matter 
how much I might struggle.

## POINTER 2276
I tell you... This is one mean world... 
Heh, I guess that's not much of 
a welcome. Anyway, wanna stay?<PAGE>It's 300 Gald a night.

## POINTER 2277
<inn>Would you like to rest?

## POINTER 2278
Thank you. 
Come again.

## POINTER 2279
Welcome, welcome. It's 
300 Gald per night.

## POINTER 2280
Are you leaving? 
Please be careful.

## POINTER 2281
Oh, you've returned. 
Did you see anything 
interesting?

## POINTER 2282
Ha ha ha! Let's just take it 
easy, eh? Life is short, it 
should be spent in comfort.<PAGE>I'm not scared of the magistrate! 
I'm a noble!

## POINTER 2283
I've got money to burn! Ah, 
but you people might be poor. 
Forgive me. Ha ha ha!

## POINTER 2284
A golden light in the forest south 
of Nor Harbor. Please. 
That's just a rumor among the poor. <PAGE>I guess everyone 
likes talking 
about gold.

## POINTER 2285
A golden light moving at high 
speed in the south forest must 
be someone's delusion.

## POINTER 2286
Hah hah hah. I heard that there 
were people in town who 
cannot pay their taxes. <PAGE>If they can't pay their taxes, 
they should move somewhere 
where there are no taxes.

## POINTER 2287
I feel sorry for people 
who don't have money. 
Ho, ho, ho.

## POINTER 2288
Ho ho ho! I guess I'm 
ready to set sail.<PAGE>What? I'm sure they'd let me take 
a boat out for ten million Gald.

## POINTER 2289
Ten million Gald 
is nothing! 
Ho ho ho!

## POINTER 2290
Heh heh heh. If they won't 
let me take a boat out, I'll 
just buy off the helmsman.<PAGE>What, surely a billion 
Gald would be enough?

## POINTER 2291
A billion Gald will put a tiny 
dent in my wallet, but I may 
have no choice! Tee-hee.

## POINTER 2292
It seems it doesn't matter how much money 
I have, no ships are leaving and that's 
that. I've made my peace with it.<PAGE>Without experiences like this, 
it's impossible to find out 
how the common folk live.<PAGE>Traveling as I normally do, I'd never have 
the chance at such an important experience.

## POINTER 2293
It's the unexpected that makes travel 
so rewarding. If you think about it like 
that, it's really quite wonderful.<PAGE>Under normal cirumstances I'd never be staying 
in such accommodations, but now I might 
even start feeling attached to it.<PAGE>Don't you agree? You must, 
otherwise you wouldn't have 
set foot inside this inn.

## POINTER 2294
I think the magistrate, Ragou, 
met with great misfortune.<PAGE>He was only collecting monsters to practice 
those elegant hobbies of his.<PAGE>They may have been eccentric hobbies, but 
he was only exercising his special privileges. 
Don't you think that's charmingly grandiose?

## POINTER 2295
Can you even believe it? What has he done? 
Ragou was branded an evildoer for nothing 
more than wielding his magistratear rights.<PAGE>I really feel for this town's 
magistrate, I really do.<PAGE>You do too, yes? Yes? 
No? Of course you 
do. You must.

## POINTER 2296
All the people here are up in arms about 
the head of the Guilds passing away.<PAGE>This Empire doesn't even have 
a sitting Emperor...could things 
possibly get any worse?<PAGE>I don't have any problem with lauding the 
achievements of those that were lost, 
but there's no point grieving for them.

## POINTER 2297
The only hope left to us 
is for the people that remain 
to do what they can.<PAGE>Why has everyone forgotten 
that, preferring to simply 
drown in their tears?<PAGE>We don't need an Emperor. All 
this country needs are the 
Knights and the nobles.

## POINTER 2298
I escaped from 
Zaphias.<PAGE>What will become 
of me now?<PAGE>Here I stand, full of anxiety... 
To Be Continued.

## POINTER 2299
What do you think of my novel? 
It's based on a true story! You're 
interested in how it turns out, right?
