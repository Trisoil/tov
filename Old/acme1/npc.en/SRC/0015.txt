## POINTER 1500
What's gonna happen
to this town...

## POINTER 1501
I don't care what happens 
to the Empire.<PAGE>Something in me makes 
me wonder if that's really 
how I should feel.

## POINTER 1502
Is it wrong for me to 
think that this town is 
the only on that matters?

## POINTER 1503
I thought our only enemy
was the Empire, but then 
those monsters came...<PAGE>What should the 
guild do now?

## POINTER 1504
W-well for now, we'll 
protect this city...!

## POINTER 1505
I realized that I have to protect 
the country of my city, and 
the world of my country.<PAGE>That's what this 
guild--our guild--is for.

## POINTER 1506
You should join us. What? 
That's what your guild
does too? Then you're our rival.

## POINTER 1507
There's a tornado to the north of 
town. You value your life, right? I 
wouldn't go near it if I were you.

## POINTER 1508
I heard people have seen the shadow 
of something inside the tornado...
Something really big and tall.

## POINTER 1509
A pack of monsters is 
headed this way? Well, we 
have the barrier, don't we?<PAGE>What? The barrier's gone?
What are we going to do?!

## POINTER 1510
A pack of monsters is a 
common occurrence. But now 
that there's no barrier...

## POINTER 1511
We have to check out what's 
happening in Keiv Moc... 
I think it's southwest of the town.

## POINTER 1512
The forest of Keiv Moc is to the 
southwest of town. But I wouldn't 
go if I were you. It's dangerous.

## POINTER 1513
I wonder if war will break 
out against the Empire.<PAGE>My mother lives 
in Zaphias...

## POINTER 1514
I'm reluctant to fight in
a war against the country 
where my mother lives.

## POINTER 1515
Barbos always did have ambition... 
but I never thought he'd really 
make his move.

## POINTER 1516
He might not have used it well,
but it's rare to see a man
with that much ambition.

## POINTER 1517
The town's kind of quiet now. 
It's been way too crazy lately.

## POINTER 1518
It's not really quiet, though. 
It's just me. Just compared 
to what it has been.

## POINTER 1519
I will serve the Don
for the rest of my life.<PAGE>No matter what comes,
the Don can defeat it.

## POINTER 1520
Of course, I will become 
the Don's right hand
and prove my worth.

## POINTER 1521
All this might mean 
a war even bigger than 
the one Barbos caused.

## POINTER 1522
Palestralle is a tough enemy.
They run a whole town. 
They have a lot of resources.

## POINTER 1523
Just when I decide to serve the 
Don for the rest of my life, 
this has to go and happen...

## POINTER 1524
What did the 
Don leave us?

## POINTER 1525
Right now we have to 
concentrate all our efforts 
on preserving the Union.<PAGE>The Don wouldn't be happy with 
us crying and doing nothing.

## POINTER 1526
But I'm a girl. I cry. I just can't 
help it sometimes... Bet I could still 
take you down in one shot, though.

## POINTER 1527
This is no time to draw 
hard lines between the 
guilds and the Empire.

## POINTER 1528
The right hand and the 
left hand have to come together 
to fight the threat.<PAGE>We need to show it 
what humans can do.

## POINTER 1529
We have to see how far
our strength and power
will take us.

## POINTER 1530
Yeah, just watch what 
humans can do when our 
backs are to the wall.

## POINTER 1531
DonDonDonDonnnnnn!

## POINTER 1532
You ain't going any further.

## POINTER 1533
You want in there that bad? 
Go start some trouble outside. 
You'll wind up in there for sure.

## POINTER 1534
You know what's up 
ahead, right? It's a jail, man. 
There's nothing to see.

## POINTER 1535
Welcome. Will you 
be staying? 
That will be 400 Gald.

## POINTER 1536
<inn>Would you like to rest?ã€€

## POINTER 1537
Stop by again sometime.

## POINTER 1538
This isn't the time 
for you all to be 
lounging around!<PAGE>Run! Hurry!

## POINTER 1539
There are always monsters 
around here... We have to get 
away, quick... But to where?!

## POINTER 1540
We can't just lounge around 
at a time like this! W-we 
have to get out of here!

## POINTER 1541
What was that sound? 
Another monster attack...?

## POINTER 1542
You can't just run away 
without paying... <PAGE>Oh, you paid up front...

## POINTER 1543
Everything just feels 
so tense right now...<PAGE>What's gonna happen...?

## POINTER 1544
Sorry, everyone's so 
tense that we haven't 
made up the rooms yet.<PAGE>Could you come back 
a little later...?

## POINTER 1545
Welcome to Store #2.
We're renting out this space.

## POINTER 1546
Thanks. Everything we sell 
here is just the same as 
at Store #1! Heh heh heh.

## POINTER 1547
W-welcome. Guess 
it's not the best time 
to go shopping, but...

## POINTER 1548
Watch out for 
the monsters...!

## POINTER 1549
Welcome to Store #2.
We're renting out this space.
We got new stuff! Take a look!

## POINTER 1550
Thanks. We always 
have the same stuff 
as Store #1...

## POINTER 1551
Welcome to Store #2. 
We're renting out this space. 
We finally got some new stuff!

## POINTER 1552
Thanks.
All our new stuff is the same 
as what they got at Store #1...

## POINTER 1553
Welcome to Store #2. 
We're renting out this space. 
Our final shipment came in!!!

## POINTER 1554
*I can't talk at the 
beginning because of events.
These things happen...

## POINTER 1555
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

## POINTER 1556
The barrier disappeared?<PAGE>No good, no good.

## POINTER 1557
Now that the barrier has failed,
I guess I'll prepare my escape.

## POINTER 1558
The barrier is fixed?<PAGE>Well, isn't that nice.

## POINTER 1559
I'm glad 
I didn't start 
packing to escape.

## POINTER 1560
The Empire and the Union are 
going head-to-head?<PAGE>No good, no good.

## POINTER 1561
Is there anything 
I can do? 
...I guess not...

## POINTER 1562
Are you Mr. Barbos?<PAGE>Oh, I guess you aren't.

## POINTER 1563
Mr. Barbos
is the owner of
a rival bar.

## POINTER 1564
Are you ready to order?
No yet?
Take your time.

## POINTER 1565
Please take your time.

## POINTER 1566
You saw a bird monster? 
That's not a monster.<PAGE>Not that I know 
what it was... Maybe 
it was a monster...

## POINTER 1567
It probably doesn't 
really matter either way.

## POINTER 1568
Everyone's on edge.<PAGE>It's times like these that I 
hope the patrons will come have 
a drink and go home relaxed.

## POINTER 1569
*Sigh* I get the feeling 
that the store won't be 
very cheerful today either.

## POINTER 1570
This town's really 
lost its spirit. It 
seems so gloomy now.<PAGE>The Don was the sun 
in everyone's life.

## POINTER 1571
What this town needs 
is someone to light the 
way in place of the Don.<PAGE>You seem like that 
kind of person to me...

## POINTER 1572
Welcome. 
This is the oasis for your 
soul, Heaven's Arrow.<PAGE>Let me know whenever 
you're ready to order.

## POINTER 1573
Even if you don't become 
the sun, I thought maybe you 
could be my healing moon.

## POINTER 1574
Welcome! 
A party of one?<PAGE>Try the sweet potato. 
It's delicious!

## POINTER 1575
At times like this, we 
have to provide especially 
cheerful service.

## POINTER 1576
It seems that 
tower on Ilyccia
has been revived.<PAGE>Tarqaron... That's bad.

## POINTER 1577
Tarqaron... That kid just won't 
listen. You can't take your 
eyes off him for a second.

## POINTER 1578
Is it true?! But monsters 
can't cross the barrier... 
What?! The barrier's gone?!

## POINTER 1579
The monsters are 
coming into the town! 
This is a disaster!

## POINTER 1580
It seems we drove all 
the monsters away. 
I'm so relieved.

## POINTER 1581
But we can't let our guard down. 
The barrier may fail again.

## POINTER 1582
A little to-do with the Empire
isn't enough to shake me.
That's the way it's always been.

## POINTER 1583
Just living in this town
makes your heart strong.

## POINTER 1584
The Don's Altosk is 
the strongest guild. <PAGE>But Barbos' Blood Alliance
is no joke either.

## POINTER 1585
This city's gonna change in 
a big way if Barbos starts 
exercising his influence.

## POINTER 1586
I hear that Ragou will be
deported back to Zaphias
come tomorrow.<PAGE>I'd rather see them
cut off his head...

## POINTER 1587
The Empire's laws won't 
touch you if you're 
powerful enough.<PAGE>I wouldn't be surprised
with a complete acquittal.

## POINTER 1588
Ragou was found innocent. 
Just like I thought.<PAGE>And he ran away, 
on top of that. 
I mean, what the hell?!

## POINTER 1589
In any case, after all the 
pain he's caused, someone 
will eventually get to him.

## POINTER 1590
There's talk 
of a monster that's 
unbelievably huge.

## POINTER 1591
That's probably not 
just any old monster...

## POINTER 1592
I heard about how 
Harry's blunder caused 
Belius' death.<PAGE>That's not good
for the Don.

## POINTER 1593
That could be really 
bad for the Don.

## POINTER 1594
The Don's death is 
unfortunate, but there was 
nothing anyone could do.<PAGE>He made a good decision
and the town was protected.

## POINTER 1595
The town lost it's 
foundation, but we must 
live on. For the Don.

## POINTER 1596
I heard Alexei caused 
a rebellion in Zaphias.<PAGE>What could have happened 
within the Imperial Knights?

## POINTER 1597
I can't begin to guess the source of 
Alexei's unhappiness, but I'm sure 
it must have been gut-wrenching.

## POINTER 1598
I never thought 
the world could be 
destroyed so easily.<PAGE>But seeing that huge monster... 
It seems all too real now.

## POINTER 1599
A monster that would eat the 
world... An entire planet... 
Must be really hungry...
