## POINTER 5700
If I become a Knight, will 
I get that strong and be able 
to win that many fights?

## POINTER 5701
Those Knights were so cool. They took down all 
the monsters in the coliseum, just like that.<PAGE>That horn's pretty 
sweet, too.â™ª

## POINTER 5702
You never can be too sure about people 
who don't have horns, I always say.

## POINTER 5703
Hey, hey, are the Knights bad 
guys, or something? That's 
what the grown-ups said.<PAGE>It's too bad that the cool-looking 
guys have to be the bad ones.

## POINTER 5704
I guess it's okay to have cool-looking 
villains too, though.

## POINTER 5705
The town's quieted down thanks 
to the work the Knights did.<PAGE>That settles it, they're cool in my book. 
...Woops... If my mom hears me say 
that, she'll box my ears for sure.

## POINTER 5706
I guess not everyone's as big a fan 
of the Knights as I am, huh? I guess 
that's 'cause they're bad guys.

## POINTER 5707
Forget being a hero of the coliseum, 
I'm gonna be a hero of the Knights!<PAGE>That sounds way more fun, anyway. 
Wonder if Mom will let me.

## POINTER 5708
I've gotta start saving money 
so I can go to the capital...<PAGE>Oh wait, I forgot 
I've gotta grow 
up first...

## POINTER 5709
Some tournaments pit humans against other 
humans, while others have humans squaring 
off against monster opponents.<PAGE>There are many monsters 
kept here at the coliseum 
for that purpose.

## POINTER 5710
Monsters can be brought within 
the barrier if a special formula 
is applied to their bodies.<PAGE>Take a close look at the monsters 
in the coliseum and you'll see tattoos 
etched into their hides.

## POINTER 5711
Some nut job smashed the blastia 
that keeps the monsters locked 
up. Who the hell would 
do a thing like that?

## POINTER 5712
They busted up all the reverse 
barriers like nothing.<PAGE>That's not the kind of power 
you take lightly...

## POINTER 5713
This town's always enjoyed independence under Palestralle. 
The guild has always made sure peace is maintained here.<PAGE>We'll be lucky if things don't get out 
of control with all these Knights around, 
but I wouldn't hold your breath.

## POINTER 5714
Palestralle's managed things 
just fine in Nordopolica 
on its own until now.<PAGE>If the empire tries to force their 
way of doing things on the people 
here, I'd get ready for fireworks.

## POINTER 5715
Are those bloody Knights not gonna 
be happy 'til they've taken 
total control of the city?<PAGE>They've got battleships on the water, 
and Knights all over the streets... 
What'll become of the coliseum?

## POINTER 5716
If the coliseum falls into the hands 
of the empire, it's going to get real 
boring around here, real fast.<PAGE>This town'll get so tied up in rules and red 
tape, it's days'll be all but numbered.

## POINTER 5717
The Knights and Palestralle were 
butting heads over who'd handle 
security around the coliseum.<PAGE>We ended up settling it over a game of 
rock, paper, scissors, I kid you not.

## POINTER 5718
We ended up losing, so we had to give the 
job to the Knights. Man, playing rock, 
paper, scissors sure was fun, though...<PAGE>I know it's 
just a game, 
but still...

## POINTER 5719
There've been increasing problems between the Knights 
and the people since the armored heroes arrived, 
but things are quieter here on the whole.<PAGE>That might only be because there are more 
watchful eyes out there, though.

## POINTER 5720
There's never been a time when the Knights 
have been very welcome in Nordopolica.<PAGE>Still, at some point we'll have to 
admit that certain things have improved 
since they've been here.

## POINTER 5721
It's not like all the Knights 
are bad eggs, as a rule.<PAGE>If you actually listen to them talk, quite a few 
of them aren't bad at all. Everybody's some mother's 
child at one time or another, after all.

## POINTER 5722
The Knights on the bottom aren't 
to blame, it's the nature of the 
organization that's the problem.

## POINTER 5723
If you head in there, you'll find 
the tournament registration desk.<PAGE>Wondering why I told you that? I could tell 
right off the bat you were here to sign up 
by those weapons you've got, that's why.

## POINTER 5724
Money and prizes are all 
well and good, but don't 
over-extend yourselves.<PAGE>The monsters you'll run 
into here are nothing 
to shake a stick at.

## POINTER 5725
On the other side of the mountains 
off to the west of here, there's 
a desert oasis called Mantaic.<PAGE>If it truly is an oasis, it must 
have a huge lake, like a shimmering 
blue jewel in a sea of sand.

## POINTER 5726
It's got to be blazing hot though, and 
you'd have to survive the treacherous 
mountain road that gets you there.

## POINTER 5727
The town of Mantaic used to be a free 
land, meaning neither the empire nor 
the guilds had any presence there.<PAGE>From what I heard though, this creep of 
a magistrate they had for a while put 
it under the control of the Knights.

## POINTER 5728
Now that the Knights are here 
as well, we're in the same boat 
as they are in Mantaic.<PAGE>I can't help feeling sorry for them.

## POINTER 5729
Since the Knights have arrived 
Belius has died and the 
monsters have gone crazy.<PAGE>Now one of their guys is hogging the champion 
spot in the tournaments. What next?

## POINTER 5730
Ohh, I hope they'll be leaving 
soon, the bullies.

## POINTER 5731
I saw this gigantic 
insect marching around 
on the the ocean.<PAGE>Could I have been dreaming...? 
Still, it all 
seemed so real.

## POINTER 5732
An insect... That's it. 
It was a big beetle.<PAGE>A giant beetle walking on the ocean... 
Wow... Just listen to me.

## POINTER 5733
It's hard to tell when they're bundled 
up in all that metal, but they're barely 
more than children, aren't they?<PAGE>Without the armor they look about 
the same age as my boy who's gone 
off to train in Dahngrest.

## POINTER 5734
Ohh, there I go thinking 
about my son again.<PAGE>They've all got mothers like 
me I'm sure, just waiting for 
their boys to come home safe.

## POINTER 5735
It must be ages since 
they've had a good 
home-cooked meal.<PAGE>I brought them some rice balls 
and miso soup, and they 
ate up every last bite.

## POINTER 5736
I'm glad they seemed 
to enjoy it so much.<PAGE>Maybe I'll bake them my 
peach cobbler, next.

## POINTER 5737
This is the counter for single 
applicants.<PAGE>Applications are not being 
accepted at this time.

## POINTER 5738
Applications will be accepted 
tomorrow at 9 a.m.<PAGE>Please rest for tonight and 
come again tomorrow.

## POINTER 5739
This is the counter for single 
applicants.<PAGE>Applications are not being accepted at this time.

## POINTER 5740
You want to fight in the tournament? 
Did you think you can fight in the middle 
of the night?

## POINTER 5741
I work at the application counter. 
At night, I'm a singer!

## POINTER 5742
This is the registration desk 
for a new style of tournament.<PAGE>We ask for your patience as we finish 
the necessary preparations.

## POINTER 5743
I'm terribly sorry, but you'll have 
to wait a while longer, yet.<PAGE>We will make an announcement once all 
preparations have been completed.

## POINTER 5744
Got everything in order? If you 
follow this hall straight ahead, 
you'll come out in the coliseum.<PAGE>There's no shame in backing out if 
you're having second thoughts. We can't 
refund your entry fee, though.

## POINTER 5745
These are the private quarters of 
Palestralle's Duce Belius.<PAGE>Only those who have been granted 
special permission may pass.

## POINTER 5746
There are only a handful of people who hold 
the privilege of meeting with Belius.<PAGE>She normally refuses holding 
audience with anyone at all.

## POINTER 5747
Palestralle is organizing their elites 
to put down the distrubance at the coliseum.<PAGE>Evacuate in an 
orderly way 
or you'll get hurt.

## POINTER 5748
Duce Belius 
is busy working on a response 
to this emergency.<PAGE>Do not disturb her!

## POINTER 5749
I'm not afraid... 
I'm not afraid...<PAGE>I can do this... I know 
I can do this...

## POINTER 5750
I... I gave up my life in the 
capital, and moved out here...<PAGE>M-monsters? L-l-let 
me at 'em.

## POINTER 5751
I'm tough... I'm really strong... 
I'm the strongest guy in the 
world... No, the universe...

## POINTER 5752
Oh, what's the use...? I've 
never been all that strong. 
Maybe this is a bad idea...

## POINTER 5753
I'm overflowing with strength... If I were 
an engine, I'd be a million horsepower...<PAGE>Tear a monster to shreds, 
throw it aside, tear, throw... 
Okay, I've got it...!

## POINTER 5754
I've got this image training 
stuff down pat...<PAGE>Oh, but... Man, I guess I'm still scared...

## POINTER 5755
There I am. I'm standing... I've won... 
I've defeated my opponent...<PAGE>This should be a cinch for me...!

## POINTER 5756
*Sigh* It was easy enough 
to take first place...when 
it was in my head...

## POINTER 5757
I'm the greatest...! Totally 
excellent! So buff! You're 
all nothin' but trash...!

## POINTER 5758
I feel like I've gotten stronger...just 
by changing the way I talk...<PAGE>At least...it feels that way...

## POINTER 5759
I'm gonna get stronger... 
Get stronger... Stronger... 
Zzz...

## POINTER 5760
...Whoa...! I must've 
hypnotized myself. Am 
I getting desperate...?

## POINTER 5761
I guess... I'm just no 
good... I...I want to go 
back to the capital...

## POINTER 5762
What I wouldn't give for a nice fluffy 
bed... A delicious, home-cooked meal... 
I'm through living the hard life...

## POINTER 5763
A top-notch fighter 
can dodge a monster's 
attacks with style.<PAGE>All the pretty ladies can't take their 
eyes off him. And he gets to take that 
home with 'im when the fighting's done!

## POINTER 5764
A top-notch fighter can 
make people laugh at the 
stupidest jokes... <PAGE>And still slice through his opponents 
with the greatest of ease!

## POINTER 5765
A top-notch fighter doesn't 
let a little drinking 
dull his blade.<PAGE>He feigns drunkenness, catches his 
opponents off-guard, and adds a new 
technique to his bag of tricks!

## POINTER 5766
A top-notch fighter never 
minces his words.<PAGE>He howls as he clashes with his 
foes, and roars when he's victorious. 
It drives the ladies crazy!

## POINTER 5767
A top-notch fighter seeks not glory, 
and lives in the shadows.<PAGE>He'll show his face only when his 
lover's in danger, dispatch his 
foe, and be gone like the wind!

## POINTER 5768
A top-notch fighter greets hardship and sadness with 
a smile, and fights the good fight in silence.<PAGE>The tears in his eyes when he's 
won the day capture the hearts 
of women everywhere!

## POINTER 5769
Though a top-notch fighter 
may be clumsy, he'd 
never let it show.<PAGE>He draws the attention of all those watching, 
and ends with a dazzling flourish!

## POINTER 5770
A top-notch fighter never boasts of his skills, 
but simply does all that he is able.<PAGE>When the moment comes, he taps into 
his hidden strength, and dispatches 
his opponent in a flash!

## POINTER 5771
A top-notch fighter is a man of 
few words, though he attends 
well to the words of others.<PAGE>He'll turn on the charm, and before you 
know it you're his friend for life!

## POINTER 5772
A top-notch fighter denies neither 
the strength of his opponents, 
nor his own shortcomings.<PAGE>He accepts facts as facts, and sets 
his sights on the highest peaks!

## POINTER 5773
A top-notch fighter puts his own 
needs last, and makes keeping 
others from harm his priority.<PAGE>But even when he's aiding others, he's taking 
care of his own business all the while!

## POINTER 5774
A top-notch fighter 
lives by his beliefs.<PAGE>He is not tainted by haste nor envy...<PAGE>But lets his passion burn like a smoldering flame!

## POINTER 5775
I'd give anything to become a top-notch fighter 
myself. I wonder if I've got what it takes...

## POINTER 5776
If you desire an audience with Belius, you 
had best come on the night of the new moon.<PAGE>On that day, Belius will meet 
with servants of the Don 
who bear his messages.

## POINTER 5777
The evening of the new moon is the 
only chance you'll have to meet 
with Belius. Begone until then.

## POINTER 5778
As a special favor, Belius has granted you all 
the privilege of standing in her presence.<PAGE>You should give thanks 
for this kindness.

## POINTER 5779
Belius awaits within. Enter.

## POINTER 5780
...You may enter, but Belius 
no longer... You understand, 
I'm sure...

## POINTER 5781
You may enter, but do not 
disturb the surroundings.

## POINTER 5782
Ahead are the chambers Natz 
is using as the offices 
of the provisional Duce.<PAGE>Enter now if you have 
business here.

## POINTER 5783
Unlike Belius, Natz has 
decided to make his chambers 
open to the public.<PAGE>You are free to enter as you like.

## POINTER 5784
Ahead you will find the office 
of our provisional Duce, Natz.<PAGE>You are free to enter as you like.

## POINTER 5785
Make sure and knock before entering 
the room. Knock twice.

## POINTER 5786
This room belongs to Natz, the provisional 
Duce who, once enough time has passed, will 
one day be the Duce of Nordopolica.<PAGE>It looks as though Belius' 
private chambers will see no 
interruption in their use.

## POINTER 5787
I should be on security detail in 
the capital right about now. What 
did I get sent here for, anyway.<PAGE>I'll bet it was Lieutenant Leblanc's idea 
to bring me along... There's no rhyme or 
reason to that buffoon's decisions...!

## POINTER 5788
He's not all that bad of a guy, but I always seem 
to wind up bad-mouthing him nonetheless...

## POINTER 5789
No milling around at night!

## POINTER 5790
Anyone acting shady will be arrested!

## POINTER 5791
The time of day has no meaning in a crisis situation!

## POINTER 5792
Chaaarge!!

## POINTER 5793
The line between the possible and the impossible is as thin as a single 
sheet of paper. So too the line that separates life from death...

## POINTER 5794
Don't say you can't 
do it, just do it! <PAGE>You can do it if you 
think you can!

## POINTER 5795
Is it not only human for a person 
to use their humanity to make 
something of themselves?

## POINTER 5796
People who accomplish 
nothing are losers! <PAGE>Are you one of those 
kinds of people?!

## POINTER 5797
Do you know what it 
means to be a sucker?<PAGE>A real sucker is someone who faces 
life's challenges with no hope 
of winning from the outset.

## POINTER 5798
There are piles of born losers 
just like that in this town.

## POINTER 5799
You guys should just 
keep on working. <PAGE>Happiness comes 
even to little 
worker bees.
