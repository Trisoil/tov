## POINTER 5000
No matter how many new magistrates they 
send us, they'll have a helluva time tryin' 
to beat the freedom of the old days.

## POINTER 5001
I hear that Don 
Whitehorse has 
passed on.<PAGE>I used to take care of that 
guy, back when we were just 
runts. Honest to goodness.

## POINTER 5002
There was a time when the Don 
was livin' with some relatives 
of mine in town here.<PAGE>He was five and I was eight. 
Heh, he used to look up 
to me in those days...

## POINTER 5003
You know, life might just be easier in 
a different town. I've caught myself 
thinkin' that any number of times...<PAGE>I'm past the age 
for pickin' up and 
movin', though.

## POINTER 5004
All my old friends from this town 
have passed on now. I've got nothin' 
tyin' me to this place anymore.<PAGE>Come to think of it...I've got nothin' 
tyin' me to this world anymore, either.

## POINTER 5005
I've heard there was a place called 
Duo between Torim and Nor that sank 
sometime before I was born.<PAGE>To think that I'd see the day when 
it'd rise back up... I've really 
been around quite a while.

## POINTER 5006
Huh? That thing floatin' on the 
the waves isn't Duo, you say?<PAGE>Well then, what is it?

## POINTER 5007
The sky's gone and cracked... The 
strangest things have been happenin' 
one right on top of the next.<PAGE>A life long lived never ceases to amaze.

## POINTER 5008
Whoo boy, a life long lived never ceases to amaze.

## POINTER 5009
What a shock! What right's a tower 
that size got to come juttin' 
out of a mountain like that?!<PAGE>Life never ceases to amaze.

## POINTER 5010
Wonder just what we've got 
in store for us next.<PAGE>Heh, I can hardly wait!â™ª

## POINTER 5011
So it seems that towns with a strong imperial 
presence enjoy greater peace and stability.

## POINTER 5012
We can walk free of worry in the 
streets. What could be more splendid 
than that? Wouldn't you agree?

## POINTER 5013
The actions of this magistrate, 
Ragou, are inexcusable. He has 
sullied the empire's good name.

## POINTER 5014
Such a man is the exception to the 
rule, though. Surely the next magistrate 
will set the record straight.

## POINTER 5015
If the Don dies, I can't see 
how the guild Union can escape 
suffering as a result.<PAGE>At any rate, it should help shore up the welfare 
of the empire, and of this town as well.

## POINTER 5016
Now is the time when the empire should 
use its authority to reclaim direct 
control over Capua Torim.<PAGE>It would seem that neither the Council nor 
the Knights are eager to take action.

## POINTER 5017
Alexei may have once been the proud leader 
of the Imperial Knights, but he was proven to 
be nothing but a lowly coward in the end.<PAGE>He was never cut out to 
be a leader among men.

## POINTER 5018
If only we could have someone such 
as Sir Cumore, with an unimpeachably 
noble pedigree, here.

## POINTER 5019
This young knight, Sir <STR>(FRE), is 
truly quite capable, is he not?<PAGE>I can speak no ill of him, though 
he cannot claim a noble upbringing.

## POINTER 5020
Still, he can be no match for 
the likes of Sir Cumore.<PAGE>There is a knight who 
surely has no equal.

## POINTER 5021
How long must we wait until the 
next emperor ascends the throne?<PAGE>If only the matter of ascension could 
be settled, then surely this disorder 
would be eased somewhat.

## POINTER 5022
Be it His Highness Ioder, or some 
other candidate, the important 
thing is naming a successor...

## POINTER 5023
The situation outside the town appears quite dire. 
Things remain quite peaceful within, however.<PAGE>The low-born commoners do raise 
a panic from time to time...

## POINTER 5024
We have a barrier here. 
We shall be safe, 
come what may.

## POINTER 5025
I've got to get 
to the capital.<PAGE>I have to protect 
the gel factory...

## POINTER 5026
I wonder if going to the capital would 
mean leaving my husband behind...

## POINTER 5027
There's no telling when the 
supply of gels might run out, 
so I'm keeping a lookout.<PAGE>...It looks like things 
are still okay.

## POINTER 5028
If it looks like they're selling out, maybe 
I should just buy up the whole stock. 
But where will I get the money...?

## POINTER 5029
If the world is falling apart, it's no 
time to worry about gels, is it...?

## POINTER 5030
If that thing in the sky were to 
break apart, it might just turn 
into giant chunks of gel...

## POINTER 5031
This may not be the time to be calmly eating gel.

## POINTER 5032
Gels? Oh, I'm all through 
with that. Bottles are where 
it's at these days.

## POINTER 5033
Holy bottles and dark bottles. 
Who needs gels as long 
as I've got those two.

## POINTER 5034
Basically speaking, 
launching boats 
at night is 
forbidden.<PAGE>Even if that weren't the case, the port has been 
closed down on account of the recent storms.

## POINTER 5035
Whether the sun's rising or setting,
it's rain, rain, and more rain.<PAGE>It really gets you down after a while.

## POINTER 5036
I hear those mermen don't sleep at night. They'll 
attack a ship after dark as soon as during the day.<PAGE>They've gotta sleep 
sometime, right...?

## POINTER 5037
Do you think maybe they 
work in shifts...?

## POINTER 5038
My word, this view is 
simply breathtaking.<PAGE>Gazing out at this scenery, the 
trials and tribulations of daily 
life seem to melt away.

## POINTER 5039
What can be waiting across
this ocean, I wonder.

## POINTER 5040
A new magistrate, you 
say? And what of it?<PAGE>I should think such matters 
are of no concern to me.

## POINTER 5041
Whiling away my days gazing out at the 
sea is complete and utter bliss.

## POINTER 5042
It's so hot out today. Twice, no 
it's three times as hot as usual.<PAGE>Ooh... How I'd love 
to swim in the sea...

## POINTER 5043
Let's see, did I bring my bathing suit...? 
Not sure I feel like showing off my 
arms though... You know how it is.

## POINTER 5044
That cloud there, it looks just like the whipped 
cream on a strawberry short cake...<PAGE>N-no! What am I saying...?!

## POINTER 5045
I'll surely lose some weight if only I can keep 
my determination. I have the most marvelous getaway 
planned for the beach here this summer...

## POINTER 5046
Things got a bit boisterous when 
some other people arrived, 
but the calm has returned.<PAGE>This beach is mine alone, and I won't 
stand sharing it with others.

## POINTER 5047
...If there's anything I simply 
cannot stand, it's noise...

## POINTER 5048
I've claimed this 
spot as my own private 
luxury box...<PAGE>What cares do I have about the world and it's 
troubles, so long as I have this view?

## POINTER 5049
The sky? My eyes refuse 
to see anything that 
might upset me.

## POINTER 5050
How long will I be able to 
remain here gazing out at 
this impeccable scene?<PAGE>Oh, would that 
this moment could 
last a thousand 
eons.

## POINTER 5051
Ahh, this rich tableau... Simply 
marvelous... It's as though 
I were within a dream...

## POINTER 5052
Looks like the empire's got 
plans to lock down Nordopolica 
using its battleships.<PAGE>It's just awful, the way they throw their 
weight around like that, if you ask me.

## POINTER 5053
There's no way the guilds stand 
a chance if the empire really gets 
serious about wiping them out.

## POINTER 5054
The Knights have been launching 
boats, even after it gets dark.<PAGE>Those guys are asking for trouble if 
they try to get a boat out on the 
water in the middle of the night.

## POINTER 5055
The Knights are amateurs when it comes to the 
ocean. They'd do well to hire some sailors who 
specialize in this stuff. You know, like me.

## POINTER 5056
You'll never see more stars than when 
you're out on the ocean. There's hundreds 
of times more than in any city.<PAGE>Navigating the sea at night's not 
for amateurs though, mind you.

## POINTER 5057
You've never lived 'til you've seen 
the night sky from out on the ocean.

## POINTER 5058
Does that glittering land shine 
even in the dark of night?<PAGE>I'd love to go see for myself.

## POINTER 5059
Is that island a product of all the disturbances 
the world's been experiencing lately?

## POINTER 5060
If the continents themselves 
were to sink, what would 
all the people do?<PAGE>It's not like we could just pile everybody 
into a bunch of boats...

## POINTER 5061
Hey, we could build cities 
on the ocean floor, and have 
everybody move down there.<PAGE>...Or maybe not.

## POINTER 5062
......<PAGE>Unless you've got business with the magistrate, 
you'd best show yourselves out.

## POINTER 5063
Don't want to get yerselves hurt now, 
do you? Then you'd be wise to beat it.

## POINTER 5064
......<PAGE>The magistrate's sleeping. 
Come back tomorrow.

## POINTER 5065
I don't think you want 
to see me angry.

## POINTER 5066
......The magistrate's 
sleeping. Come 
back tomorrow.

## POINTER 5067
Knock off that racket. Who 
the hell are you, anyway?

## POINTER 5068
......<PAGE>The magistrate? He went 
back to the capital. 
The exit's that way.

## POINTER 5069
I've got no time to 
play games with you.

## POINTER 5070
......<PAGE>The magistrate isn't 
in. Beat it.

## POINTER 5071
I told you to beat 
it, so scram!

## POINTER 5072
......<PAGE>No meeting with the magistrate 
after dark. Beat it.

## POINTER 5073
I'm tired, and that's got 
me in a bad mood. Next time 
I see you, you're dead!

## POINTER 5074
Yo punk... Just keep pressing 
your luck... Find 
out what happens...

## POINTER 5075
This is magistrate Ragou's mansion. 
There's no entry at this hour, 
even if you've got permission.

## POINTER 5076
I can't let you in, even if 
you've been given permission.<PAGE>We've got strict instructions 
to admit no one while the 
magistrate's sleeping.

## POINTER 5077
Once we've been hired, we've got no choice 
to do what we've been paid for, no matter 
what sort of guy the magistrate might be.

## POINTER 5078
If you've got business with the magistrate, 
why not use your head a little 
and come at a more normal hour?

## POINTER 5079
Welcome, welcome. One night 
will set you back 300 Gald.

## POINTER 5080
Thank you. Come stay 
with us again.

## POINTER 5081
Ready to depart?
Take care!

## POINTER 5082
I hope there was something
that caught your interest.

## POINTER 5083
Hah hah hah. Come on, take it easy. 
Life's too short to do anything 
but slow down and enjoy the ride.

## POINTER 5084
I'm frightened sometimes when I think about how 
rich I am. Oh my, I forgot that you all might 
be poor. How terribly rude of me. Hah hah.

## POINTER 5085
Hoh hoh, how long until 
we set sail, I wonder.<PAGE>Surely 10 million Gald would convince 
them to get started early.

## POINTER 5086
I'm afraid 10 million 
Gald is mere pocket change 
to me, hoh hoh.

## POINTER 5087
Heh heh. If they refuse to 
launch the ship, I'll just 
have to buy the helmsman.<PAGE>Or perhaps you don't think 100 million 
Gald will be sufficient.

## POINTER 5088
I'll feel the pinch of 100 million 
Gald, to be sure, but what choice 
do I have, really? Heh heh.

## POINTER 5089
No matter how much money one has, if the boat 
won't sail, there's no point worrying over 
it. Perhaps this is as it should be.<PAGE>Without such inconveniences, 
how else could I experience 
the lives of the 
common people?

## POINTER 5090
Travel is a thing to be savored. 
If you adopt this mindset, everything 
takes on a special appeal.<PAGE>Though I will surely not stay here again, 
even this clap-board shack of an inn 
has worked its quaint charms on me.<PAGE>I'm sure you agree. Perhaps 
that's just what brought us 
to it in the first place.

## POINTER 5091
We mustn't forget that Ragou's position 
as magistrate was not without its perils.<PAGE>I refer, of course, to the monsters he 
gathered to pursue his refined hobbies.<PAGE>His tastes may run to the eccentric, and 
his vision, a bit grandiose, but he simply 
exercised the privilege of his station.

## POINTER 5092
And now he's been branded a villain 
for "abusing his authority" 
or some such nonsense.<PAGE>Honestly, the magistrate of this 
town deserves our sympathies.<PAGE>Don't you think so, too? You 
do, right? Don't you? Oh, 
silly me, of course you do.

## POINTER 5093
The chief of the guilds has died, they say. Everyone 
seems to be in quite a panic over it.<PAGE>But I ask you; can there be any 
sadness that exceeds this country's 
current lack of an emperor?<PAGE>Praising the achievements of the deceased 
is one thing, but mourning their 
loss won't bring them back.

## POINTER 5094
Those of us that remain must 
carry on. It's really the only 
hope that we're left with.<PAGE>These people are so caught 
up in their weeping, they've 
forgotten this fact.<PAGE>We don't really need an emperor, when it comes 
down to it. The empire will be just fine led 
by the Knights and the nobility alone.

## POINTER 5095
The capital's a mess. Nobody'll 
even go near it, now. Man, 
what am I gonna do? <PAGE>When times are uncertain, 
you've got to move on to 
the next chapter.

## POINTER 5096
What will become of my true-crime novel, 
though...? Even I couldn't wait to 
see what was gonna happen next.

## POINTER 5097
At that very moment, word came 
that the ship his friend had 
been aboard, had sunk!<PAGE>His dear companion's life stolen by none other than 
the black shadow draped across the ocean's expanse! 
Whatever shall he do, meek and powerless as he is?!

## POINTER 5098
As night bears down upon him, how shall 
he find the light of a new day?!

## POINTER 5099
Alone, save for the trusty blade 
at my side, I leap onto the 
foul sky monster's back.<PAGE>A slash and a hack and 
a blur of steel!<PAGE>In no time at all, the monster's 
hide has been rent, and I stand 
over the beast, victorious!
