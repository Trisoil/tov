## POINTER 4100
Maybe the Empire
will fall just like 
the Union, eh?

## POINTER 4101
When the day comes that 
monstrous hand comes down, 
we'll all be flattened.

## POINTER 4102
It's one thing to be enthusiastic, 
I guess, but we're kind of short on people...

## POINTER 4103
If only I had gone 
back to Dahngrest, I could have 
seen the Don...

## POINTER 4104
I went to see what things were like in Nor. 
A friend of mine contacted me, 
saying it was really bad in Zaphias.

## POINTER 4105
If we play our cards right, 
we might be able to 
make our Guild famous...

## POINTER 4106
Do you think we could be one 
of the Five Master Guilds
if we killed that thing in the sky?

## POINTER 4107
No, no, wait, wait... 
Look at reality, man. 
There's no way to beat that thing.

## POINTER 4108
Ooh, hello, you cuties. 
How'd you like a game with 
little old me?♪<PAGE>If you think I'll be a pushover 
just because I'm a woman... 
you're going to get burned!∀

## POINTER 4109
You cuties 
look strong.<PAGE>Just my 
type. ∀

## POINTER 4110
Recently, I've been growing 
tired of the men in this port.

## POINTER 4111
All the guys here just don't have any 
energy lately. It's so irritating.

## POINTER 4112
All people eventually die. 
The Don, me, you.

## POINTER 4113
If your spirits are down, 
the only thing to do is play. 
How about it? Like a match?

## POINTER 4114
I thought the Commandant
was just the Empire's a dog... <PAGE>But he really 
proved his worth 
in the rebellion!

## POINTER 4115
Will you join me 
in the rebellion?

## POINTER 4116
Ahhh, with him gone, 
I feel drained...
and bored.

## POINTER 4117
I was wandering through the forest and 
became lost in some old ruins...<PAGE>It was there I heard 
the unnatural howling of 
some frightful beast!

## POINTER 4118
There's no doubt in my mind... 
it was the legendary monster, Euma.

## POINTER 4119
I heard a voice in the old ruins in 
the forest, but when I returned a little 
while ago, the voice was gone...<PAGE>I wonder if the monster 
has gone...

## POINTER 4120
But it was definitely 
the Euma, I know 
I'm right!

## POINTER 4121
I have dedicated 
all my life to 
hunting the Euma!

## POINTER 4122
Hey you there, you've got 
a book on monsters right, 
can you give it to me?<PAGE> What? You can't...

## POINTER 4123
I thought it had 
information on the Euma......<PAGE>What? there's nothing?
......what a crock!

## POINTER 4124
I swear to you, I will find a Euma! Then 
those foolish believers in common sense 
will see just how wrong they are!

## POINTER 4125
There, in the sky! 
That's it! Verily, 
the legendary Euma!

## POINTER 4126
Verily......
hmm.......
Is that really a Euma......?<PAGE>Are there really such 
things as Eumas...?

## POINTER 4127
Euma......
Why did this get 
me so excited ?

## POINTER 4128
Aaaargh! My stupid grandchild! 
She's crazy about this Aifread! <PAGE>He's just a 
useless pirate!

## POINTER 4129
I know it's just a youthful crush 
but should I keep watching over her?

## POINTER 4130
Aaaargh! My stupid grandchild! 
She wants to be a man of the sea?! 
That's no job for a woman! <PAGE>Bah! She's just a carefree 
little troublemaker!

## POINTER 4131
Perhaps it's my fault... 
I spoiled her and 
bought her a ship...

## POINTER 4132
Aifread brought the Don
and Belius together in friendship.<PAGE>They really respected 
him for that......

## POINTER 4133
Now there's no Don, 
no Belius, no Aifread...<PAGE>Ahhh... the grim reaper will be coming 
for these old bones soon enough...

## POINTER 4134
My fool granddaughter's out on the 
sea again today, even though that 
fearsome thing's in the sky.

## POINTER 4135
Am I crazy too...?

## POINTER 4136
My senile old gramps forgot 
that he gave me a ship!<PAGE>But when I use it he lectures me 
and goes on and on about 
the dangers of the sea......

## POINTER 4137
I want to be king of the pirates 
just like Aifread...

## POINTER 4138
Aifread died protecting 
his friends and crew...<PAGE>Ahhh, he's truly a 
man amongst men...

## POINTER 4139
I want to be like Aifread...! 
There's no reason why a woman 
can't be a man of the sea!

## POINTER 4140
The king of the pirates from 
olden times is ancient history... 
Is this still true...?

## POINTER 4141
Yeah, yeah, I know 
the sea is dangerous!

## POINTER 4142
My gramps went to 
sea years ago. <PAGE>Why can't I have 
the same freedom...?

## POINTER 4143
Why on earth 
can't he 
trust me!?

## POINTER 4144
Why do I go out on the ocean 
even though gramps doesn't approve? 
To achieve his dreams.<PAGE>I'm going to achieve the 
dreams he had when 
he was a sailor.

## POINTER 4145
I'm too embarrassed to 
tell my gramps that I want 
to live out his dreams.

## POINTER 4146
No matter how great the danger 
in the sky, I will get out on the sea!<PAGE>I will face up to the danger 
just like a true king of the pirates!

## POINTER 4147
Wasn't it my grandfather's 
dream to be just like 
a true king of the pirates...?

## POINTER 4148
My father and my daughter 
are so quick to argue.<PAGE>I wish they'd just get along... 
they're so alike, those two.

## POINTER 4149
Recently my 
daughter and my father 
have been pretty down.<PAGE>Maybe because the Don
and Belius are dead...

## POINTER 4150
Honestly, I couldn't care less 
about the Don and Belius.

## POINTER 4151
They're just too embarrassed to 
sit down and have a face-to-face.

## POINTER 4152
Not that she's the kind of girl 
who'd ever listen to what I had to say.

## POINTER 4153
Well well, hello again. 
We met at Deidon Hold, didn't we?<PAGE>Have you finally decided 
to work for us?

## POINTER 4154
.........

## POINTER 4155
You never realize how 
important someone is until 
they're gone, do you?

## POINTER 4156
The Empire's in a panic right now. 
If we trade smart during the aftermath, 
it'll mean huge profit.

## POINTER 4157
The Knights or His Royal Highness... 
which is the more valuable property? 
I'm considering what to invest in...

## POINTER 4158
With so many strange goings on, 
it's not exactly easy doing business lately.

## POINTER 4159
When did the Guilds
become little more 
than volunteers?<PAGE>We've taken huge losses 
because we've been sending 
relief supplies for free...

## POINTER 4160
This is giving me a headache... But 
in my heart I am feeling a little 
warmer... What could this be...?

## POINTER 4161
This is Fortune's Market 
headquarters.<PAGE>The President is not here right 
now. What do you want?

## POINTER 4162
This is Fortune's Market 
headquarters.<PAGE>The President is not here right 
now. Get to the point.

## POINTER 4163
The Don's death has 
had quite an effect on 
Fortune's Market, too.

## POINTER 4164
The President is even busier than usual. 
She probably won't be back for quite a while.

## POINTER 4165
The President has an uncanny nose 
for sniffing out profits.

## POINTER 4166
The President is hard at work again today. 
I don't know when she'll be back.

## POINTER 4167
The President has been in a good mood recently. 
She's had a lot of money spinning ideas, 
and our financial situation is looking good.

## POINTER 4168
She may be the President, but 
she helps people out. That's 
what makes her so wonderful.

## POINTER 4169
She isn't the kind of person that would 
demand payback once the dust 
had settled, either....I don't think...

## POINTER 4170
...This town is so 
nice to live in...<PAGE>The people are kind, the weather not 
too hot, not too cold...and best 
of all...the President isn't here...

## POINTER 4171
Just between us......<PAGE>The President smells 
so nice...

## POINTER 4172
I stand at the President's side. 
There could be no greater happiness......<PAGE>But she is not 
here right now...

## POINTER 4173
Just between us......<PAGE>The President really, really hates 
being called "ma'am".

## POINTER 4174
The President is 
not here right now...<PAGE>There is nothing sadder 
in this world.

## POINTER 4175
Just between us......<PAGE>The President loves money.

## POINTER 4176
Alexei's just 
a con man! <PAGE>He fooled everyone, going 
on about doing it for the 
people and blah blah blah.

## POINTER 4177
Whew, I'm glad I'm part 
of the <STR>(FRE) Brigade.

## POINTER 4178
Thank you for 
healing everyone. <PAGE>But the flowers 
aren't blooming. I 
feel so depressed...

## POINTER 4179
What are we to do?

## POINTER 4180
His Highness Ioder's speech
was a little shocking. <PAGE>But I guess we 
have to go for it, 
sink or swim...

## POINTER 4181
Life without blastia 
might be tough...<PAGE>But we've just got to persevere. 
If the world is destroyed, 
we've lost everything anyway.

## POINTER 4182
I know what's going to happen... 
All of Ilyccia will sink into the 
sea, while that tower remains. <PAGE>Just like the legends 
of ancient continents 
that met the same fate...

## POINTER 4183
I'll be fine even if 
the entire world sinks 
into the sea.<PAGE>All we'd have to do is 
live on boats, right?

## POINTER 4184
I think it would be best to 
remain in the capital and lend 
a hand to its reconstruction. <PAGE>But he wants to 
leave on our trip 
as soon as possible.

## POINTER 4185
It would be hard just 
to leave the lower 
quarter like this...

## POINTER 4186
Things finally settled 
down. I think I can finally 
leave on my trip now. <PAGE>I feel sorry for everyone 
and all, but I've been 
waiting for this trip!

## POINTER 4187
Problems make you 
really appreciate peace 
and quiet. <PAGE>That's why we're heading 
out on our journey! 
For some excitement!

## POINTER 4188
I say, Beanpole and 
Porky are actually helping 
rebuild the city. <PAGE>See? They're nice guys. 
You should really be 
nicer to them, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 4189
I have to clean up my 
shop when I get back 
to the lower quarter. <PAGE>Oh man, this is so bad...

## POINTER 4190
I'll get food ready 
while the men are out 
looking around the city. <PAGE>You can't fight on an 
empty stomach, right?

## POINTER 4191
When everyone's done eating, 
we're all going back to the lower 
quarter and cleaning our city up!

## POINTER 4192
First, the men are going 
into the lower quarter to 
see how things are. <PAGE>I hope it's not too bad.

## POINTER 4193
Next, we'll clean up this city 
and have it ready for you when 
you come home, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 4194
You know Laureis Isle, 
that rocky island to 
the west of Zaphias? <PAGE>I heard that earthquake that 
hit Aspio also flattened a 
mountain there and made a plain.

## POINTER 4195
I bet you could get 
some amazing treasure 
from that mountain. <PAGE>Ahh... 
That's every man's dream!

## POINTER 4196
I heard that the sky over 
the capital is strange. <PAGE>I wonder if something is happening 
with the the capital's barrier blastia.

## POINTER 4197
I think it's not so much a barrier 
abnormality as gathering some kind 
of power... Interesting...

## POINTER 4198
Blastia we excavated 
that weren't working 
are now working again. <PAGE>How strange... 
It's almost like they're 
resonating with something.

## POINTER 4199
Research doesn't go smoothly 
when Mordio's not here.
