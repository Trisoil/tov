## POINTER 4200
Are you researching the 
abnormality with the 
capital's barrier blastia?

## POINTER 4201
Lately, the blastia on the 
hillside has been giving 
abnormal readings...

## POINTER 4202
If you have some time, why 
don't you check on the 
blastia on the hillside.

## POINTER 4203
Hey...you hear this one?<PAGE>They say a tower shot up from the 
mountains on the other continent! 
Can you believe that?

## POINTER 4204
Can you believe that?

## POINTER 4205
It doesn't matter where 
we run anymore...

## POINTER 4206
Even in times like these, 
we can't keep from 
hunting monsters.<PAGE>It's fate, I tell ya.

## POINTER 4207
Monster are evil. Dangerous. 
We must eradicate them 
at all costs.

## POINTER 4208
Hmph, I guess 
we got no choice 
but to cooperate.<PAGE>But I wonder how 
long that'll last.

## POINTER 4209
Well, we'll just 
have to do 
what we can.

## POINTER 4210
The Empire just needs 
to be wiped off the 
face of the world.<PAGE>The people of this town 
will protect their own!

## POINTER 4211
A new age will come when we 
get rid of the Empire and 
change how the world runs!

## POINTER 4212
We should be thankful 
we escaped with our lives.

## POINTER 4213
It must be divine judgment.

## POINTER 4214
I feel like I'm on some 
kind of adventure!

## POINTER 4215
But I'm really, 
really tired...

## POINTER 4216
All my wife does 
is complain. 
I'm tired of it.<PAGE>I wish she'd lay 
off it for a while.

## POINTER 4217
It's not like I'm 
happy either...<PAGE>I read the "Zaphias Rangers" 
serial all the time. I want to 
know what's gonna happen next...

## POINTER 4218
Ugh! 
I'm all dirty. 
It's gross.<PAGE>I'm starving! 
I want some candy! 
It's hot!

## POINTER 4219
I miss the elegant life of 
Zaphias... Well, it wasn't 
really all that elegant!

## POINTER 4220
Thank you very much, 
and come again!

## POINTER 4221
ｑｑｑｑｑ

## POINTER 4222
Welcome. The healing 
waters of Yumanju are 
open night or day.

## POINTER 4223
Welcome to Yumanju's 
gift shop, Bubble Baubles. <PAGE>I'm afraid we don't sell 
any midnight snacks, but go 
ahead and take a look around.

## POINTER 4224
I think I was in the bath for too long. 
I feel a bit flushed.∀

## POINTER 4225
Like your girls fresh 
out of the bath, huh? 
Yeah, I've seen your type before.

## POINTER 4226
There's nothin' finer than 
taking a bath under the nighttime sky! <PAGE>A cool drink, a little moon gazin'... 
It's just the best!!

## POINTER 4227
There's also that first drink after 
ya get out, though. Wouldn't be a 
proper bath without that now, would it?<PAGE>Heh, guess I do my 
fair share of drinkin'.

## POINTER 4228
Hey! All these drinks 
are for grown-ups...

## POINTER 4229
There was a big bang, and 
the water just starting shooting 
out, and the fountain broke! <PAGE>I'm scared, <STR>(YUR)! 
Help us...

## POINTER 4230
Repede!♪ 
I love your big ol' ears!∀

## POINTER 4231
It looks like the weirdness in the 
sky cleared up, but some houses in 
the lower quarter got messed up.<PAGE>The Knights won't do anything 
for us, so I guess we'll take 
care of things ourselves.

## POINTER 4232
The monsters can get in 
with the barrier down...<PAGE>Here in Zaphias, we have the 
Knights to keep them at bay, but 
what are the other towns doing?

## POINTER 4233
Welcome! This shop stays open, 
no matter what. Don't want to 
inconvenience people, you know!

## POINTER 4234
Thanks again! 
Stop by any time, even if 
it's just to say hello.

## POINTER 4235
Hey, long time no see! 
Take your time looking around!

## POINTER 4236
Thanks again! And hey! 
<STR>(YUR)! Don't let <STR>(FRE)
beat you, okay?

## POINTER 4237
If it isn't the wanted man!♪<PAGE>You've got that big bounty 
on your head... Maybe you 
want us to catch you?

## POINTER 4238
It seems like <STR>(FRE)'s 
activities lately have made 
him quite the celebrity.<PAGE>The girls in town 
have even formed a 
"<STR>(FRE) Defense Force"!

## POINTER 4239
The <STR>(FRE) Defense 
Force is really 
just a fan club.<PAGE>It sounded like fun, 
so I joined too!♪

## POINTER 4240
To think the aque blastia 
had just been repaired! 
They must've done a shoddy job. <PAGE>I even used money 
I'd saved for my wedding 
to get it fixed...

## POINTER 4241
That blastia breaking was bad, 
but it brought the people of the 
lower quarter together.<PAGE>Even my girl says 
she's counting on me... 
Heh heh.

## POINTER 4242
Wow, <STR>(FRE)'s amazing! 
You hear he made captain?<PAGE>He's the pride of 
the lower quarter.

## POINTER 4243
What, now the barrier blastia's 
broken? At least the monsters 
haven't invaded yet.<PAGE>We have to protect this 
city. The lower quarter
is my only home.

## POINTER 4244
I wonder what will happen with 
our water. We can't cook, clean, 
or even bathe without it.

## POINTER 4245
What are you going to do 
now? <STR>(FRE)'s doing his 
duty as a Knight, but you...

## POINTER 4246
They say <STR>(FRE)'s doing a great 
job with the Knights. It's all the 
lower quarter can talk about.

## POINTER 4247
You never change, do 
you <STR>(YUR)? Always letting 
<STR>(FRE) take the lead.<PAGE>I hope you'll show us what 
you're really made of one 
of these days, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 4248
You were in the castle, right? 
Did you see <STR>(FRE)?<PAGE>Tell <STR>(FRE) the lower quarter's 
in trouble!

## POINTER 4249
<STR>(YUR)! I saw your 
wanted poster.<PAGE>I can't believe there's 
a bounty on you! You're 
famous in the Empire!

## POINTER 4250
<STR>(FRE)'s a captain now! 
He's amazing!<PAGE>And I know <STR>(FRE)'ll keep 
working for the lower 
quarter, even as a captain.

## POINTER 4251
Great... Just great... 
The lower quarter's a mess.

## POINTER 4252
I wonder if <STR>(FRE) will rebuild 
things if we ask. I mean, 
<STR>(FRE)'s really important now!<PAGE><STR>(YUR), go and ask 
for us!

## POINTER 4253
All the members of the <STR>(FRE)
Defense Force followed 
<STR>(FRE) to his new town.<PAGE>They just don't get it! If they 
really knew <STR>(FRE), they'd stay 
here in the lower quarter.

## POINTER 4254
After the incident with magistrate 
Ragou, the Council's reputation 
has taken a huge hit. <PAGE>Now the balance between the Council and 
the Imperial Knights is wavering... 
What will become of our Empire?

## POINTER 4255
Onions, carrots, and...
Is this crate full of bottles? <PAGE>Lucky I noticed, I was just about 
to kick this thing away and 
shatter them all. That was close!

## POINTER 4256
You should visit 
your old room 
once in a while. <PAGE>If you don't take care of it, 
the dust in there 
will start forming strata!

## POINTER 4257
Halt! 
If you go any further, 
you'll leave the city. <PAGE>The world outside Zaphias' barrier 
is swarming with monsters. It's too 
dangerous for you equipped like that.

## POINTER 4258
An emergency order 
has been issued to 
seal off the capital. <PAGE>None may pass.

## POINTER 4259
Commandant Alexei rode off 
on a monster somewhere. <PAGE>Maybe I should follow him...

## POINTER 4260
If Commandant Alexei truly brought 
this disaster upon us, it is the Knights' duty 
to protect the city with our very lives.

## POINTER 4261
I don't know if our strong defense 
made them give up or what, but monsters 
haven't attacked as much lately. <PAGE>You can rest easy. 
Zaphias is a safe 
place to live.

## POINTER 4262
Wait, wait a moment! 
Has the good sir seen my work yet? 
It burns with a palpable passion!

## POINTER 4263
Your wanted poster. Your wanted 
poster, good sir! It was none other 
than I who painted it! <PAGE>You're a very distinctive young man, 
so I remembered it well. 
It is a masterwork, is it not?

## POINTER 4264
Ahh, the hero returns! Your bounty 
keeps going up and up, and 
I cannot but be filled with joy. <PAGE>Painting your wanted poster 
was quite worthwhile indeed.

## POINTER 4265
Would that you would do even more 
evil and become an arch-villain to 
forever leave his name in history!

## POINTER 4266
The sky is the color of the water 
after I paint. Landscapes aren't my 
specialty, but ohhh, this color...

## POINTER 4267
This time it was a 
phoenix! A phoenix was 
flying over Zaphias! <PAGE>But it was struck 
down by that uncanny 
aurora in the sky!

## POINTER 4268
Not only is Captain <STR>(FRE) kind, 
he's so good-looking!∀ <PAGE>All the girls of 
Zaphias have had their eyes 
on him for a while.

## POINTER 4269
It's been a while now since 
I left the Krityan city and 
came to live in the capital. <PAGE>It's so quiet. 
It's really nice here.

## POINTER 4270
Living comfortably 
helps enrich 
your heart, too. <PAGE>If you've got a stable 
livelihood, doesn't that 
put your mind at ease?

## POINTER 4271
I think it's good that 
the Empire manages 
the blastia.<PAGE>People tend to forget that blastia 
are managed because they're 
such a part of everyday life.

## POINTER 4272
Regulating private possession 
of blastia is a simple and 
effective way to prevent accidents.

## POINTER 4273
I helped hunt monsters 
in the town where 
I used to live. <PAGE>We had seasons when our 
barrier would weaken and 
monsters would get inside.

## POINTER 4274
Here in Zaphias you have the 
Imperial Knights, so I can't 
even help with defense...<PAGE>What else is there 
that I can do?

## POINTER 4275
The knight usually guarding 
the lower quarter is a 
dependable, loyal person. <PAGE>He's in the Schwann Brigade. The 
useless ones are in the Cumore Brigade. 
The commanders make the difference.

## POINTER 4276
I know using bodhi blastia 
causes harmful effects, but we 
can't think about that now.

## POINTER 4277
I met <STR>(FRE) before he 
was a captain, you know. 
He's a really nice guy! <PAGE>When I join the Knights 
I'm gonna be in the <STR>(FRE) Brigade!

## POINTER 4278
Salt, check. Sugar, check. Did
I forget anything...? Ah, such 
a lovely day for shopping.

## POINTER 4279
Oh...are you from the 
lower quarter, young man? <PAGE>Tee-hee...what a handsome 
young figure. I got a bonus 
with my shopping today!♪

## POINTER 4280
Hey, why don't you join the 
<STR>(FRE) Defense Force, too?<PAGE>Hee-hee.  I'm the founder 
of the <STR>(FRE) Defense 
Force, you know.

## POINTER 4281
The barrier's gone! <PAGE>What'll happen if that strange 
monster that showed up in 
the sky attacks Zaphias...?

## POINTER 4282
I pray they fix the 
barrier blastia soon...

## POINTER 4283
They say young <STR>(FRE) built a 
new town in Hypionia.<PAGE>Will you be joining <STR>(FRE)
there, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 4284
The Knights are the sword of justice. 
The shield of the weak. 
We can retreat not a step.

## POINTER 4285
There was a huge 
earthquake to the north!<PAGE>This is it. The end of the world... 
It doesn't matter if a monster eats you 
or the world ends. It's all the same!

## POINTER 4286
I hope when the world 
ends, it happens so fast 
we don't even notice.<PAGE>I don't want 
it to hurt...

## POINTER 4287
I'm gonna go to the new town 
and have Captain <STR>(FRE)
teach me how to use a sword! <PAGE>I'm gonna be a knight just 
like Captain <STR>(FRE)!

## POINTER 4288
Th-th-th-the barrier 
disappeared! <PAGE>Monsters are going to attack! 
 How come we have 
to stay in the city?!

## POINTER 4289
This lull in monster attacks is 
only temporary. <PAGE>It's so obvious they'll be back to 
attack again in a huge swarm!

## POINTER 4290
It's all over, it's all over! 
The capital! My life!
Ohhh... <PAGE>Why did I ever 
become a knight...

## POINTER 4291
Only nobles and royalty are 
fit to be on this level.<PAGE>It's not really a 
place for people from 
the lower quarter.

## POINTER 4292
I can't really say anything, 
though. I was raised in the 
lower quarter, too.<PAGE>Being up here really 
makes me miss the 
warmth of the lower quarter...

## POINTER 4293
The barrier blastia's 
pretty huge, too. So big, it 
kind of numbs your senses.

## POINTER 4294
Nighttime entry 
is not permitted.

## POINTER 4295
There's a suspicious person! 
Arrest him immediately!

## POINTER 4296
This is the heart 
of the Empire. <PAGE>If you want to get in, you 
either have to be an Imperial Knight 
or be caught as a criminal.

## POINTER 4297
Why are you loitering in 
front of the castle at this hour? 
Do you want to get arrested?

## POINTER 4298
This is the hope of the 
Empire, Zaphias Castle. <PAGE>We, the Imperial Knights, have 
guarded the fire of hope through 
wind and rain. Well, sort of.

## POINTER 4299
I'm not impressed 
that you've brought along 
children at this hour. <PAGE>You'll be suspected 
of kidnapping.
