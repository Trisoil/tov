## POINTER 200
If there's ever anything 
I can do to help you, 
please let me know.

## POINTER 201
I think it's good that 
the Empire manages 
the blastia.<PAGE>People tend to forget that 
blastia are managed because they're 
such a part of everyday life.

## POINTER 202
There must be some reason 
for blastia to be managed. <PAGE>I don't know what it is, but...

## POINTER 203
Do you know the saying, 
"To lack nobility is 
to lack humanity"?<PAGE>Ah, but of course you wouldn't. 
You lot have no education, 
after all. Forgive me.

## POINTER 204
The lower caste continues 
to work fussily about today, 
I see. How miserable.

## POINTER 205
They say some commoners 
broke into one of the 
noble mansions. <PAGE>Isn't that just like 
the poor? They lack 
conscience and dignity!

## POINTER 206
The pauper filth should be 
happy to polish our boots. <PAGE>Not that I'd let a wretch 
like you anywhere near 
my boots, of course.

## POINTER 207
Ever busy, ever 
bare, they say. <PAGE>How fitting.

## POINTER 208
You lot can't survive 
without working so hard you 
literally cough up blood, yes?<PAGE>Sorry, but I have so much 
free time I don't even 
know what to do with it.

## POINTER 209
The Empire may appear 
peaceful, but its foundations 
are shaking. <PAGE>We still don't have 
a new emperor.

## POINTER 210
It's already been six months 
since Krunos XIV passed on... <PAGE>There aren't even any hints 
as to who the next emperor 
might be. It is most unusual.

## POINTER 211
Apparently the 
aspirants for emperor 
are quite young. <PAGE>Even if it's too early to ascend 
to the throne, they could at least 
let us know who the successor is.

## POINTER 212
I'm so worried with no 
successor named yet... <PAGE>Who's going to take 
command if there were 
a state of emergency?

## POINTER 213
There are rumors the Council 
and Imperial Knights are clashing 
over the new emperor. <PAGE>It seems they both have 
an aspirant they favor to 
take over the throne.

## POINTER 214
The power balance between the 
Council and the Knights could change 
depending on the next emperor. <PAGE>I just hope whoever ascends 
to the throne truly cares 
for their subjects...

## POINTER 215
The barrier is...whirling around? 
Wait, is that even the barrier? 
I've never seen such a strange sky.

## POINTER 216
Many people have 
left Zaphias.<PAGE>But I've lived in this city 
so long, I'd never be 
able to just abandon it.

## POINTER 217
Dragons and phoenixes were 
flying over Zaphias... 
What were they doing? <PAGE>I was sure they'd come to 
attack us, but it seems 
the barrier blocked them.

## POINTER 218
It looks like the 
barrier has stabilized. 
Thank heavens.

## POINTER 219
What is that in the sky...?

## POINTER 220
Was the problem with 
the barrier an omen that the 
sky would become so strange?

## POINTER 221
Thanks to the efforts of 
the Knights, the capital
won't be attacked by monsters.<PAGE>Everyone who ran away 
acted much too rashly.

## POINTER 222
Putting aside the matter of 
that incident with the Commandant, 
we need the Knights. <PAGE>That state of Zaphias right 
now is proof of that.

## POINTER 223
What's wrong, son? Are you lost? 
Zaphias is a huge city, after all. 
Visitors get lost all the time.<PAGE>The capital is 
divided into 
three areas.

## POINTER 224
This is the citizen quarter. To the 
south is the lower quarter, and up the 
stairs to the west is the royal quarter.<PAGE>The castle is north. You can get 
there from the royal quarter. 
You'll know it by the huge gate.

## POINTER 225
Hey! You're the thief! <PAGE>I saw you getting chased!

## POINTER 226
Th-there's no way you're 
stealing from me! 
I-I don't have anything...

## POINTER 227
Y-you're...the 
wanted man!

## POINTER 228
Eeeyaaaah! 
D-don't kill me! 
You can have all my money...

## POINTER 229
Whoa! 
Hey, you're the kidnapper!
Don't take me!

## POINTER 230
H-how could you be 
i-i-innocent when you 
kidnapped the princess?!

## POINTER 231
As long as we remain in 
Zaphias there's nothing 
to fear from the monsters. <PAGE>We've got our barrier, 
and of course the Knights.

## POINTER 232
Zaphias is the safest 
city in the world.

## POINTER 233
You see 
all the tents 
over there? <PAGE>They're the tents for 
the morning market.

## POINTER 234
There are all 
kinds of vegetables 
and meats for sale. <PAGE>My mommy and daddy 
sell bread there too!

## POINTER 235
This morning I was 
helping Mommy and Daddy. <PAGE>One of the customers 
complimented my pretty smile!

## POINTER 236
Everyone's says I'm 
like the poster girl 
for the market. <PAGE>What's a poster girl?

## POINTER 237
Welcome! 
Yummy fresh-baked 
bread for sale!! <PAGE>Oh, sorry, I was just 
practicing. I don't actually 
have any bread to sell.

## POINTER 238
Mommy and Daddy's 
bread is really tasty. 
Come and try it sometime!

## POINTER 239
I came to Zaphias
hoping I could help 
people, but... <PAGE>Now that I'm here, I don't 
really know what to do.

## POINTER 240
I'm trying to find 
something I can help with. <PAGE>I suppose I'll have to 
meet more people in 
the capital first.

## POINTER 241
Hey you were running around 
with some guys in armor earlier! <PAGE>That looked like fun! 
What kind of game was it?

## POINTER 242
I wanna play that 
chase game too!

## POINTER 243
Hey! You're that 
wanted guy!<PAGE>I would help keep the 
capital safe if I caught 
a wanted man...<PAGE>For now, I need to 
start with meeting more 
people in the capital. <PAGE>Now I know the lower quarter
and the people who live here.

## POINTER 244
You look kind of like 
that guy on the wanted 
posters, but...not... <PAGE>It'd be bad if they were 
really false charges. <PAGE>People talk, you know, 
and it's good information 
a lot of the time. <PAGE>It's a good idea to 
listen to what people 
like me have to say.

## POINTER 245
Zaphias may be a nice place 
to live, but that means its 
taxes are that much higher. <PAGE>Prices went up again recently...

## POINTER 246
I don't have a regular job, 
and getting by from day to day 
is eating up my savings.<PAGE>*Sigh* 
Maybe I should just 
go back to Halure...

## POINTER 247
Something's wrong 
with the barrier...<PAGE>No, wait. Is this...aer?

## POINTER 248
Why would so much aer suddenly 
be flowing through Zaphias?<PAGE>It seems to be coming from 
the castle... Could the source 
be the barrier blastia...?

## POINTER 249
The city's still in chaos, and now 
of all times the knight guarding the 
ramparts has to be that guy...

## POINTER 250
The knight usually guarding 
the lower quarter is a 
dependable, loyal person. <PAGE>He's in the Schwann Brigade. 
The useless ones are in the Cumore Brigade. 
The commanders make the difference.

## POINTER 251
I'm helping the Knights 
fight the monsters. <PAGE>I did the same 
job in Halure, so I'm 
sure I'm some help.

## POINTER 252
I borrowed a bodhi blastia from 
a knight. I know the Council didn't 
approve it, but hey...<PAGE>I know it's against the rules and all, 
but there are way more serious 
things to worry about now.

## POINTER 253
Apparently the Knights 
protecting the capital now 
are all pretty diligent guys. <PAGE>The worthless ones all 
ran away a long time ago.

## POINTER 254
What kind of leadership did 
the Knights have, anyway?<PAGE>With Commandant Alexei and all... 
I don't know what to think of 
the Imperial Knights anymore.

## POINTER 255
The Imperial Knights 
are so cool!<PAGE>I'm gonna be 
a Knight when 
I grow up!

## POINTER 256
I'll defend Zaphias! 
Leave it to me! <PAGE>Don't worry, 
I'll protect 
you too!

## POINTER 257
I am a member of the Imperial 
Knights! Vile criminal! 
You're under arrest!

## POINTER 258
I mean, come on. 
You were just running 
from some Knights...

## POINTER 259
Hey! 
I saw your face 
on a poster! <PAGE>If I brought you to the 
Knights they'd give me a 
lot of Gald, wouldn't they?

## POINTER 260
I'm gonna haul you 
in and have the 
Knights hire me!

## POINTER 261
Did you hear? The Knights 
have a new brigade: 
the <STR>(FRE) Brigade!

## POINTER 262
I met <STR>(FRE) before he 
was a captain, you know. 
He's a really nice guy! <PAGE>When I join the Knights 
I'm gonna be in the 
<STR>(FRE) Brigade!

## POINTER 263
Salt, check. Wine, check. Did 
I forget anything...? Ah, such 
a lovely day for shopping.

## POINTER 264
Oh...are you from the 
lower quarter, young man? <PAGE>Tee-hee...what a handsome young 
figure. I got an unexpected 
bonus with my shopping today!â™ª

## POINTER 265
Is it true the aque blastia 
in the lower quarter
broke? How terrible.

## POINTER 266
If you need water, 
bring some from 
the citizen quarter.<PAGE>In troubled times we all 
have to help each other out.

## POINTER 267
Oh my! You're 
the one the Knights 
were chasing! <PAGE>Do you really think it's 
a good idea to be here?

## POINTER 268
Only nobles and 
royalty should be 
on this level.<PAGE>This isn't a place for 
people from the 
lower quarter like you.

## POINTER 269
But you know, I was 
actually raised in the 
lower quarter, too.<PAGE>Being up here really 
makes me miss the warmth 
of the lower quarter...

## POINTER 270
One of the guards over there 
took a rock to the head 
and got knocked out. <PAGE>How pathetic...

## POINTER 271
You know, this armor is 
actually really thin. <PAGE>I really wish they'd 
supply us with some 
heavier armor.

## POINTER 272
The royal quarter stretches 
all the way past this gate, 
along the outside of the castle.<PAGE>They don't really like ordinary, 
working people over there.

## POINTER 273
Maybe it's the whole thief thing, 
but people stare at you just for 
being from the lower quarter.

## POINTER 274
It's almost overwhelming 
how large the castle is 
when you're this close.

## POINTER 275
Our barrier blastia
"The Sword Stair" is pretty huge too. 
It kind of numbs your senses.

## POINTER 276
Ahead is 
Zaphias Castle.

## POINTER 277
Common citizens are 
not permitted entry.

## POINTER 278
We are currenly under 
heightened security. <PAGE>Withdraw at once or face 
immediate arrest.

## POINTER 279
This is Zaphias Castle, residence of 
his majesty, the Emperor.<PAGE>Not that there is 
a current Emperor...

## POINTER 280
If you keep loitering 
around here I'll be 
forced to arrest you.<PAGE>So go on. Get lost.

## POINTER 281
This is the magnificent 
Zaphias Castle.<PAGE>Security has been increased 
following a certain criminal's 
escape the other day.

## POINTER 282
<STR>(FRE) was appointed 
captain and given his own 
brigade to command.<PAGE>The <STR>(FRE) Brigade is a ranger unit. 
I'd much rather be traveling with 
them than standing here all day.

## POINTER 283
Up ahead is the royal quarter.

## POINTER 284
You may enter freely, 
but refrain from panhandling. <PAGE>Should you try anything so vulgar, 
you will face immediate arrest.

## POINTER 285
Pets are permitted entry, 
but you are required to 
observe proper etiquette. <PAGE>You must clean up any 
mess they might make.

## POINTER 286
You there! Are you 
crazy, walking around 
in your pajamas? <PAGE>I've never seen 
such unfashionable 
nightclothes in my life.

## POINTER 287
Would you mind not 
walking so close to me? <PAGE>I don't want anyone thinking 
I'm with someone who has such 
an acute lack of fashion sense.

## POINTER 288
Hmm, that's an unusual 
dog you have there. 
What's the breed? <PAGE>Not that it's at 
all cute, of course.

## POINTER 289
One should choose their 
pets very carefully. <PAGE>You can tell someone's 
status by what type of 
pet they have, you know.

## POINTER 290
All the people that come to goggle 
at the castle and our stately homes 
lately are quite annoying.<PAGE>...Can't you take a hint? 
I'm talking about you.

## POINTER 291
Stay away. I don't want 
your stench on me.

## POINTER 292
I'm amazed you can walk 
around here so casually without 
realizing you don't belong. <PAGE>Such shameless impudence.

## POINTER 293
Don't talk to me. 
Know your place.

## POINTER 294
Ahh, such a beautiful 
sky...and the castle, so 
mysterious, so exquisite!

## POINTER 295
Ah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah 
hah hah hah hah hah hah hah 
hah hah hah hah hah hah hah!

## POINTER 296
Heh...heh heh... 
I protected all my wealth. <PAGE>I don't care what 
happens as long as 
I have my money.

## POINTER 297
As long as I have money...
Hee hee hee hee hee!

## POINTER 298
I am a member of 
the Imperial Council. <PAGE> There are times when even Krityans 
must be in important positions 
within the government.

## POINTER 299
If the Empire requests 
something, one cannot 
rightly refuse, can one?<PAGE>Personally, I think human 
affairs should be left 
to humans, but...
