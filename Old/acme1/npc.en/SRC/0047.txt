Don't talk to me 
or you'll be crying.

## POINTER 4701
Don't talk to me 
or I'll adopt you.

## POINTER 4702
Don't talk to me 
or I'll make you pay 
for my dinner.

## POINTER 4703
Don't talk to me 
or you'll be living in 
the second dimension.

## POINTER 4704
Don't talk to me
or you'll have a 
delicate situation.

## POINTER 4705
Don't talk to me 
or you'll be covered 
in ash.

## POINTER 4706
Don't talk to me 
or I'll milk you.

## POINTER 4707
Don't talk to me 
or you'll be standing 
under a waterfall.

## POINTER 4708
Don't talk to me 
or you'll be 
eating bread.

## POINTER 4709
Don't talk to me 
or you won't 
be laughing.

## POINTER 4710
First the Knights, now 
the mercenaries?

## POINTER 4711
This is the Union, where 
the guilds come together.

## POINTER 4712
Th-the barrier disappeared?! 
I-I have to inform the Don!

## POINTER 4713
Wha... M-monsters showed up?! 
I-I have to inform the Don!

## POINTER 4714
This is the Union, where 
the guilds come together... 
But the Don is gone...

## POINTER 4715
I-I  never actually fought monsters 
before... They're terrible! M-my 
hands are still shaking...

## POINTER 4716
So there are even feuds 
within the Union...

## POINTER 4717
I'm looking for people 
to join my new guild.

## POINTER 4718
Ever thought about making 
a guild of your own?

## POINTER 4719
What? Monsters again?
What a great opportunity!
Our guild's first job!

## POINTER 4720
If only we were a 
little stronger...the Don
wouldn't have had to die.

## POINTER 4721
What's going to happen to 
the Union without the Don?

## POINTER 4722
I don't care what 
happens to the Empire.

## POINTER 4723
The only thing that matters 
is what happens to us, right?

## POINTER 4724
I'm going to defend this town!

## POINTER 4725
I've never heard of such 
a huge pack of monsters. 
What's going on?

## POINTER 4726
We have to go check out 
the forest ofKeiv Moc... 
It's to the west, if I remember right.

## POINTER 4727
Sooner or later, 
we're going to have 
to fight the Empire.

## POINTER 4728
Barbos always did have 
ambition... It looks like 
he finally made his move.

## POINTER 4729
The city's calmed 
down a little.

## POINTER 4730
At least, compared to 
how crazy it's been.

## POINTER 4731
We can deal with any monster 
as long as we're follwing the 
Don's orders!

## POINTER 4732
Palestralle's a tough enemy.

## POINTER 4733
Nobody wanted things 
to end up like this.

## POINTER 4734
Right now we have to 
concentrate all our efforts 
on preserving the Union.

## POINTER 4735
DonDonDonDonnnnnn

## POINTER 4736
Welcome. Will you 
be staying? 
That will be 100 Gald.

## POINTER 4737
呼宿出休みますか？

## POINTER 4738
Mr. Barbos
is the owner of
a rival tavern.

## POINTER 4739
If I were to guess, 
I'd say it was about 
1,000 years old...<PAGE>You'd know it 
if you saw it.

## POINTER 4740
A cold drink in the 
afternoon is the best!

## POINTER 4741
What?!
The barrier was fixed?

## POINTER 4742
The barrier disappeared.
How should I respond
to this situation?

## POINTER 4743
There's no way 
the monsters could 
bring it down...

## POINTER 4744
They say someone tampered
with the barrier blastia.

## POINTER 4745
We'll have to put the 
barrier blastia under much heavier 
guard from now on.

## POINTER 4746
Even our mighty barrier won't 
protect us against the Knights.

## POINTER 4747
If only we had a barrier
that worked against people.

## POINTER 4748
I bet the barrier failure 
was Barbos's doing, too.

## POINTER 4749
The barrier is stable for another day.
As long as we have the barrier,
the town is at peace.

## POINTER 4750
The barrier is a symbol
of this town's peace.

## POINTER 4751
The monsters
penetrated the barrier so easily.
Are we even safe?

## POINTER 4752
The barrier failure, the monsters 
attacking... So much for the 
fairytale about barrier safety.<PAGE>Sure, we're safer with it,  
but it's no guarantee.

## POINTER 4753
Barriers protect us from monsters, 
but they can't protect us from 
the evil of other humans.<PAGE>The Don
protected us
from that.

## POINTER 4754
The barrier in Zaphias
is acting up.<PAGE>If you put all your trust in the barrier,
it could hurt you in the end.

## POINTER 4755
The time may have come
where we need to find a way
to live without the barrier.

## POINTER 4756
The Knights helped 
us repair our bridge.

## POINTER 4757
I guess there are some 
decent Knights, after all.

## POINTER 4758
Yet again, I failed 
to seize the opportunity 
to show my true strength.

## POINTER 4759
Really... 
What's going to happen...?

## POINTER 4760
Welcome to Nam Cobanda 
Isle, a veritable wonderland 
of attractions.∀<PAGE>You won't be able to enter 
without a ticket though, 
not even after dark.

## POINTER 4761
Once inside, you'll need 
chips to enjoy all 
the fun and games.<PAGE>You can go ahead and purchase those 
very chips at the gymnasium.∀

## POINTER 4762
Congratulations! 
You have found 
the gymnasium!<PAGE>There's no shortage of things to see and 
do! Revel in sights and sounds only to be 
experienced in the heat of the night!

## POINTER 4763
There truly are a million 
different ways to while 
away your time here!<PAGE>Maybe even something 
perfectly suited to 
your very own tastes!

## POINTER 4764
In treasure fishing, you tug 
on a string in hopes of 
winning fabulous prizes.<PAGE>There's no telling 
what you might win!

## POINTER 4765
There might even be a few 
things you wouldn't exactly 
call "treasure," per se.<PAGE>But hey, that's 
part of the thrill, 
right?

## POINTER 4766
Man, isn't okonomiyaki 
delicious?<PAGE>Unfortunately, we don't have 
any rice to go with it.

## POINTER 4767
A bit of this, and a bit of that, cook 
it up quick and lickity-splat.♪<PAGE>Next we'll add some syrupy sauce, 
then serve it up sizzling and 
piping hot. Simply delicious!∀

## POINTER 4768
Save a fish and 
gain a pet!∀<PAGE>I'll let you keep 
whatever you catch!

## POINTER 4769
You save the poor fishies from the mean 
old tank, so it's "Save-a-Fish!"<PAGE>Whaddya think? Pretty 
good, huh?

## POINTER 4770
To your right you'll find 
the hall of masks.<PAGE>See any masks that 
catch your fancy?

## POINTER 4771
On your left you'll 
find the ring toss.<PAGE>Toss a ring and win a prize! 
Close calls don't win 
anything, though.

## POINTER 4772
Target practice here, time for target 
practice! Knock off an item by shooting 
it with cork bullets and it's yours!<PAGE>No points for just 
tipping them 
over, though.

## POINTER 4773
Use the cork bullets lying 
on the ground, and you'll 
have to pay a fine.<PAGE>Don't think I'm not looking, 
either. Cheaters never 
win, you know.

## POINTER 4774
Wow wow yo-yo 
grabber:<PAGE>Temporarily 
closed

## POINTER 4775
Fish hooks 
sold out.<PAGE>More coming 
soon!

## POINTER 4776
Welcome one and all to 
Ant Lion's yakisoba.<PAGE>We're still getting ready 
at this point, though.

## POINTER 4777
I'm missing that certain something 
to give my recipe that final zing.<PAGE>Gonna have to go shopping again soon...

## POINTER 4778
Welcome one and all to 
Ant Lion's burgers.<PAGE>We're still getting ready 
at this point, though.

## POINTER 4779
Now that night has fallen, 
do take care not to overeat 
or wear yourself out. <PAGE>Come right to me if you 
feel out of sorts and I'll 
have a look at you.

## POINTER 4780
Now that it's gotten dark, it's not 
as easy to see where you're going.<PAGE>My office gets pretty 
lonely this late at night, 
let me tell you...

## POINTER 4781
This place just comes alive 
once the sun sets.<PAGE>Everything twinkles in 
the glow of the lights, 
it's just so much fun.

## POINTER 4782
Here, there, I wish I could 
be everywhere at once.∀

## POINTER 4783
Well, how 
do I look?<PAGE>I had it custom-made 
especially for today!

## POINTER 4784
What are the Kowz and 
Ant Lion, anyway...? <PAGE>They're so different 
from Krityans.

## POINTER 4785
They're about my height. 
I wonder if they're 
just kids like us.<PAGE>I hope I'll be able to make friends with 
them now that I've got the chance.

## POINTER 4786
I wonder what the deal 
is with these Kowz 
and Ant Lion Men?<PAGE>They're nothing like we Krityans, 
that's for sure.

## POINTER 4787
It seems pretty unbelievable that 
you'd find all these buildings 
on a solitary island like this.<PAGE>The place has a nice vibe to it, and you've 
gotta appreciate the sleek design.

## POINTER 4788
The best time to be on this 
island is just when the sun's 
sinking below the horizon.

## POINTER 4789
I'm dressed as a Bug Girl. Looks 
pretty good, don't you think?<PAGE>You wouldn't believe how long 
this took me to make.

## POINTER 4790
Yep, I can tell. That outfit 
you're wearing is a 
costume too, right?<PAGE>I wouldn't mind trying 
that on myself.∀

## POINTER 4791
That's a statue of something 
called a rappig.<PAGE>It was made to celebrate 
the 100th anniversary 
of something.

## POINTER 4792
I heard there's a time capsule 
in there with all sorts of items 
and memories locked inside.<PAGE>They're gonna open it up on 
the 200th anniversary. That 
should be fun, I think.

## POINTER 4793
This is the chip 
exchange.<PAGE>You can trade in your Gald or 
your grades for chips here.

## POINTER 4794
<mini>PKEI'm afraid we can't turn 
chips back into Gald 
or grades, though.<PAGE>Please consider that 
before exchanging.

## POINTER 4795
Go on and have
a good time.

## POINTER 4796
I'm afraid we can't turn
