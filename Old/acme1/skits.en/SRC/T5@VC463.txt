Ice Drifts

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Is it me, or is the ground 
around here changing?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
It's because they're ice drifts. 
They move on the water and change 
how the ground looks.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Wait, so if we don't get out 
of here soon, the path could 
shift and leave us stranded?

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
It's certainly possible.

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Yeah, but then we could use the block 
of ice ta float merrily across the sea!

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Yeah, you do that, old man.

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
I'm not kiddin'! Stick 
with me! It'll be fun!

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
I'm not cut out for fun.

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
Oh, all right. I don't wanna be stuck 
on top of a block of ice with 
a spoilsport, anyway! Let's go.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Yeah, yeah.
