Items? Who Needs Items?

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
H-hey, hold on a sec!

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
What is it? Is something the matter?

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Help me organize these 
items, would you?

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
Since when did we have 
so many of those?

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
We haven't been using 
them. They add up.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
If we can get by without using them, 
so much the better, right?

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Is that how it works...?

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
You don't want to get into the 
habit of wasting items when 
you don't need to, right?

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
Ummm... I'm simply not very 
familiar with using items...

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
Well, it doesn't matter what 
you pick, just use some items... 
They're going to waste!

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
H-he's right, (YUR). 
Let's use our items.

## POINTER 12
(YUR)
All right, if we need to.

## POINTER 13
(KAR)
Or at least help me sort them out!
