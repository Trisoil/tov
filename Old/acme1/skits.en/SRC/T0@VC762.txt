The Dragon Freak

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
The next time I see that freak, 
my magic will be ready!
No mercy!

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
What's she so mad about?

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
It looks like she's upset that we 
let that dragon rider escape.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
I never thought he'd go as far as the Caer 
Bocram underground to destroy blastia.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Now that's dedication.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
The next time we meet, I'll choke the life out of him with my bare hands!

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
(RIT)'s pretty dedicated, herself...
