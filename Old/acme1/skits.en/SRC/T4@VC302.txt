## POINTER 2

I'm not used to soup being cold, 
but this is really delicious.

## POINTER 3

It's not potato soup. It's 
called vichyssoise.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
(EST_P), what would you call 
a soup made from onions?

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
That would be onion soup, but...

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Then this is potato soup!

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
No, it's vichyssoise! It's 
the name of the dish!

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Hey, (RIT). What would

Why won't any of you call 
it vichyssoise...?
