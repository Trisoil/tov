Phaeroh

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
(JUD), you're familiar with Phaeroh, aren't you?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Is he really as scary as he seems?

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Well, let's see. Sometimes he's logical, 
sometimes he's emotional.

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
He can be really scary, or really kind.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
All right, that didn't help very much.

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
One thing's certain. His power is extraordinary, 
even among the Entelexeia.

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
Here's hopin' we don't wind up lookin' like 
poor old Mt. Temza the moment we meet him.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
If he can do that to a mountain, there wouldn't 
be anything left if he turned on us.

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
I wish you wouldn't joke about scary things like that.

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
Why should we get scared before we even get 
there? Especially if he's that strong.

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
Wish I could take it as lightly 
as you and (YUR)...
