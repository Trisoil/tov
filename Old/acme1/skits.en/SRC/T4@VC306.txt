(RIT), you're eating quietly for 
once. Do you like the food?

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
I wouldn't say I like it...but 
I don't dislike it.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
I'm glad it suits your taste, (RIT).

## POINTER 4

I've heard that making pork stew 
is especially time-intensive.

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
Yes, it takes at least two days to boil 
the pork until it's soft enough to eat.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
It seems you're pretty good at 
cooking elaborate dishes, (JUD_P).

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
I used to cook a lot. I don't mind a 
little work if people will enjoy it.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Did you use to cook for your family?

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
Yes. And now I have you all! It makes 
all of the hard work worthwhile.

## POINTER 10

...It's delicious.

## POINTER 11

No.
