"It"

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
Hey, what's with making 
me do all the cooking?!

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
Ah, perhaps you've gotten better and 
ya finally came to enjoy cookin'?

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
No way! Cooking is a pain, and 
it's a waste of time, too!

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
The point of eating is to restore 
your energy, right? Just eat some 
bread or a banana or something!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
What, you want us to just 
eat the ingredients raw?

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
I remember (RIT) serving a sandwich 
that was just two pieces of bread 
with a raw egg in between...

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
A raw egg? How original!

## POINTER 8
(RAV)
Hey, don't get any ideas, now!

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
Make me cook again...and I'll 
put "it" in the food.

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
Put what in the food?

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
Something I've been saving 
for a special occasion.

## POINTER 12
(JUD)
Ooh, that sounds interesting.

## POINTER 13
(KAR)
(JUD), don't encourage her!

## POINTER 14
(RIT)
Don't you dare make me cook next time!

## POINTER 15
(EST_P)
Aww, and I wanted to try what (RIT) was 
saving for a special occasion...

## POINTER 16
(KAR)
(EST_P), I don't think you do...
