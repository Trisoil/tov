## POINTER 1

Grrr. If he was safe, the least 
he coulda done is let us know!

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
That idiot!

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Yeah, if we'd known he was okay, we wouldn't 
have wasted all this time looking for him.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
But we wouldn't have known he was 
all right if we hadn't looked.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Which is why he shoulda let us know in the 
first place! I mean, we looked all over!

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
We'd be too worried about him if we hadn't.

## POINTER 7

You were really worried, weren't you, (RIT)?

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Wha...

## POINTER 9

It's good he made it back safe and sound.

## POINTER 10

look how happy (RIT) is.

## POINTER 11
