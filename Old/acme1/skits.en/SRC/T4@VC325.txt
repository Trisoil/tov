(JUD), we're always making you do the 
cooking for us... You don't mind?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Would you like us to help 
out every now and then?

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
No, that's okay. Cooking's fun. 
Of course, we can switch if 
you don't like my cooking...

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
No, we love your cooking! I 
could never get tired of it!

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Indeed. It brings back memories 
of long ago... It's the sorta 
cookin' I could eat every day.

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
Heh heh, that makes me so happy! 
That's the sort of cooking 
I've been trying for.

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
It be nice if someday you thought 
to yourself, "Gee, I sure would 
like some of (JUD)'s cooking."

## POINTER 8

Yeah, I wouldn't mind 
having this again.

## POINTER 9

...Careful, boys. Just in case you haven't 
caught on, she's taming you.

## POINTER 10
(KAR)

## POINTER 11

Oh my, looks like I've been found out.

## POINTER 12
(RAV)
Heh, heh... Bein' tamed, huh?

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
I'm not sure I can resist...
