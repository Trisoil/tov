The Hunting Blades

## POINTER 1
(JUD)
So his family was killed by the Entelexeia...

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Clint was it? The grudge he's got against 
them won't fade anytime soon.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Maybe he has his reasons, but I 
think just hunting monsters has 
been his purpose for a while.

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
I was like him once... I only 
lived to destroy blastia.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Then maybe he can still change. 
Like you did, (JUD).

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
I don't know... Either 
way, we've got our own 
goals to worry about.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Right, (KAR)?

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
Huh...? ...Yeah, 
you're right!
