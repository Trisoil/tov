What's the Don Like?

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
What about the person who controls the 
Union? What is Don Whitehorse like?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
In a word, big. Big voice, 
big body, big everything!

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
We already know what he looks and 
sounds like. We saw him, remember?

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
Oh yeah, that's right. Well...
He's a really cool person!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Does that answer your question, (EST_P)?

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
It's clear that (KAR) has a 
lot of respect for the Don...

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
But that's about the only thing that's clear...

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
He's so cool that it can't 
be expressed in words!

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
We'll just leave it at that, then.
