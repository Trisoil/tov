Why Was (FRE) Here?

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Come to think of it, why was 
(FRE) in Dahngrest?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
The empire and the Union have never gotten 
along, so Knights don't show up here often.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
I doubt they're here to see the sights, either. 
It's gotta be tied up in one of their duties.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
Do you think (FRE)'s all right?
Those guild people were 
being really mean to him.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
(FRE)'s no delicate little flower.
He can take some heat.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Don't forget. Before he was a knight, he had to 
make it on the streets of the lower quarter.

I hope you're right...
