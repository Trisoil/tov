Reviving the Tree

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
Wow, I've never seen this many flowers 
on Halure's tree before.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Huh? Doesn't it always get like that 
when the flowers are in season?

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
In season or out, I've never seen all 
the buds blooming at once like this.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Really? Guess we're lucky to get 
to see something so amazing.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
I'd say it's more abnormal 
than amazing...
