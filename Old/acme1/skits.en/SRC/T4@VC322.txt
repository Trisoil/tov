Today, Yesterday, The Day Before That...

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Food's ready, everybody!

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Umm, (KAR)... Isn't this the same 
thing you made yesterday?

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Not just yesterday, but the day before, 
and the day before that, too!

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Ya must like this a lot ta be 
makin' it all the time, huh?

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
That's right! I like this so much 
I could eat it every day!

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
Ol' (RAV) prefers a more 
refined, mature taste.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Since I'm always cooking, I figured it was 
my right to make what I like to eat.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Well, that's a good point.

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
Hold on! You're seriously okay with eating 
the same thing every day forever?

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
I'm happy just to have something 
to eat. (KAR)'s cooking 
isn't half bad, either.

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
Thanks, (YUR)! I can't wait to make 
delicious food tomorrow, too!

## POINTER 12
(RAV)
So tomorrow'll be the 
same as today, then?

## POINTER 13
(JUD)
It looks that way. Too bad...

## POINTER 14
(EST_P)
I'm worried that this will 
be bad for our nutrition.

## POINTER 15
(RIT)
Don't bother making any of the same 
stuff for me! I'd rather go hungry.

## POINTER 16
(KAR)
You know, you could all just do some 
cooking yourselves for once...
