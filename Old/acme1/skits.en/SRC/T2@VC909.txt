The Adephagos Revived

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
Ooooh! I'm gonna hurt that idiot 
who brought the Adephagos back!

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
What could have happened at Zaude...

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
Those nut jobs probably fiddled with 
the thing too much, and broke it.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Thanks to Alexei, Zaude's no longer 
functioning like it was meant to!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
This guy just never learns, does he?

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Things are gonna have to hit bottom before 
he'd consider changing his ways.

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
But they see that thing about to eat 
the planet, right? Even an idiot 
would understand the situation.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
...I sure 
hope so...
