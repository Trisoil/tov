Ehmead Hill Blocked

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
If Ehmead Hill is blocked off, none of the people 
stuck in the capital will be able to escape.

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
Yeah, you're right. It's not like they can fly.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
If the aer in the skies above the capital keeps 
increasing, all living things will be in danger.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
And if we let that happen, we won't be 
able to go near the capital ourselves.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
All the more reason to stop 
talking and start moving.
