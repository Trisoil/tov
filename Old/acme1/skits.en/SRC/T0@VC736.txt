Clearing (RIT)'s Name

It's a good thing the core thief 
you're chasing turned out not 
to be (RIT), right (YUR)?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Huh? How do you figure that?
I couldn't care less who the 
core thief was.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
I would have loved if it were 
(RIT). I'd be done by now.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
I wouldn't let her hear you say that...

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Well, at least we got a lead for 
catching the real criminal.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
I can't complain about that.
