## POINTER 1
(BAU)
......

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
Hmm...

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Hey (JUD), what are you doing?

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
I was communicating with Ba'ul.

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Come ta think of it, it's been a while 
since we flew on him, hasn't it?

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
Isn't he lonely while 
you're gone, (JUD)?

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
No, not at all.

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
I can communicate with Ba'ul 
whenever I want to.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Oh yeah? What's Ba'ul doing right now?

## POINTER 10
(JUD)
It appears he's taking a stroll 
in the sky, and eating.

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
Eating...?!

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
How is he eating while 
flying through the sky?

## POINTER 13
(RAV)
He could just leave his mouth open as 
he flew. Food would just come on in.

## POINTER 14
(KAR)
Whoa!!!

## POINTER 15
(KAR)
You mean Ba'ul's a carnivore?

## POINTER 16
(JUD)
Hee hee.

## POINTER 17
(JUD)
If you're so curious, maybe you 
should just ask him yourself.

## POINTER 18
(RIT)
You know we can't talk to Ba'ul 
like you can, right...?
