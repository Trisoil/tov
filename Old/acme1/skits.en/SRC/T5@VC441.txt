Can We Finally Meet (FRE)?

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
I hope we'll finally be able to meet 
(FRE) when we get to Nor Harbor.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
I get the feeling we'll 
miss him again...

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
He could be passing by the foot 
of the hill right now, headed 
back to the capital...

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
But (FRE) left us a letter! 
I'm sure he's waiting for us!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
We'll see...

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Why do we have to take such a convoluted 
path through this place, anyway?

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
It's your fault!

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
H-how was I supposed to help that...?!

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
Quit blaming other people and let's 
get moving! Otherwise we'll 
end up missing him for sure!

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
R-right. Let's hurry to Nor Harbor.
