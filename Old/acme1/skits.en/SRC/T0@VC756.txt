Hey (KAR), do you know anything else about that 
city you said was destroyed in an earthquake?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Just rumors. Supposedly, it was some guild's 
headquarters about ten years ago.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
Which guild was that?

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
Sorry, I can't help you there.

## POINTER 5

I've never heard of an earthquake 
that destroyed an entire city.

Well, Aspio is across the ocean... Maybe the 
information just never made it that far?

Hmm, I wonder...
