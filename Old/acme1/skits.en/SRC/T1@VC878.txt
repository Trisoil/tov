Zagi

## POINTER 1
(JUD)
It's not my place to comment 
on your friendships, but...

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
What is it, (JUD_P)?

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
I think it'd be a good idea if you cut 
your ties with this Zagi character.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
I've been hacking away at them since we first met, believe me!

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Where'd you run into such a...unique 
individual? He seems ta 
be a pretty stubborn fan.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
In the castle, right before 
I left the capital behind.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
(FRE) was supposedly his original 
target, but before I knew it 
he got sort of fixated on me.

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
It can't be easy having such a crazy admirer.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Tell me about it. That's the kind 
of love I can do without.
