It Kinda Works on You

I'm impressed that you passed for a real 
knight, (KAR), despite your height.

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
It's amazing. Especially considering he 
wasn't wearing the full suit of armor.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
That knight must've been so panicked that 
he didn't see anything besides your helmet.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
People usually notice things like that though, right?

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Then why'd you put me up to 
this in the first place?!
