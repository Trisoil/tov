## POINTER 0
The Box

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
It looks like the case holding the clear 
ciel crystal just won't open...

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
I wish we could make sure it's actually in there, 
considering the sort of place we found it in.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Couldn't you just bust it open with your magic?

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
No, I can't.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Right. If we damaged the contents we wouldn't 
be able to make the delivery.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
No, I mean I already tried blowing it up. 
This little box is tougher than it looks.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
...I...I'm at a loss for words.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
Forget it, (EST_P). There's 
not much you can say to that.

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
A-anyway, I suppose it makes sense to put something 
so important in an unbreakable box.
