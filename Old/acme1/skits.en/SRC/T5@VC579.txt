A Sad End

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Why did things have to end 
up the way they did...?

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
At this point, there's no use 
mullin' over whether we chose 
the right course or not.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
But we need to think about it, so the 
same thing doesn't happen again.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
It's becoming harder and harder to make 
a legitimate living in this world.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
I'm not saying that should 
excuse what I've done.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
You can't go through your entire 
life doing what's right. It's 
sad, but that's reality..

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
But that doesn't mean someone who 
used their sword for justice will 
just turn evil for no reason.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
As long as they were fighting to 
protect someone right and good...

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
But accept that, and things 
break down ta anarchy.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
I want to change the world so those 
who are just can lead good lives.

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
A world where we can't have justice 
without making someone else the 
bad guy is just too sad...

## POINTER 12
(KAR)
It'd be nice if people could 
just talk things over.

## POINTER 13
(RAV)
Yeah, that'd be a nice start.

## POINTER 14
(YUR)
......

## POINTER 15
(RIT)
That's why I'm saying that you shouldn't 
carry this burden by yourself!
