Not as Bad as I Thought

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
The area outside the barrier isn't quite 
as bad as I thought it would be.

## POINTER 2
(RAP)
*Woof*

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
But it's like I read... Outside 
the barrier, there are monsters 
everywhere. It's so dangerous!

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Oh yeah?

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Think about all the knights 
going to all the cities of 
the world! This is nothing.

## POINTER 6
(RAP)
*Woof, woof*

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
But a lot of people hardly ever go 
out of the city, like you, (YUR).

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
And some people never even 
go out of the castle...
