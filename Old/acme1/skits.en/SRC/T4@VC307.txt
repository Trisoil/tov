A True Gourmand

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
Hey, there's something seriously messed 
up about people eating dog food.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
It's all the same mush once 
it hits your stomach, right?

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Dog food and people food 
are totally different!

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
You're just afraid you'll 
start liking it.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
But don't you think the taste is addictive? 
I love the unusual flavor!

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
An acquired taste for 
the true gourmand.

## POINTER 7
(RAP)
*Woof!*

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
Maybe that's one taste I don't 
really need to acquire...
