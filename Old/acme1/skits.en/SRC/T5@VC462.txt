## POINTER 1
(RAV)
Ooooh... In this cold, we're 
gonna freeze in no time!

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
In that case, we should move 
more to get warmer. Either that 
or get to a warmer place.

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
Either way, if we hold 
still, we're done for!

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Yeah, but if we wander around 
too much, we could use up all 
our energy and collapse.

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Then it sounds like we need to do what 
we came to do and get outta here.

## POINTER 6
(RAP)
*WOOF!*

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
The pooch seems just fine 
in all this cold...
