Talking in Your Sleep

## POINTER 1
(JUD)
(RIT), last night you were saying the 
strangest things in your sleep...

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
What was it? C'mon, tell me!

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
H-hey, don't go telling 
weird stories about me...

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
You were chanting magic spells.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
...So what? That's not 
scandalous or anything!

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Shut up! What were you expecting, anyway?!

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
(RIT), I think all this fighting we've 
been doing is getting to you.

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
(RIT), you were so cute, saying 
spells in your sleep.

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
Wh-what are you talking about?

## POINTER 10
(JUD)
But I have to say, I was pretty surprised 
when the spell actually worked.

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
S-seriously?

## POINTER 12
(JUD)
You see? (RIT), you should really 
get a little more rest.

## POINTER 13
(RIT)
...How much of that was true, and 
how much of it was a total lie?

## POINTER 14
(JUD)
Oh I've never been very good at lies.
