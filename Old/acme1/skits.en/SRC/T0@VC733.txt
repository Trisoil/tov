## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
These ruins feel very different once you're inside them.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Yeah, it's weird. And there's all this 
stuff I've never seen before...

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
What, is this your first time too, (KAR)?

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
Well, yeah. My specialty's 
monster hunting.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Hey, what do you think this is?

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
You really shouldn't be fooling around over 
there. This place is loaded with traps.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Did anyone else just hear a click?

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
(KAR)! Watch out!

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Waaaaah!

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Sorry, I thought you were about 
to get killed. I overdid it.

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
I think I would have been better 
off getting caught in the trap...
