The Magistrate's Evil

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
A city where the magistrate can do whatever he 
wants really leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Looks like there's bound to be a few power-mad 
imperials no matter where you go.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
What we saw on the way into town here--that happened 
all the time back in the lower quarter.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
I'm glad I live outside the empire. I don't 
think I could stand this very long...

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Why would the magistrate do these things...?

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Hey, we don't need to let the bad 
vibes in this city rub off on us.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
Exactly.

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
All right...
