I Want a Shower

## POINTER 1
(JUD)
Oh, what to do...

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
...What do you mean?

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
I'll die if I can't take a shower 
once a day... And in a dry 
old desert like this...

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
R-really?! (RIT), you 
have to do something!

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Humph. Idiot... She'll be fine.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
It's not like she's a flower.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
Going without a shower won't kill 
you. It's been 10 days since 
I last showered, actually.

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
It's been that long...? I'd be 
on my deathbed if I were you...

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
I've got it! (RIT)'s not a flower! 
She's a prickly cactus!

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
...Die!

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
Gaaah!
