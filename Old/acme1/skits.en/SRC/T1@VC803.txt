Starting a Guild

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
(YUR), I was a little surprised to 
hear that you're starting a guild.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Well, it's not like I'll be doing it all on my own.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Did (KAR) give you the idea?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Yeah, but I'd been thinking about it myself for a while now, too.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
I quit the Knights to find my own way of 
doing things, but I hadn't done anything.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
What (FRE) said to you back in the port 
town... That got to you, didn't it?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Nothing that guy says could get to me.

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
He doesn't like to admit his feelings, does he?

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
No.
