Don, Don't Get Hasty

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
If the Don really did go meet with Yeager, 
what could the reason have been?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
And why would he go alone?

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
It's not to deepen the ties of their friendship, that's for sure.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
It was probably because he didn't want his 
subordinates to get wrapped up in the mess.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Well, that's just one more example of how much 
the guilds love doing things the hard way.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Upholding every rule. Settling every score. 
Is it all really that important?

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
Hey, if we're goin' after the Don, now's the 
time. We can have special sharin' time later.
