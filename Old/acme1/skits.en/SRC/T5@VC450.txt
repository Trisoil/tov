been nervous for a while now.

## POINTER 2

Come on, we'll lose Regaey 
if we don't hurry up!

## POINTER 3

B-but, there might be dangerous 
monsters in there...

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
What are you talking about?! We can't 
just take this sitting down!

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
We can't let him have that box, (KAR)!

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
I'm just a little, tiny, eensy-weensy 
bit curious as ta why he took 
that box. So let's find out!

## POINTER 7
(RAP)
*Woof!*

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
I don't know if you all 
are brave or crazy...

## POINTER 9

I guess I'm outvoted...?

## POINTER 10

Argh, I've had enough of this! 
I'll blast away Regaey AND 
the monsters! Let's go!
