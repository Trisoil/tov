What (RAV)'s Good For

## POINTER 1
(RAV)
So, what possessed you to 
bring old (RAV) along?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Huh? I just figured you'd 
come in handy, I guess.

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
Y'know, you just ain't too bright. It's the perfect 
chance for some alone time with the ladies!

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
What's the fun in havin' two guys here?!

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Aaah! I'm scaaared! Help!

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
Never fear, kitten, daddy's right here.

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
That's the way these things 
are supposed to go down.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
If we run into any trouble, I'm using 
you to save my own skin, got it?

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
Huh? So that's how I come in handy? A decoy?
