Was that fancy ring a 
present from someone?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Hmm, I guess you could 
call it a present.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Well, well, looks like you're 
quite the ladies' man!

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
No no no. I'm just a big sucker.

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
Oh? It's amazing enough the ring 
holds power, but it even reacts 
to aer and becomes stronger!

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
You must have a very strong bond with 
the girl who gave that to you.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
That's one bond I wouldn't 
mind breaking...
