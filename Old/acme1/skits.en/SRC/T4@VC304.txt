An Improved Recipe

## POINTER 1
(RAV)
Oh ho, (RIT)! I hear yer finally 
a stir-fried veggie master?

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
I guess so. Nothing's 
impossible for me.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
You sure you didn't just 
have a good teacher?

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
It always has to be about you, doesn't 
it? This was all my genius.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
But stir-fry is a pain to eat. It ties 
up both my hands so I can't read!

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
(EST_P)'ll get mad at you if she catches 
you reading while you're eating.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
I got it! Put the vegetables 
between slices of bread like 
a sandwich. One hand! Genius!

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
Why do you want to go mess up 
perfectly good food like that?!

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
A stir-fried veggie sandwich... 
What an original concept!

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
...It looks like (JUD)'s ready 
ta add that to her cookbook.

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
Man, (RIT)'s always gotta 
screw things up...

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
You're just jealous!
