Crude Aesthetics

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
Hey, does this place look 
half-finished to you?

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
Not really. Why do ya say that?

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Look at it! There are still boards 
lying all over the place!

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Huh? But that's the ideal! 
Don't you get it?

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
No, I don't.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
This is the essence of simplicity! 
Bare walls and pipes stickin' 
out every which way...

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
I have a feeling the "essence of simplicity" 
is something a little different...

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
In other words, it's good enough 
so long as it works, right?

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
Once again, our genius mage shows 
her lack of appreciation fer 
beauty and fine subtleties!

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
I mean, look, really look, at this 
rusty wire mesh! Isn't it nice?

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
I'm going to go crazy if I have 
to listen to any more of the old 
man's lessons in aesthetics...

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
Can't we just ignore 
him and keep moving?
