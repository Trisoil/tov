What's Going on Here?

## POINTER 1

The barrier failed right as the monsters appeared? 
What the hell is going on in this city?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
I've lived in Dahngrest my whole life, 
but I've never seen anything like this.

## POINTER 3

such terrible timing?!

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
How should I know?

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
What? You don't really 
think I'm cursed, do you?
