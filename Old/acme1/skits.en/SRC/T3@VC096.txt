Exquisite Battles

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
This is amazing! We've been through 
so many battles without a scratch!

## POINTER 2

Yeah! We are soooo tough!

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
Yes, it's not fun at all to get hurt, 
even if we can heal wounds.

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
Though I have to say, it's unusually 
exhilarating to see enemies in pain.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
You're...scary...

## POINTER 6
(RAP)
*Woof!*

## POINTER 7

Battle scars are the true mark 
of a man. What's the point of 
a battle if you don't get hurt?

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
Oh? You like getting hurt?

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
That's not what I'm saying...

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
I don't get you at all.

## POINTER 11
(RAV)

dolin' out pain more than

## POINTER 12

## POINTER 13
(RAV)
