Days Just Fly By...

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Wow, the days just fly by...

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
What's with you all of a sudden?

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
Oh, I've just been thinking 
about how strong we've grown, 
without even realizing it.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
That's because we have terrible luck!

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
What does getting stronger have 
to do with having bad luck?

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
We keep running into one mess 
after another. The empire, the 
guilds...everybody hates us!

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
So all this bad luck made us fight, 
and so...we got stronger.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
...Is that really luck?

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
It's all right, (KAR).

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
As we travel, the winds of luck are little 
by little turning in our favor.

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
Exactly. Luck just flies 
by, too...like the wind!

## POINTER 12
(KAR)
(YUR), you're...kind of 
missing the point...
