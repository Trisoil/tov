A Nice, Fun, Relaxing Trip

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
Red-eyes, knights... Why can't we just 
have a nice, fun, relaxing trip?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
You're one to complain, (YUR).

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Yeah, weren't those knights calling YOUR name?

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
But you're the one who was fighting 
with the mages, (RIT).

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Please, everyone! We're okay, aren't 
we? I actually think it's kind of fun.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
If you think being chased is fun, you're 
going to love the rest of this trip.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Yeah, you may have written off what just 
happened, but we're still fugitives!
