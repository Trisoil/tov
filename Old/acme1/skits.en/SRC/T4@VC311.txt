(RIT)'s 3-Second Cooking

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Oooh, I'm following the recipes... 
Why isn't my food coming out 
as good as yours, (JUD)?

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
I do all of my seasoning by 
taste. Maybe that's it.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Try changing the balance of ingredients, 
or adding some seasoning 
that's not in the recipe.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
Good idea. I'll try that.

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
(RIT), I never expected to hear such 
practical advice coming from you!

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
H-hey! I'm not the best cook, but 
adding spices is like mixing chemicals. 
It's just chemistry.

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
I guess, in a way...but I also feel 
like that's not all there is to it.

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
So do you and (YUR) use your 
own special seasonings? Is that 
why your food is so good?

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
Exactly. If you just rely on 
the recipe, your cooking will 
never be really delicious.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
Cooking is hard, but I'll keep trying. I 
want to learn how to make better food!

## POINTER 11
(JUD)
That desire is the most 
important thing of all.
