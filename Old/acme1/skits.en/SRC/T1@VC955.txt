Don't Mess With Zaude

## POINTER 1
(RAV)
When someone as strong as Phaeroh tells ya not 
ta go messin' with Zaude, it makes ya wonder.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
I wish he'd use regular words 
when he talked, though.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Definitely. If it's really all that dangerous 
you'd think he'd want to make himself clear.

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
Maybe it was something Phaeroh had difficulty 
expressing, in his own way.

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
He did take the time to warn us. That shows at 
least some concern for our well-being. Right?

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
You mean that maybe he's warmed up to us a bit.

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
Yes.
