I'm just a bother for everyone. 
I fought with (YUR) when we started 
out, but recently...

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
(YUR) says that he doesn't 
want ya ta get hurt.

## POINTER 3

You must be very important 
to him. I'm jealous.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
Huh? Y-you mean...

## POINTER 5

of (YUR), anyway?

## POINTER 6

Oh, come on, it's obvious...

## POINTER 7

P-please, stop...! You 
have the wrong idea...

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
What are you two adults trying to 
convince (EST_P) of this time?

## POINTER 9

Oh, does our genius mage 
want in on this, too?

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
(YUR)'s just been keeping her out 
of battle because (FRE) asked 
him to take care of her, right?

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
Th-that's right. That's what 
it is! There's nothing else 
to it. Nothing at all...

## POINTER 12

Poor (EST_P)...

## POINTER 13
(RAV)
Oh! It's absolutely heartbreaking!

## POINTER 14
