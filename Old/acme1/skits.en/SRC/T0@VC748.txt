Witcher and (RIT)

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
Hey, (FRE) said that mage Witcher 
was from Aspio, didn't he?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Did you know him from before, (RIT)?

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
...Hmm.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
What do you mean, "hmm?"

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
I get the feeling he might have passed through 
my field of vision once or twice...

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
It's nothing more than a vague memory, though.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
I think I know why Witcher had 
such a chip on his shoulder...
