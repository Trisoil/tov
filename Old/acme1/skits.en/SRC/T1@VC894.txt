Fighting Alexei

## POINTER 1
(JUD)
I'd like to know one thing before we begin this 
battle. Just how strong is this Commandant?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
I heard he earned his knighthood when he won a royal 
tournament during the previous emperor's reign.

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
I got to cross swords with him once, and 
I didn't last more than three minutes.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
So then he's really, really strong...

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
And don't forget he's surrounded by his Royal Guard.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
None of this sounds very promising...

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Hey, we've got Dein Nomos, don't we?

## POINTER 8
(RAP)
Woof, woof!

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Besides, we've been through all kinds 
of stuff together on this journey.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Yeah. We're tighter than any 
kind of guard, royal or not.

## POINTER 11
(RAV)
All right, so say we handle the Royal Guard. 
It's still a coin toss, in the end.

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
I guess we'll never be too prepared 
when it comes to facing Alexei.

## POINTER 13
(JUD)
Right. We'll have to give it everything we've got.
