Huh? Are you catching a cold, (EST_P)?

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
No... It's just...I've been so 
cold, ever since I saw (RIT) use 
that water magic of hers...

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
That's terrible! Are you sure 
you're oka--ACHOO...!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Now it's both of you? You should 
just tell (RIT) to stop using 
that kind of magic.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
I can hear (RIT) already. 
"I'll decide what type of magic 
I use, thank you very much!"

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Oh, come on. If we tell her that 
we might be coming down with 
colds, I'm sure she'll--

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
What's that? Something about me? Kchoo!

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Hey, you catch a cold too?

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
...Maybe someone's...talking 
about me behind my back...
