Yeager

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
I'm still trying to get my head around the 
fact that Regaey was Yeager's alter ego.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
This spells out the connection between Ruins' 
Gate and Leviathan's Claw pretty clearly.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
And that Yeager was the boss of both guilds.

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Isn't it kinda early ta say that for sure?

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
It is possible that the Regaey we met 
was just Yeager puttin' on a show.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
Maybe the real Regaey's off in some ruins someplace, 
just diggin' away, happy as a clam.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
We're gonna have a hell of a time, 
if it's really that complicated.

## POINTER 8
(RAV)
I dunno, maybe I'm just puzzlin' over it a little too hard.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
We'll have to keep at it until we get to the bottom of this mess.
