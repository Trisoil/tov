In the Don's Wake

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
It seems that the Union is still in disarray.

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
They relied on the Don for too much.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
They're probably scared without the guy 
who used to decide everything for them.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
I think I know 
how they feel.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Constantly worrying whether or not you're 
about to make some big mistake.

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
Well I can't understand being 
so afraid of messing up that 
you can't decide anything.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
Wow. I agree with you for once.

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
The Union has to do a lot of thinking 
for themselves, now that they're 
without the Don...

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
Isn't that how it should be?

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
Absolutely.
