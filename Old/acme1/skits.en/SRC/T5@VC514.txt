(YUR)
What's the matter, (KAR)?

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
I...I just saw a b-bug... 
I hate this forest!

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Come on, this place is tons better 
than the Blade Drifts of Zopheir, 
isn't it? What's a few bugs?

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
And too much cold'll kill ya! ∀

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
You'll be fine in the cold if you just 
bundle up. There's nothing you 
can do about a desert, though.

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
Yes, you have to remove clothing, 
and there's a limit to how 
much you can take off.

## POINTER 8
(RAV)
Maybe yer just not taking enough off! ♪

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
Ow...!

I also can't stand being 
on the Atherum.

## POINTER 12

There sure are a lot of places 
you don't like going, (RIT).

## POINTER 13
(RIT)
Well, what about you?

## POINTER 14
(JUD)
I don't like the Heracles very much, 
myself. That giant blastia's just...

*Wooof!*

## POINTER 17
(YUR)
What about you, (EST_P)?

## POINTER 18
(EST_P)
Huh? Me? I prefer places without 
monsters, personally.

## POINTER 19
(KAR)
Places without monsters... 
You mean inside barriers.

## POINTER 20
(EST_P)
Huh? That's not what 
I meant, exactly...

## POINTER 21
(YUR)
I think I know what you meant.

## POINTER 22
(RIT)
I wish the whole planet was like that, 
but that's just not how it works.

## POINTER 23
(EST_P)
Yes, I know...
