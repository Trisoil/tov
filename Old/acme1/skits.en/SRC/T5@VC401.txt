(YUR)'s Life

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Hey, (YUR), where in the lower quarter 
do you sleep? It's not under 
a bridge or something, is it?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
What do you think I am?

## POINTER 3
(RAP)
*Whine...*

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
All right, so where did you live?

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
I stayed at an inn after I 
left the Imperial Knights.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
The innkeeper is really nice and 
said I could stay there if I didn't 
have anywhere else to go.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
I'm finally starting to get a real image 
of you living in the lower quarter.

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Yeah, I can just see you bumming 
around down there.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Gee, thanks.
