You're pretty moody yourself, (RIT).

Just shut up!

## POINTER 6

Heh heh. I'm so glad 
we found you here.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
I mean, I gave up going back to the 
capital, so even if you had visited me, 
I wouldn't have been there!

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Oh, how sweet, (RIT). 
You were gonna go visit (EST_P).

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
I...I wouldn't go to the capital just 
to visit someone.

## POINTER 10

on the aer krene.

That sounds like an excuse 
for a visit with (EST_P) to me.

## POINTER 13

Y-you stay out of this!

## POINTER 14
(YUR)
Aw come on. We're all together again. 
Let's just be happy about that.
