The Scheming Partners

## POINTER 1
(JUD)
Oh, those two scheming together.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
What, you mean Cumore and Yeager?

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Yes. Maybe they saw that they had 
a lot in common with each other.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
A lot in common?

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Like being raving lunatics. Whatever the 
case, they made one hell of a combo.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Looking at those two made 
me feel totally normal.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Get a couple of nasty people 
together, and they'll put 
together some nasty plans.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
We were right to let (FRE) deal with it 
before things got really out of hand.
