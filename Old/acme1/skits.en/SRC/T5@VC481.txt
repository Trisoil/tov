The Island of Crystals

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
Gusios must have incredible power. 
The Entelexeia are amazing.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Do you mean all of the 
crystals everywhere?

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
It's unbelievable. There used 
to be nothing here, and now 
there's an entire island...

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
I think there are a lot of 
factors besides Gusios's power 
that made it this big.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
It was probably aer, ocean currents, 
and elemental spirits that were 
kept in reverse barriers.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
So ya think all those came together 
and formed an island of 
crystals in a short time?

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
What an amazing ability, to be able 
to make something so beautiful...

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
Gusios probably continued to make 
crystals to protect his own body.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Well, the crystal island itself won't 
get any bigger than this, though.
