Is This the Curse?

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
We can't seem to find our way 
through this forest at all. 
Oh! Could this be the curse?!

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
What should we do, (YUR)?! There 
really was a curse after all!

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Don't be stupid...

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
Or...do you not have a good 
sense of direction?

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
No, of course I do...I think...

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
Then maybe it's my fault...?! 
What should we do...?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
They say no medicine can cure a 
fool, but I wish something could 
cure a bad sense of direction...
