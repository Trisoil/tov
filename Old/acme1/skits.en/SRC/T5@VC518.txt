Ba'ul's On His Own

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
It's been a long time since 
we first came here.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
I wonder if Ba'ul's taking good 
care of things in our absence.

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
Or maybe he's tired of being in 
such a dark place, and went home!

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
Come on, (RAV). He's at least 
more dependable than you are.

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
If you kids are gonna say stuff like that 
ta me, maybe I'll go back fer real!

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Go ahead.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
But isn't it tough on Ba'ul, 
being near a magic field?

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
Yes, the Ba'ul of a few years ago might 
not have been able to withstand that.

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
Even though he's young for an Entelexeia, 
Ba'ul has grown. I'm sure 
he's just fine right now.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
You really trust Ba'ul, don't you, (JUD)?

## POINTER 11
(RAV)
I wish (JUD) trusted me like that...
