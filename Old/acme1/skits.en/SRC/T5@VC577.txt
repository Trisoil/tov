Histories

## POINTER 1
(RAV)
So (YUR) has a history, too...

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
I'd like to know where 
all of you came from.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Hmmm, where should I start...?

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
We already know what you're 
going to say, you big wuss.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Urgh... Fine, (RIT), then how about you?

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
I've done research in 
Aspio for a while.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Jeez, big shocker there. ...What 
about you, (JUD)?

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
Me? I lived in a town before I 
met Ba'ul. Everybody called me 
a prim and proper little girl.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
You gotta be kidding. (EST_P)...you 
grew up in the castle, right?

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
Yes. I spent all of my time in 
the castle, reading books. I'm 
so jealous of all of you.

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
See, no surprises, just 
like (RIT)'s story!

## POINTER 12
(RAV)
Doesn't anyone want ta ask 
ol' (RAV)? I might have some 
interestin' tales ta tell?

## POINTER 13
(RIT)
In your case, old man, I think I've got 
a pretty good idea what you'd say.

## POINTER 14
(RAV)
My past might spin ya fer a loop 
and have ya fallin' head over 
heels fer me! Ya don't know!

## POINTER 15
(YUR)
I can't say you've established 
a lot of credibility so far as 
stories are concerned, old man.

## POINTER 16
(RAV)
Don't be so cold! Come on, 
let me tell my story!
