The Promise of Hypionia

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
Thanks to (FRE), it seems like everyone 
in the town has settled into their 
lives here quite nicely.

## POINTER 2

*Woof*

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
It has the same climate as the capital. 
That might make it easier for 
them to live in the town.

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
And people lived on this continent 
before everyone came with (FRE). 
The land was for humans.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
It'll be nice if more and more people 
come to live on Hypionia.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
Exactly. Home is where the heart is.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
I wouldn't mind living here myself...
