A Barrier in an Oasis

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
Why would someone set up a barrier 
in a place like this?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Actually, they discovered the blastia 
at the bottom of the oasis, and 
have just been using it as is.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
A nice person in town told me that.

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
And with it sunk in the oasis, no 
one could move it, so I guess they 
had to leave it where it was.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
No one would trudge out into 
a scorching wasteland like this 
just to set up a barrier.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Ah, that explains it. Guess there's 
a reason for everything.
