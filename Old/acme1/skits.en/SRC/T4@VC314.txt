Let's Eat Already!

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
I...am...so...hungry...! We're 
seriously gonna starve!

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
Save your energy, (KAR). You'll 
just make yourself hungrier.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
Sharp stomachs make 
short graces, (KAR).

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
...What does that mean?

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
It means hunger can make you rude...and 
that leads to angry people attacking 
you with sharp things.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
I think yer a little off...

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
But whatever, (YUR) and (RIT) seem 
ta be pretty calm despite not 
havin' eaten in a while.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
I'm used to it.

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
I'm used to it.

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
Uh huh...

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
Ah! ...There's a delicious steak, 
right on top of (RAP)'s back...

## POINTER 12
(JUD)
It's a trap! Don't succumb 
to temptation.

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
Maybe we should do something 
about this...

## POINTER 14
(KAR)
(YUR)! (YUR)! I found a green piece 
of veggie-bread in my bag! 
I can eat it, right? Right?

## POINTER 15
(YUR)
What the... No, (KAR), don't!

## POINTER 16
(YUR)
Seriously, this is getting dangerous. 
Let's eat something already!
