## POINTER 1
(YUR)
First, Alexei lost (FRE). 
Now he lost you too, (RAV).

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
That's gotta hurt the strength of his precious Knights.

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
I don't know. He's still got his own personal 
Royal Guard with him, ya know.

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Those guys're fiercely loyal to 
him. They'll never betray him.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
You mean they still trust him? What could 
they possibly see in that piece of crap?

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
Well, Alexei wasn't a piece of 
crap when he got his start.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Huh?

## POINTER 8
(RAV)
It was his responsibility ta bring peace ta 
the world... That's a heavy load for anyone.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
...That's enough. The less 
I know about him, the 
easier I'll cut him.

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
Hah hah. Now that's the (YUR) I know.
