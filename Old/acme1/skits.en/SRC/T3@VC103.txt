Even Dogs Have Pride

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
I don't understand (RAP). He's 
a dog, with claws and fangs, 
but he uses weapons...?

## POINTER 2
(RAP)
*Grr... Woof*

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Yeah, I guess dogs do usually 
fight with claws and fangs.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
Huh? But (RAP)'s a dog, isn't he?

## POINTER 5
(RAP)
*Woof woof!*

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
(RAP) is (RAP).

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
...What does that mean?

## POINTER 8
(RAP)
*Woof woof! WOOF!*

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Whatever he is, (RAP) doesn't think 
of himself as a dog. That's why 
he uses weapons and items.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
But that's not to say that he thinks 
of himself as a human, either.

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
...I don't really understand... 
But he seems very proud.

## POINTER 12
(RAP)
*WOOF!*

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
Yep! So show him some respect!

## POINTER 14
(KAR)
...Hey, (YUR). Are you translating 
what (RAP)'s saying?

## POINTER 15
(YUR)
Nah, it's just your imagination.
