## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Good job! I knew you 
could do it, (EST_P).

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Thank you!

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
You twerp, you're only saying 
that now so you can look good.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
N-no, I mean it!

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Oh really...? Anyway, congratulations, 
(EST_P).

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
Thank you! I'm glad I could 
spread a little joy.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
That's good. You looked pretty serious 
out there. I was worried.

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
Well... I just felt like I was on 
display for everyone to see...

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
It's not a very good feeling 
to have people betting on 
whether you'll win or lose.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
Yes...but then I realized I 
should focus on my opponent, 
not the people watching me.

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
The more you want to beat your 
opponent, the happier you 
are when you finally win!

## POINTER 12
(YUR)
Yeah, I guess so. I'm glad it was 
a good experience for you, (EST_P).

## POINTER 13
(EST_P)
Yes! And all of your encouragement 
makes me want to work even harder!
