Ya Love Me!

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
This really feels like 
a deserted island.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Ohhh, walking around outside like this, 
you really start to feel the sun...

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
Yeah, with sea on all sides, there's 
nothin' to give us any shade...

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
You don't like it? I think this 
is a very lovely place.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Even if it is, the people in this town 
are absolutely crazy.

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
Yeah, it sure seems like the people 
here follow their own path.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
People? They seem more like 
farm animals to me...

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Sure, it's a weird place...but 
isn't the scientist in you just
a little curious?

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
Yeah, mystery makes things more 
interestin'. It certainly makes me 
more interestin'.

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
Mystery? I'd say it's more like lying 
and cons in your case, (RAV)...

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
It's nothing but fraud, for 
the old man! F-R-A-U-D!

## POINTER 12
(YUR)
You sure? I think it's more like 
fairy tales, in his case.

## POINTER 13
(RAV)
Aww, you like me don't you!

## POINTER 14
(RAV)
How flattering...
