Missing Phaeroh

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
So after all we went through to cross 
the desert, we can't meet Phaeroh.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
And after you've all risked 
your lives to help me...

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Maybe it's better that we didn't find him after all...

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Yeah. If we had to fight 
him now, we probably 
wouldn't make it out.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Think about it though, Phaeroh can fly. He's 
free to be pretty much anywhere at anytime.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Tracking him down will be a tall order unless 
he's got a lair somewhere in the area.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
......

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
No one's saying that meeting him will be impossible.

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
We might get some information 
if we ask around in the town.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
You're right. Thank you, both of you.
