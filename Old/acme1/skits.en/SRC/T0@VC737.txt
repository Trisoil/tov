So tell me about this frail 
girlfriend of yours, (KAR).

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Wha?!

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
The reason you want to 
go to Nor Harbor is so 
you can see her, isn't it?

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
H-how do you know about her?!

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
I knew it!

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
N-no! I mean, she's not 
even in Nor Harbor...

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Oh, it's not Nor Harbor?

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
I d-don't know what 
you're talking about!

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
You might as well come 
clean, (KAR). It's obvious 
(EST_P)'s not going to give up.

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
You've got it all wrong!

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
