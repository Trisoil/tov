This figurine is lovely!

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
A figurine? I'd say it's more 
like a toy, really.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
You must not have seen many things 
like this in the castle, (EST_P).

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
I'd like to see more of these figurines!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
And thus a figurine collector is born...

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
Oh, some people are just more interested
in aesthetics than others, (YUR).
It's not all that unusual.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
Yeah, I don't really have any 
interests outside of blastia.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
I've always been a fan of 
cool guild emblems, myself.

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
What about you, (YUR)?

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Huh? I've never really given much thought 
to artistic sorts of things.

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
I never really looked 
at anything like art.

## POINTER 12

Ask me, ask me!

## POINTER 13

Ask me what I like...

## POINTER 14

Girls!

## POINTER 15
(EST_P)
Girls!

## POINTER 16
(KAR)
Girls!

## POINTER 17
(RIT)
Girls!

## POINTER 18
(JUD)
Girls!

## POINTER 19
(RAV)
...Th-that's right...

## POINTER 20
(RIT)
We KNOW it's right!
