Altosk, Fortune's Market, Ruins' 
Gate, and the Blood Alliance...

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Huh, that makes us one short.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Huh? What are you talking about?

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
The Union's five master guilds. 
We've dealt with four of them, 
but not the last one...

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Oh. Hey, I don't think I even knew 
the last one's name... Hey, (KAR). 
What's the last guild called?

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Ah, that'd be the blacksmithing 
guild, the Soul Smiths.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Huh. I didn't know they had 
a guild for that, too.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
You've probably used swords forged by the 
Soul Smiths without even knowing it.

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
You've seen weapons embossed 
with an iron hammer, right? 
That's their guild emblem.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Oh, yeah, the innkeeper where I 
used to stay had a kitchen knife 
with something like that on it.
