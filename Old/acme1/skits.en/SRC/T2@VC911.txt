How Phaeroh Feels

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
We're lucky Phaeroh decided 
to help us out.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
He's a little extreme, but there's 
no doubt he cares for this 
world, just like (JUD_P) said.

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
I've been hard on him in the past, 
but he has helped us out all this time.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
We must defeat the Adephagos and save the world 
for Phaeroh, and his love of the world!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Agh, no cheesy lines.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
Yeah, come on...

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Honestly, you two should learn 
to show your feelings.
