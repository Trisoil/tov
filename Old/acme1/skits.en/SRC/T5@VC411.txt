Torim, the Center of Trade

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
Torim feels a lot more like a port 
city than Nor did, don't you think?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Yes, it's lively, and the 
port is full of ships.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
That's because Torim is run by 
Fortune's Market. They control 
shipping all over the world.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
I'm pretty sure Fortune's Market 
has their headquarters in Torim.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
I guess business can keep a city 
running if people want it to.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
I never would've thought of that.
