I-I'm sorry. Did you hear 
that just now...?

Yeah, we heard it.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
You talk to your sword?!

## POINTER 8

It cuts better when I do that.

## POINTER 9

Actually, we just won this battle 
because I gave my sword lots 
of encouragement before.

Nothing... Thank you for all the 
work you do. We can't wait to see 
how well you perform next time!

## POINTER 15

It must be tough having such

the only one we can count on.
