What Are We Here For?

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
A town with a coliseum sure 
attracts a lot of different 
kinds of people, doesn't it?

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
Yes, people are here for all 
sorts of reasons. Some come 
to fight, some come to watch.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Then there's people like us, too.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
I wonder what other people think 
when they see us on the streets?

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
Well, I'd say they think we're 
here for the fights...

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Maybe for you and (YUR), but I couldn't 
imagine (EST_P) as a gladiator 
if my life depended on it.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
What about me?

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Hmm...a lost child?

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Hey!

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
Well then, what about ol'... Nevermind. 
I know where this is goin'.
