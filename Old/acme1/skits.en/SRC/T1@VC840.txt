A Day in the Sun

## POINTER 1
(RAV)
We keep goin', and goin', but all we 
get is more sand and more blue sky.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
You're doing better than me if you can look at 
the sky, (RAV). The only thing I see is sand.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
...How come an old fart like you 
has so much energy, anyway?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Talking's only gonna wear you out.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
If one of us goes down, it'd be about all 
we could manage to get them back to safety.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
And I for one am in no mood to be giving out piggy-back rides.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
If I collapse, (RAV), you can carry me.

## POINTER 8
(RAV)
Sorry, but this back's reserved for ladies only.

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
I'll die before I collapse.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
I won't let myself be a burden, either.

## POINTER 11
(JUD)
The same goes for me, of course.

## POINTER 12
(RAV)
Hey, there's no reason ta go stompin on an old man's feelin's, is there?
