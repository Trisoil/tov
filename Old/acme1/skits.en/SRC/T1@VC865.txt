Phaeroh's Words

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
All that stuff about the balance of the 
world is pretty hard to take in...

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Yeah.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
I hadn't even been outside the capital 
until just a while ago myself.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
And now we're here talking about the fate of the 
world. You never know what life'll bring you.

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
But isn't that what makes it interesting?

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
I don't think we can afford to be that relaxed 
anymore. (EST_P) doesn't have much time left.

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
What's the harm? It's not as if acting 
all serious is going to solve anything.

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
Besides, (EST_P) will notice 
if we look all worried.

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
W-well, maybe so, but...

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
We won't forget what 
Phaeroh said. Relax.

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
I know, it's just...

## POINTER 12
(YUR)
(EST_P)'s got it the worst. If we get too down 
about this, we won't be much help to her.
