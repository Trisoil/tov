(RAV)'s Demons

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
(RAV), you haven't fought with 
us much at all, have you?

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
Oh no! Quite the contrary!

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
What do you mean?

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
While you all have been busy fightin' 
yer own battles, I've been doin' 
some fightin' of my own!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Are you saying we've just been too caught 
up with our own fighting to notice?

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
Huh? B-but I looked over during a 
battle the other day. You were just 
hanging around like normal...

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
Well ya never know when the 
demons of sleep or hunger 
will rear their ugly heads!

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
I see... That must be tough, what with 
the lack of urgency or any real danger.

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
Hehe, and yet you always 
suffer a crushing defeat!

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
It's so true... So maybe ya can swap me 
in sometime soon? I'll work hard...
