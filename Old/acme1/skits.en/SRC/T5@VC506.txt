If Only It Could...

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
I'm pretty certain the ring's 
not going to change form any 
more than it already has.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
It sure has gotten a lot of new capabilities 
since we first got it.

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
Aww, but it's kinda sad ta think that 
this is all we'll get from it...

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
You were hoping it would 
get even more, huh?

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Yeah, me too! I thought it would be able 
to do a lot more things! Too bad...

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
What else do you want it 
to do, Captain (KAR)?

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Hmm, let's see...

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
I think it'd be kind of fun if 
it let us talk with animals!

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
That would be great!

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
I'd like to talk to (RAP).

## POINTER 11
(RAV)
Nah, I think I'd prefer some more 
practical capabilities, myself.

## POINTER 12
(JUD)
Don't you think it's already 
pretty practical as it is?

## POINTER 13
(RAV)
Nah... Now, if it could tell me what 
yer thinkin', (JUD), then maybe...

## POINTER 14
(RAV)
Or if it could make pretty girls 
fall in love with ol' (RAV)...

## POINTER 15
(RAV)
Or if it could see through 
yer clo--

## POINTER 16
(RIT)
You just want it for your 
perverted fantasies!

## POINTER 17
(RIT)
It's a Sorcerer's Ring, 
not a Sleazebag Ring!

## POINTER 18
(RIT)
Ooh, I've had enough of this!
I should kill you!!!

## POINTER 19
(YUR)
Oh hell...

## POINTER 20
(YUR)
Hey old man, what do you wish 
the ring could do now?

## POINTER 21
(RAV)
Ur...urgh... Go back in 
time...shut me up...
