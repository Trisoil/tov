Gusios' Sacrifice

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Was Gusios in Caer Bocram in 
order to feed on the aer?

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
Yes. That's how the Hunting Blades managed 
to trap him in their reverse barrier.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
So is that what you and Ba'ul were doing 
there, (JUD_P)? Did you go to save Gusios?

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
Not originally. We went there to destroy the 
hermes blastia creating the reverse barrier.

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
Besides...in the end I was 
unable to save Gusios.

## POINTER 6
(BAU)
......!

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
He wasn't allowed to decide whether he 
was for or against becoming a spirit.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
It's not your fault... There was 
nothing else you could've done.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
We won't let his sacrifice be for nothing. We'll 
use the spirits well, and defeat the Adephagos.

## POINTER 10
(JUD)
Right...

## POINTER 11
(BAU)
......!

## POINTER 12
(JUD)
Yes... Ba'ul says that aside from spirit conversion, 
he will do everything in his power to aid us.

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
I'm glad he's on our side.
