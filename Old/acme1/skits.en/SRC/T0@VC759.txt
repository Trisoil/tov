The Hunting Blades

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
What do the Hunting Blades 
mainly do, as a guild?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Like their name says, they make 
their living hunting monsters.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
It's not like there's any shortage of monsters 
once you're outside the barriers.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Business must be booming.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Yeah, they definitely get a lot of commissions.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
But the Hunting Blades aren't killing monsters 
just because someone asked them to.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Monsters are evil. This evil must be punished.
That's the creed of the Hunting Blades.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
I wonder if any of them are doing it just for 
their own personal grudges against monsters.

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Oh yeah. A lot of people. 
Like, Nan's parents were killed right 
before her eyes when she was a kid.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Huh. It'd be hard not to hold a grudge after something like that.
