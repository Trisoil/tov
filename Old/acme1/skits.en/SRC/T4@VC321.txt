(EST)'s Cooking Practice

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
Hey (EST_P), you've been doing most 
of the cooking. You could let the 
guys cook every now and then.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
No, it's fine! The more 
I cook, the better I get.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
That's true. Cooking is something 
you get used to. I think your 
cooking has really improved.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
Thanks, (JUD)! I'm happy that 
I have your seal of approval.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Every day I shred two vegetables, 
julienne one, and chiffonade two 
more. Guess it was worth it.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
You didn't have to do all 
that... Right, (YUR)?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Yeah. It's a waste of veggies.

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
I think you missed the point.

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
No, it's okay. (RAP)'s been 
eating all of the vegetables 
for me, besides the onions.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
(RAP)!!

## POINTER 11
(RAP)
*...Whine*

## POINTER 12
(JUD)
Ahh, I thought (RAP) was 
getting a little pudgy.

## POINTER 13
(RAV)
Ya, his attacks in battle've been 
leavin' a bit ta be desired, too.

## POINTER 14
(YUR)
(RAP), you've gotta learn 
how to say no to food...
