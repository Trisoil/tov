Three in One

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
The two barrier blastia of this 
city and Nor harbor were originally 
a single blastia.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Did you read that in one of your 
books back in the castle?

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
Yes. Actually, there were three 
pieces. The last piece sunk in 
the sea between the two cities.

## POINTER 4

I wonder if you could raise that 
blastia. And if you sold it, you 
could live like a king forever!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
The Empire would've already done 
it if they could. Any idiot 
could come up with that idea.

## POINTER 6

...You don't have to be mean about it.
