The Sea Breeze

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
The breeze that blows in a port city 
makes everything feel so different.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
It smells like the sea...

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Stand in the ocean wind too long and 
you'll get covered in salt, you know.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
...Thank you for ruining my mood.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Hey, feel free to get all sticky 
and gross! I won't stop you.
