Belius

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
Just what sort of person 
is this Belius exactly?

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
Well that's just it. I've heard the name often 
enough, but I've never met the person.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
(KAR), do you know?

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
I've only lived in Dahngrest, so I don't 
really know the guilds in Nordopolica.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
The last thing we need is 
another Don on our hands.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
Heh, you can say that again. 
One Don is plenty.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
I can hardly wait to meet Belius now.
