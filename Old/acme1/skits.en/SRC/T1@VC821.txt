Do you think the others are all right?

## POINTER 2

You should probably worry a little 
more about how we're doing.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
There's no telling what might 
happen on a boat this sketchy.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
You say that, but you sound like 
you're enjoying all this.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Maybe that's why I don't feel 
all that scared myself.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Aww, man. This isn't gonna be half as 
fun if you're not properly terrified...

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Fun...?

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
...Never mind.
