Cook to Live

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
(YUR), you like cooking, don't you?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
I don't know about "like"... Why?

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
We've been making you cook for us all 
the time, and you haven't refused once.

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Quiet, (EST_P)! We don't 
want him ta stop!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
It's all right. I noticed.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
You don't mind? Isn't it a lot of work?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
I used to cook for myself when 
I was living in the capital. 
It's not bad at all.

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
It's not bad...but you 
don't really like it?

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Well...it was better than having 
to eat dangerously awful 
stuff every single day.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
He meant well, but he didn't 
realize how bad he was. This 
was the only way to stop him.

## POINTER 11
(RAV)
Ya got my condolences, (YUR).

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
Why are you looking at me?!

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
(RIT)'s cooking is nothing compared 
to this stuff, trust me.

## POINTER 14
(JUD)
I'd like to meet someone who 
could make food like that.

## POINTER 15
(RAV)
It's like lookin' at a scary monster. 
I'll pass on the food, though.

## POINTER 16
(YUR)
...You already met him.
