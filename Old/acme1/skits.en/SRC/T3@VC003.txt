The Strongest Guild

## POINTER 1
(RAV)
Enemies run an' hide when 
they hear our footsteps!

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
I can hear them now, "Here comes the 
invincible army, Brave Vesperia!" ♪

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
I don't care how many enemies 
we've beaten, you guys are just 
too full of yourselves!

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
But I don't think any enemy could 
stand up to us at this point!

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
See, even cute li'l (JUD) says so! ∀

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
But doesn't this make you a little 
uneasy? Getting this strong...

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
What do you mean?

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
What if everyone is afraid of us, or no 
one wants to be anywhere near us...?

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
Or maybe they'll capture us, and put 
us in a cage for everyone to see!

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
I-I see... I hadn't 
thought about that...

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
Come on, that would never happen!

## POINTER 12
(RAV)
Hey, a life of luxury in a cage, 
people attendin' ta my every need! 
Doesn't sound bad ta me!

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
...No matter how strong they get, 
some people never change...

## POINTER 14
(JUD)
...Heh heh... You're one to talk, (YUR).
