Just Use Both

## POINTER 2

What's up, (YUR)? Is something 
wrong with your weapon?

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
No, I was just thinking about how different 
axes and swords feel to use...

## POINTER 4
(RAP)
*Whine?*

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Ah, you use both swords 
and axes, don't you.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Yeah, but my artes change depending 
on which I use. It's not a 
problem or anything, but...

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Hmmm... Well, I think you look cooler 
when you're using axes, (YUR). It 
makes you look stronger, too.

## POINTER 8
(RAP)
*Woof!*

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
Really? I prefer (YUR) when 
he's using swords, myself.

## POINTER 10
(JUD)
You should just use one in each hand.

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
Give me a break...
