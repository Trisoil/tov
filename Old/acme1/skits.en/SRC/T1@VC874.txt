Just Who Is Duke?

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
Dein Nomos, the child of the full moon, 
"the resolve that impressed Phaeroh"?

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Just who the hell is this Duke guy?

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Well, judging from what he says, it 
seems he's in contact with Phaeroh.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
And he has the sword Prince Ioder's been 
looking for... I don't like this.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Yeah, but why would he just lend us 
something as important as Dein Nomos?

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
I thought he was stubborn, but maybe he's 
actually willing to listen to reason.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
I wouldn't get my hopes up about that.

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
Don't we have more pressing 
concerns to worry about?

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Yeah. Let's hurry.
