The illusion Phaeroh showed us... 
He was trying to make us feel 
the power of the Adephagos.

## POINTER 4

But it's no illusion this time... 
Oh man, are hordes of these things 
just gonna attack everything?

## POINTER 5

Woof! Woof!

## POINTER 6

Aaah!

## POINTER 7

Ow! Hey, no biting!

## POINTER 8

Grrr!

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
It's all right, (RAP). He's just 
a little nervous, that's all.

## POINTER 10

And what's wrong with being a little nervous? 
I'm not gonna run away or anything. I swear!
