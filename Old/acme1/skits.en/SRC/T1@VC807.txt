The Guild's Purpose

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
We picked a name, made laws, got our first job... 
We're a pretty respectable guild, now!

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
But are three members 
really respectable?

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Why not? The Dark Wings--the famous thieves' 
guild--they only have three members, too!

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
Quality over quantity.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Too many people get to be a headache. 
I prefer a small group.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
But you can't follow in the Don's footsteps and 
defend Dahngrest without a few more bodies.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Yeah, I guess... But, if 
we just put one foot in 
front of the other, I know 
we'll be big some day!

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
So then, you're saying we can take it easy.

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
No way! We've gotta give this guild 110 percent!

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Hah hah. Aye aye, Captain.
