History of the Hold

## POINTER 1

I wonder when Deidon Hold 
was originally built.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
From the looks of it, it's 
already seen several decades' 
worth of wear and tear.

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
People were already taking it for granted 
when ol' (RAV) was just li'l (RAV).

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
There was this guild I used to 
be in, and the leader was this 
really, really old guy...

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
He once told me that Deidon Hold 
was built back when his grandfather 
was a little kid.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
That'd make it at least 
a hundred years old, huh.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
So that makes the Lord of the 
Plains over a hundred years old. 
He must be an amazing man.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
