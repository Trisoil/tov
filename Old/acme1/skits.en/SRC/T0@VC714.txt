That woman who gave us directions--she 
said she was in a guild, right?

## POINTER 2

That was Ms. Kaufman, of Fortune's Market.

## POINTER 3

Man... Giving up their rights as imperial 
citizens and just...living free...

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
(YUR), are you interested in the guilds?

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Interested? Nah, I've just never had much contact with them.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Back in the capital there weren't any gritty guild 
types who'd refuse the Knights' protection.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
We may meet lots of people in guilds 
before we're done with our trip.

I hope they're a little less aggressive 
than that woman was.
