Nothing to Worry About

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Hmm... If that ceiling collapsed, 
we'd be buried alive.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Wh-what are you saying stuff 
like that for, (EST_P)?! What 
if that really happened?

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Come on, don't be such a wimp. 
These ruins are made of 
stronger stuff than that.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
Ahhh!! (EST_P), now the ceiling's 
going to collapse because you 
were talking about it! ...Huh?

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Oh, sorry. I just stubbed 
my toe on a rock.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
...You did that on purpose, didn't you?

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
(YUR)... You're mean...

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
C-come on, let's hurry and finish 
up what we're doing so we 
can get out of these ruins!
