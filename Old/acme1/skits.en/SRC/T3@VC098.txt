Not Enough Fat to Burn

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
It's f-f-freezing... Think there's 
a cabin or something where we 
could get out of the cold?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
I don't think anyone would build a 
cabin on top of a sheet of ice...

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
If we just had some fire...

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Oh yeah, (RIT), use yer magic ta 
give us some fire, would ya?

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
What am I, a walking matchbox...?

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
And besides, using it on YOU 
would be a waste of aer.

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
What's the big deal? Weren't 
ya usin' it over and over again 
just a little while ago?

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
That was to defeat enemies! What would 
you want me to set on fire, anyway?

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
Hmmm, you've got a pretty 
muscular body.

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
Huh...? Well, I mean, what with 
the guilds and the Knights and 
all, it's a lot of work...

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
...Doesn't look like there's enough 
fat to burn very well...

## POINTER 12
(YUR)
Hah hah. That's too bad.

## POINTER 13
(RAV)
...Huh? ...Hey!
