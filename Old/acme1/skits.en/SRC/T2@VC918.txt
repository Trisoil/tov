Sodia and (YUR)

## POINTER 1
(RAV)
(YUR)'s not too fond of 
young Sodia, is he?

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
I can see where he's coming from, though.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Everything about her feels hard as a rock. 
That's not exactly easy to like.

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Aw, cut her some slack. Knights 
are all a little square.

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
She has a stubborn nature that quick-to-act 
folks like you and (YUR) don't. 
And that's a good thing.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Stubborn is good...? You 
totally lost me there.

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
I figured I would. That's why 
we can't talk without gettin' 
on each other's nerves.
