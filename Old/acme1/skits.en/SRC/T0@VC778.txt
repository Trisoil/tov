(JUD)'s Armor

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
Hey, why were you wearing that 
stuffy-looking suit of armor?

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
Oh? You didn't like it?
It's pretty sturdy, and 
protects my body quite nicely.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
See? Look at this beautiful skin, 
free of bruises and blemishes!

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Very nice... I'm actually worried 
where my eyes might wander.

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
You don't look all that worried to me.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
I've just got a good poker face.
So, you're okay? You don't mind 
leaving your armor behind?

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
It's sturdy, but it's heavy. Walking 
around with that on tires me out.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Hey, no complaints here. I prefer 
eye candy to scary armor any day.
