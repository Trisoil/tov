The Parents

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Alph and Layla's parents don't seem to be anywhere.

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
And with the desert as brutal as all this, 
odds are they're not holdin' up too well.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Thanks, old man. This hot-as-hell desert 
was missing a looming sense of dread.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
How could Cumore just abandon people out 
here because they got on his nerves?

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Seriously.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Let's hurry up and find those kids' parents 
while we still have some strength left.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Right.
