A Dog's Thoughts on Battle

## POINTER 1
(RAP)
*AROOOOOOO!*

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
What was that? A victory howl?

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Yeah, something like that, I think.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
He's just a dumb beast, after all. 
He probably just thinks he had a 
successful hunt, or something.

## POINTER 5
(RAP)
*Woof!*

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
He can hear you, you know. (RAP) 
thinks about all sorts of things. 
You've offended him.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
What do you mean, all sorts of things?

## POINTER 8
(RAP)
*Woof! Woof woof!*

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
The significance of him winning 
a tournament that's held by the 
world of humans, for example.

## POINTER 10
(RAP)
*WOOF! WOOF!*

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
He's thinking about what a good chance 
it is to show humans how strong 
and proud the noble dog is.

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
What, your pooch is a philosopher? 
Don't make me laugh.

## POINTER 13
(RAP)
*WOOF! WOOF WOOF!*

## POINTER 14
(YUR)
So maybe you'd like to have a fight with 
(RAP), with your honor on the line?

## POINTER 15
(RIT)
Hey, I don't wanna fight you! 
Hey! Stop biting me, let go...!

## POINTER 16
(KAR)
...I've been wondering for a while, 
but... You understand what (RAP)'s 
saying, don't you, (YUR)?
