Gusios to Gnome

## POINTER 1
(RAV)
Whew. Old Goosie turned into Gnome, 
safe and sound. That's a load off.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Yes... It would have been 
tragic if he'd transformed 
into an Adephagos...

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Yeah. He's just fulfilling the 
role he was meant to play.

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
I doubt he ever thought that his transformation 
might have caused the cataclysm itself.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
...I feel for the poor Entelexeia 
who became Adephagos in the past...

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
If only they'd had the option 
of spirit conversion...

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
Young lady, don't dwell too 
much on all the "what ifs."

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
Maybe they didn't have a choice. 
But those who became Adephagos 
are trying to devour this world.

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
That is the reality.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
I know... But it's 
just so sad...
