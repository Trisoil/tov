Aersick

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
So aer is more than just a handy substance 
for making blastia work, huh?

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
The questions amateurs ask, I swear...

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Aer affects everything 
in the world.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Our own bodies, the growth of living 
organisms, even the weather.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
So the blastia in Ragou's palace that controlled 
the weather was interfering with the aer?

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Correct.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
So then, that means the aer here is interfering 
with the processes in our bodies.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
I mean, I can handle it, but is it really 
a good idea for us to be in aer this dense?

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
We shouldn't stay here too long. Especially 
runts like you who are still growing.

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
The younger you are, the more 
of an effect the aer will have.

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
Huh, guess that makes sense.
