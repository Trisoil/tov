The Hero of a New Town

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
It used to be just bare land, but it's 
starting to look like a real town now.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
It looks like they're building 
more and more houses, too.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Yeah. Look on that roof over there. 
That's the master carpenter 
of the carpenter's guild.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
He heard about Aurnion, and came with 
all his tools and apprentices to help.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
He even refused to take money 
for it. He's so generous!

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
Hmm, looks like the manly carpenters 
are out in full force!

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
You could learn a thing 
or two from them.
