Aer Krene

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
I never would've guessed there would be 
an aer krene in the Weasand of Cados.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
I guess nobody passing through 
ever noticed it.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
It must not have been putting out enough aer 
until now for anyone to feel the effects.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
It sure picked the perfect time to start 
going crazy.
That was a serious pain.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Well, I was able to log a new discovery, so it worked out in the end.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Yeah, so glad you enjoyed yourself.
