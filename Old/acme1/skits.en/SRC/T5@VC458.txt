A Map of the Shrine

## POINTER 1
(JUD)
It's so boring looking at the same 
types of rooms over and over again.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
No way! When you make a map, you 
realize how everything's laid 
out! It's really interesting!

## POINTER 3
(RAP)
*Whine...?*

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Would you say you're happy so 
long as you're making a map?

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Yeah! Nothing calls to a man's heart 
like the thrill of making maps!

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
I've never had that thrill. 
I just need a map to show me 
where I'm supposed to go.

## POINTER 7
(RAP)
*Woof*

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
Hey, wait! I still haven't written 
down all of the places where 
you can find monsters...!
