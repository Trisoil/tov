(RIT)'s Change

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
...Honestly, that girl...

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Huh?

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
(EST_P). She rushes off regardless of danger... 
She doesn't listen when you tell her to stop...

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
So (EST) has finally 
become (EST_P), huh?

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
I...I've been calling her that for 
a while... What's with you, anyway?

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Hey, you know... Your tone of voice was different, 
just then... Maybe it's just my imagination...

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
You're damn right, it is!

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
Ahh, there's the (RIT) we all know and love.

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Ow!

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
How about you just shut up? Who 
cares what I say or how I sound?!

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
Not me. Here's to you 
being you, (RIT).

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
Humph...!
