The State of Palestralle

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
You gotta hand it to Palestralle. They're tough.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Yes. The coliseum is as 
busy as it ever was.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Belius had a lot of power, but Palestralle 
didn't rely on her. That's way 
different from the Union.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
The people living here haven't 
changed, either. This is 
the city Belius made.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
They're doing all they can to live 
their lives. Maybe that's what defines 
this town, and Palestralle.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
The world can change all it wants. 
Nordopolica'll be okay.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Yes, it will.
