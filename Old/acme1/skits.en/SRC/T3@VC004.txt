Eat or Be Eaten

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Monsters are easier to 
beat than I thought...

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Isn't that better than being 
harder than you thought?

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
But I feel sorry for them...

## POINTER 4
(RAP)
*Whiiine*

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
...You're way too nice. I don't particularly 
enjoy being someone else's dinner.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
You're right... This is different 
from inside the castle... 
The strong eat the weak.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Well, we're not gonna be eating 
any of these monsters.

## POINTER 8
(RAP)
*Woof!*

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
...I...I won't hesitate 
to defeat any monsters!

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
But I will never forget what I 
fought or where I fought it.

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
Well...suit yourself, I guess...

## POINTER 12
(EST_P)
Then, when I return to the capital, 
I will make graves in memory of 
all the monsters I've killed.

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
I...uh...I guess you could do that...

## POINTER 14
(YUR)
...I don't understand 
this girl at all...
