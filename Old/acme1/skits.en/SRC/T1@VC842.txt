What was the deal with that weird monster 
we ran into in the Sands of Kogorh.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Just the thought of it still 
sends chills down my spine...

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Was that thing even alive...?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Huh? What do you mean?

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Well, it wasn't anything like other creatures 
that make their home in the desert...

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Huh. Another astute observation 
from Captain (KAR).

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Whatever it was, I hope we never see it again.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
Me too.
