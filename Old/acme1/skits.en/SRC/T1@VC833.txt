Regaey

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
Damn that Regaey...

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
What could he possibly want with that case?

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
Well, our genius mage's magic was kinda weird. 
He must have thought it was linked to that box.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
Then, you think Regaey 
knows what's in the box?

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
The only way we'll find out is by going after him.

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
If he stole it knowing what was inside, then he 
must know what the clear ciel crystal can do.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
If we catch him, we might learn 
something about Yormgen.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Okay, now we definitely can't let him get away.

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
Yes, we don't have a moment to lose.
