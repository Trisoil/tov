Be Thankful to Strangers

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
I need to thank whoever told you 
about this underground passage.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Why would you need to be thankful for something like that?

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
I'm trying to get out of the 
castle, just like you.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
That's all well and good...but there's no 
need to be all thankful because of it.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Oh no. We must show courtesy to 
those who show us kindness.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Sort of weird to be polite to somebody 
you've never met, don't you think?

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Manners are never so important as when dealing with 
those with whom we have yet to be acquainted.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
You really think so, huh?

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
I know so.
