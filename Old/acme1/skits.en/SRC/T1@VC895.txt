Phaeroh's Help

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
So Phaeroh's been absorbing aer, too.
Is he trying to restabilize it?

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
We owe him one for keepin' the 
fight up this long.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
No, I don't think that's it.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
My guess is he's taking in all that 
aer to disable Zaude's power source.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
That way he'll be able to mess 
with Alexei's plans, right?

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Right. ...Right, 
(JUD)?

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
...Who, me? What was the question?

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
...Never mind.

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
It'll be easy if we can just get inside. 
We'll stop everything in one shot.

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
Wish it were that easy, kid. But we'll be 
up to our ears in traps and royal guards.

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
Gotta admire his confidence.

## POINTER 12
(KAR)
...Do you really mean that?

## POINTER 13
(JUD)
...Phaeroh... Please be okay...
