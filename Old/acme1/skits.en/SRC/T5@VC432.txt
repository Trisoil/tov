Not Exactly Warm

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
The Fount of Warmth is like this 
phantom guild that people have 
only heard stories about.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
I never thought I'd see 
it with my own eyes...

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
A phantom guild, huh...

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
If they're a guild, then they must have 
their own rules and purpose, right?

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
The stories I've heard say their 
purpose is to provide the best 
service to their customers.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Rumor has it that any member
who's rude to a customer must
immediately take their own life.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
For how relaxed this place is, 
their rules sure are strict.
