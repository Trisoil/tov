## POINTER 1

This town has grown into 
quite a wonderful place.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Sure has. I can't believe 
it's a real city now.

## POINTER 3
(RAP)
*WOOF!*

## POINTER 4

All the refugees look happy, too. Even 
with all the danger left in our world.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
They're strong. They've figured out complaining 
doesn't get anything done.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
And that's not a bad 
thing to figure out.

## POINTER 7
(RAP)
*Woof*

## POINTER 8

Yes, I agree.
