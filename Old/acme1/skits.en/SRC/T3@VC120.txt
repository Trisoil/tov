Lucky?

## POINTER 1
(RAV)
I can't believe I've gone this 
long without dyin' in battle... 
This can't be good!

## POINTER 2
(RAP)
*Whine?*

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
It seems good to me. Or do you 
still not care about dying since 
you already died once?

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Mmm, I can't say that feelin's totally 
gone, but maybe it's lessened a tad.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Yeah? Then show it! Be happy!

## POINTER 6
(RAP)
*WOOF!*

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
Fate waits until you're on top 
of the world ta knock ya down. 
I gotta stay on my toes.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
So you're just going to keep pretending 
like you're troubled, and hope fate 
doesn't notice.

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
Smart kid. I'm gonna keep testin' my luck 
and see just how far it takes me.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Don't come crying to me when 
fate comes for payback!

## POINTER 11
(RAP)
*WOOF!*
