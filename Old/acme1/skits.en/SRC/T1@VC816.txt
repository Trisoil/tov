Yeager's Speech

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
That man called Yeager certainly 
had a unique way of talking.

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Unique isn't the word I'd use.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
I had a hard time understanding 
some of the stuff he said.

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
An ancient way of speaking, lost in this day and age...

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
What? Are you serious?!

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
...It would at least make a good story if that were true.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
*Sigh*
