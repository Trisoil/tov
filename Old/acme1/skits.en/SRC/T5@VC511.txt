Still a Lot to Learn

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Synthesis artisans are amazing. 
They produce such lovely items 
in such a short time!

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Yes, it really is an art. The quality 
is always second to none, too.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
And the same artisan is always 
sneaking into the cities we visit 
just before we get there.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
What?! Really?!

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
What?! Are you serious?!

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
Oh yeah. I wish I had half the vitality 
he has. We're nothing compared 
ta how much he gets around.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Yeah, right, okay. There's 
no way he could do that...

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
Really? Do you think it's more 
likely that the world's full 
of such skilled artisans?

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Y-you too, (JUD)?! Y-you 
really believe that??

## POINTER 10
(JUD)
And he must have great instincts, 
too. We should see about getting 
him to join Brave Vesperia.

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
R-really...? K-(KAR), the next time 
we meet him, let's see if he'll join.

## POINTER 12
(KAR)
R-right! Okay!

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
Whoa... I think those two actually 
fell for all that.

## POINTER 14
(RAV)
The princess and the kid still 
have a lot ta learn.

## POINTER 15
(RIT)
I hear they're actually using 
blastia to do the synthesis.

## POINTER 16
(JUD)
You know, maybe we got a 
little carried away...
