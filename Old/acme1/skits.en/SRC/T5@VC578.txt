Home, Sweet Home

## POINTER 1
(JUD)
Everyone in the lower quarter 
is so kind. It makes me miss 
my hometown a little.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
(JUD_P), isn't your hometown...

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Yes, it's gone.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Hometowns, hmm... I lived in 
Aspio, so I can't say I feel 
too nostalgic about this place.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Yeah, same with me and Dahngrest...

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
I...I miss the castle 
every now and then.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Yeah, you spent a long time there. I'm 
the same with the lower quarter.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
Where's your hometown, (RAV)?

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
Me? Hmmm... Dahngrest, I guess.

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
Huh? But you weren't born 
in Dahngrest, were you?

## POINTER 11
(RAV)
Well, if our journey ended now, 
I'd head back to Dahngrest... 
So I guess it's my hometown.

## POINTER 12
(EST_P)
Maybe our hometown is just the 
place we'd most like to go back 
to if we had the choice...
