The Tougher, the Better

That last battle was sure fast! 
I wish all battles were that easy.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Easy? I dunno, I didn't feel 
much of anything. I wanted a 
little more action, you know?

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
Oh, yer a fan of getting beaten 
to a pulp while strugglin' ta beat 
some crazed, giant monster?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Aw, don't put it like that, 
old man. It's not struggling. 
It's fun. Sooo much fun.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
The best part about a battle 
is its raw challenge!

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Its raw challenge, huh...

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
I kinda like the way that sounds! â™ª

## POINTER 8
(RAV)
Ehh, sorry, but I'd prefer to avoid 
the hard-fought battles. They're 
rough on these old bones.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
But that makes it even more fun!

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
How's that?

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
That's for you to find out, old man!
