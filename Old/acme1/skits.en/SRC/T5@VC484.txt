The Map Lover

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
I'd heard stories about it,
but man, they sure picked
a spot for a coliseum.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
It's at the tip of the continent 
of Desier, after all.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Now that you mention it, this continent 
has a pretty strange shape.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
I wonder why it's shaped the way it is?

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Hmm, I'll bet we might figure out why 
if we walked all the way around it.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
That's our map lover, Captain 
(KAR)! ...I don't love maps.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
No no. Don't be shy! It's 
a wonderful hobby.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
Ugh... That doesn't sound 
like a compliment at all...
