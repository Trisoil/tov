Beautiful Juggernaut

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
(JUD), you always go right 
for the enemies, don't you?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Yes, you never hesitate at all!

## POINTER 3
(RAP)
*Woof!*

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
*Giggle*

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
You're a juggernaut.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Huh? What does that mean, (YUR)?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
It means she charges like a boar!

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
A juggernaut means something 
that has so much inertia that it 
can't be stopped or redirected.

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Huh... Hey, (JUD)'s gone!

## POINTER 10
(RAP)
*Woof!*

## POINTER 11
(JUD)
Sorry, I'm back now.

## POINTER 12
(EST_P)
Where did you go, (JUD)?

## POINTER 13
(JUD)
Oh, I thought I saw something.

## POINTER 14
(JUD)
Seems like it wasn't 
a monster after all.

## POINTER 15
(YUR)
That instinct of yours to attack anything 
that moves reminds me of a wolf...
