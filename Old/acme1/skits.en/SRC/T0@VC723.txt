A Nia Fruit? Here?

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Why would a nia fruit be lying 
on the ground in the forest?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
I didn't see a nia 
tree nearby...

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Oh, that'd be the monsters in the forest. 
It's how they mark their territory.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
Can we really just take it, then? 
...I suppose there's no way 
for us to ask permission.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Yeah, I don't really speak "monster." 
(KAR), they don't teach that 
in your guild, do they?

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
The Hunting Blades hunt monsters! 
We don't need to waste time 
making friends with them!

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
...That's a shame.
