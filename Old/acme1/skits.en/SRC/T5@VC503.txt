So what's Ba'ul saying?

## POINTER 5

It seems that even he can tell 
he's bursting with power.

## POINTER 6

Awesome... Even Entelexeia 
grow up, huh?

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
Ba'ul's still very young, so he probably 
has a lot of growing left in him.

## POINTER 8

So young and already this big? 
Ol' (RAV) sure is jealous!

## POINTER 9

I think it'd be better if you grew 
up in a different way, old man.
