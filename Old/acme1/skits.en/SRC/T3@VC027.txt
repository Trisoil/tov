Enjoying Victory

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
With that, we've beaten all the 
world's Giganto Monsters!

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
I was a little spooked at 
first, but...we did it.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
We probably couldn't have done 
it if they gathered together 
like normal monsters.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Maybe they were just really 
territorial? ...That could 
have helped us beat them.

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
And we got a lot of valuable materials, 
too, since they were a lot stronger 
than normal monsters.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Yeah. It was a lot of hard 
work, but it was worth it!

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
And defeating all of the Giganto 
Monsters will help Brave Vesperia's 
reputation, as well.

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
How? It's a few monsters in 
parts of the world people 
have only heard stories about.

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
Yeah, these guys aren't the kind ya 
run across unless ya set out to.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Well, what's wrong with just 
being happy about it?

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
You don't seem too happy, (YUR).

## POINTER 12
(YUR)
Hmm? Yeah... I mean, I feel 
a sense of accomplishment, 
but also kind of empty...

## POINTER 13
(JUD)
Me too... Every time I beat 
a really tough enemy, I feel 
a little lonely inside...

## POINTER 14
(KAR)
...I'm pretty sure that's 
just the two of you...

## POINTER 15
(RIT)
These fighting addicts, I swear...
