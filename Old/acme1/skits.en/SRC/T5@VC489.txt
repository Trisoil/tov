Too High for Others?

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Wow, I can't believe we're walking around
on a never-before-explored continent!

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Who could make it up here? Even we 
wouldn't be up here if it weren't for Ba'ul.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
Yes, that's true.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
I think that's why there's no 
record of it in any histories.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
We're walking around 
on a really high place.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
The fog's so thick, you can't even see 
the ground from on top of the cliffs!

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
Ooh, scary!

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
One wrong move, and we
could find ourselves falling
straight down those cliffs!

## POINTER 9
(RIT)

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
There's no hope of surviving 
a fall like that...

## POINTER 11
(RAV)
Heh, we'd better walk carefully.

## POINTER 12
