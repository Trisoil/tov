The Sorcerer's Ring

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
I wonder if people a long time ago used little 
rings like this to move things around.

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Yes, items like this have been discovered 
in other ruins, as well.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
It sure is useful for something so small.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Yeah, unlike some people I could name.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Huh?

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
It's impressive that you've been entrusted 
with a Sorcerer's Ring, (RIT).

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
I've heard they're only given to 
a very small number of people.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Hmmm. Guess someone trusts you.

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
You're the only one who doesn't.
