The Cold Is Fatal

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
Who the hell thought it'd be 
a good idea to make s-s-sorbet 
in this freezing weather...

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
It's s-s-so cold, my t-t-t-teeth 
are chattering too much to eat...

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
I think sorbet can be delicious, 
even in the cold.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
So it was you!

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
I was just expressing my opinion... 
I never said it was me!

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
J-J-(JUD), you're all right eating 
sorbet d-d-dressed like that?

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
If ya get...an upset stomach, 
(JUD_P)...I'll give ya a massage!

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Th-th-that's hardly something you 
should be saying, with your p-p-purple 
lips and your runny nose!

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
(RIT), can you...cast 
spells...like that?

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
P-p-probably not... My t-t-teeth 
are chattering too much...

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
And my hands are t-t-too 
stiff to hold my weapons!

## POINTER 12
(YUR)
Eating sorbet...in a frigid cold field 
of snow... Th-th-this is not fun...
