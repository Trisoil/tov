Better Together

See how much better it is when we're all together?

## POINTER 2

It's times like these that give you a sense 
for how important cooperation really is.

## POINTER 3

Y-yeah, I guess.
The runt said 
something smart for once.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Not that we've done anything all that cooperative, yet.

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
That's all right.
Just being together 
makes this place less frightening.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
I wonder if it's really that simple.
Aiee! 
It's a four-legged hell beast!

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Aaah!

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Aaah!

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Gaaah!

## POINTER 10

Oops, my bad. Must've just 
been the pooch's shadow.

## POINTER 11
(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
You are so dead.
I'm going to kill you 
and leave you haunting this ship!
