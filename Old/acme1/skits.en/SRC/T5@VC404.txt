Unlucky Star

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
So, this Lord of the Plains isn't 
always prowling around?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Someone in the Hold said that he only 
appears just before the rainy season.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Huh. So he changes habitats 
depending on the season.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
I guess we must've come to 
the Hold at a bad time before.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
It looks that way. Normally, the 
Hold leaves their gates open.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
But not now, of course. Man, I must've been 
born under a really unlucky star...
