(FRE) in Danger

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
(FRE) always seems to 
put himself in danger.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
He's always that way. He doesn't mind getting 
hurt if it means protecting others.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Yeah, he gets a little crazy sometimes.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Like you're any different. 
Birds of a feather, right?

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
Oh, I'd say we're all like that.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Like what?

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
We all stuck with Brave Vesperia. 
Even when the goin' got rough.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Hah hah. I guess none of us 
can just let things go.

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
Right. So we can't just 
let (FRE) go either.

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
Yeah. Exactly.

## POINTER 11
(JUD)
Well since we can't let it go, I think 
it's time we get a little crazy.
