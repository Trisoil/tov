What They're After

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
I thought the Knights were the ones 
who had business in Nordopolica.

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
I never woulda guessed we'd end up 
runnin' into the Hunting Blades.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
What are they all doing here...?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Don't know, exactly, but you can be 
sure it's got to do with Belius.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Could it be that the Knights--I mean (FRE)--came 
because of Belius as well?

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
We'll have to ask the Duce. For now, though, we 
gotta see if we can get things under control.
