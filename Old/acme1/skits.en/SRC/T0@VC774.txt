The Don

Don Whitehorse...

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
I can see how a man like that 
could rise to the top of the 
Union. He's pretty impressive.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
I'm just relieved he's the sort of 
person who's willing to listen.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
I didn't think he'd give us a 
chance, considering that he's 
never met us before.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
That's what makes the Don so great!
I told you, right? Man, he's so cool!

Do you run his fan club or something?
