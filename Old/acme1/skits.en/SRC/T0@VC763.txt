(KAR) and Nan

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
*Sigh* This is awful...

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
......

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
You've been staring at (KAR) 
for a while now.
What's up?

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
I'm just worried about the fight 
he had with his friend, Nan.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
And he's clearly depressed.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
That wasn't a fight. It was 
a one-sided verbal beat-down.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
It's gotta be a good sign if she cares 
enough to criticize him that much.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
If she didn't care about him, she 
wouldn't even bother, right?

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
I suppose so...

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
*Sigh* I'm so hungry...

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
...Wait, THAT's what you 
were worrying about?!
