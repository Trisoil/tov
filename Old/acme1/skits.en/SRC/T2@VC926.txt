The Ancient Civilization

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
The ancient civilization of Geraios...

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
What must the people have been 
like who lived in an age that 
produced buildings like this?

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Well, I'm no expert on their lives, 
but I have some ideas from the 
blastia we've excavated.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Except for the Adephagos, from a scientific perspective 
their civilization was nearly perfect.

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
Their blastia would have given them power 
equal to that of the Entelexeia.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Oh, yeah. Otherwise, the Entelexeia 
would've wiped them out.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
People got too much power, and destroyed what they 
built in the process... It's not that uncommon.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
But there's one part of their legacy we're still paying for.

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
...Yep. They left behind the Adephagos for 
folks who came after them ta deal with.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Maybe they didn't have a choice, 
but that doesn't make it right. 
You take responsibility.

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
We...we'll have to own up 
to whatever choices we 
make from now on, too.

## POINTER 12
(KAR)
That's right. If we're gonna make a world without 
blastia...we gotta make sure it works.

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
Yeah, absolutely.
