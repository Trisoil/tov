We're a Guild

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
It's been a slow process, but 
Brave Vesperia has really come 
into its own as a guild.

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
I think it's still nowhere close 
to a full-fledged guild.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
But everyone's trying their best!

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Well, I guess the guild 
does have a good style.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
A good style?

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
We have the kid for comic relief, 
the Krityan as the love interest, 
and (YUR) as the straight man.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Oh. I thought you were talking about 
how fashionable our clothes were!

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
That'd make you the space cadet, then.

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
So you're the straight woman?

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
I'm not a member of your 
crazy comedy act.

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
...We're a guild, you know.
