One Mess after Another

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
Just when I get to relax...I get 
dragged into another mess!

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
(YUR), fate really 
is out to get you!

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Hey, it's not all my fault. You 
had a role in this, too!

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
But I never ran into gigantic monsters or 
got arrested by knights before I met you!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Well, things didn't go bad for me until 
I left the capital with (EST_P).

## POINTER 6
(KAR)

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Drop it. Keep moving.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
R-right.
