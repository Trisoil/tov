## POINTER 1
(KAR)
(RIT)'s a little scary, huh?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Really?

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
She's about what I'd expect. 
Seems like she's in a 
crappy mood, too.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
That's because you broke 
into her house, (YUR)!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
I don't exactly feel like being 
on my best behavior when 
I'm dealing with a core thief.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
What will you do if you're wrong about her?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
If I'm wrong, I'll apologize.

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
You'd better remember that 
when the time comes.

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Oh, were you listening?

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
I just happened to overhear.
So you think I'm scary, do you?

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
Watch it, (KAR).
She's definitely the 
kind to hold a grudge.

## POINTER 12
(KAR)
H-hey! D-don't 
scare me like that!
