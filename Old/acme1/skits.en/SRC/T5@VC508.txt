Money Goes 'Round

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Money seems to disappear 
before you know it...

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
No. It disappears because you use it.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Sure, but if you only use a 
little at a time, you don't realize 
how much you're spending.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
I guess we've been spending 
a little too much...

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
What do you mean? We 
need to spend more!

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
Really? But why...?

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
The more Gald we spend, the
more it comes back to us...and
it brings its friends, too!

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
R-really?

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
How interesting!

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
Huh...? (RIT), your name's 
on this money...

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
Exactly. I've been writing my 
name on our Gald so we'll know 
when it comes back to us.

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
And when it does comes back, 
I bet it'll have doubled, 
at least. So go on! Use it!

## POINTER 13
(JUD)
Heh. What a lovely little fairy tale.
