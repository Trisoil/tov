Geraios Technology

## POINTER 1
(RAV)
We've seen plenty of blastia so far, but this 
one's in a different class altogether.

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
If this was made at the end of the Geraios civilization, 
it may contain clues to all their technology.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Chances are pretty good, if the building we saw 
in that relief in Myorzo is actually Zaude.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
So is there a connection between 
the cataclysm and the Adephagos?

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
If it is does come from the end of the Geraios civilization, 
maybe it can turn back the Adephagos.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
I wonder if that's why they carved the relief. It all 
adds up, but I keep going back to Phaeroh's words.

## POINTER 7

About disturbin' Zaude? Thinkin' about it isn't 
likely ta get us anywhere. We just have ta go on.
