People were just living normally, and then the 
capital winds up like this all of a sudden.

Not really a situation where you can just tell people to calm down.

Alexei... What the hell are you thinking?

Whether he can control the people or not, the 
world is headed for a crisis if this keeps up.

## POINTER 9

But just try telling people about
