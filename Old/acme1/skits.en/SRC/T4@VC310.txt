All for You...

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
(YUR), you're really good at cooking!

## POINTER 2
(RAP)
*Woof*

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
Yer not half bad yerself, (KAR).

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
You're pretty good at it too, 
for an old man who's always 
making excuses not to cook.

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
The ladies love a man who can cook!

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
No way... If that were true, I'd 
be the coolest guy around!

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
Seriously, it's true!

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
Even if it doesn't make me cool, 
I guess I'm happy just to have 
other people enjoy my cooking.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Yeah, it's a lot better than 
just cooking for yourself.

## POINTER 10
(RAP)
*Woof*

## POINTER 11
(RAV)
It's nice watchin' a lady enjoy a good 
meal. I could care less about guys.

## POINTER 12
(KAR)
Next time I cook for you, (RAV), all 
you're getting is a butter sandwich.

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
Nah, spreading butter is too much 
work. Just give him the crusts.

## POINTER 14
(RAV)
What happened ta being happy about 
other people enjoy yer cooking...?
