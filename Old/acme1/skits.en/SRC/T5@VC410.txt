(YUR)'s Worry

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
I guess the Empire likes to throw its 
weight around no matter where you go.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Before I left the capital, I didn't 
know--or care--about anything 
besides the lower quarter...

## POINTER 3
(RAP)
*...Whine*

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
It's not everywhere, but I feel 
like the Empire's influence is 
especially strong on Ilyccia.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
They can do whatever they want since there 
aren't any major guilds on Illycia.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
We can't just let it stay this way...

## POINTER 7
(RAP)
*Woof*
