The Guide

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Are we going to keep going, or what?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Yeah, we should. Or are we lost?

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
That's impossible. We 
have a map, right?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Well, it's useless if we can't read 
it. So, Captain, you're drawing 
the map. Which way do we go?

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Let's see, this way's north, so 
that would put us... Uh...?

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
We're here. North is the other way.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Nice! (JUD), you're amazing.

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
And the mapmaker is useless.

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Huh...? L-looks like I'm not so good at 
making maps indoors... Heh, heh heh...

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
That's not as funny as you think 
it is. Come on, let's go.
