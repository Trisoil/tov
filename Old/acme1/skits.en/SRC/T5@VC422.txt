A Town without a Barrier

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
I had no idea there were villages in 
the middle of the Sands of Kogorh.

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
I'm impressed they've managed ta live 
here without a barrier to protect 'em.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
They don't even have outer walls. Any monster 
could destroy this village easy.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
I don't feel like I could really get a good 
night's sleep in a place like this.

## POINTER 5
(RAP)
*Whine*

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
I do wonder how they handle 
the danger of wild monsters.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
I guess everyone in town 
is just really strong!

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
...Could you be any more stupid?

## POINTER 9

*Whine...*
