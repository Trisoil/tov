The Adephagos Awakens

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
...Seeing the Adephagos just there, 
in the sky... It's horrible.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
...Yeah. To think that catastrophe from the 
legend was hidden up there all along...

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
It's creepy.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
It just showed up in the sky, out of nowhere. 
All the people must be so worried...

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
I'd rather see what we're up against 
than let it grow out of control 
somewhere hidden away.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
Your spirit is amazing, 
(JUD).

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
It might be a good thing to have the danger 
right out in front of us, though.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
It'll bring together people who'd never get along otherwise.

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
True. When you can no longer deny the Adephagos 
exists, all that's left is to face it.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
You're right.
