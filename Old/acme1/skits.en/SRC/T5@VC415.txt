Leader of a Hundred Guilds

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
How many guilds are there in this city?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
I don't know the exact number, but I 
think there are more than a hundred.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Whoa, that many? Are all 
of them in the Union?

## POINTER 4
(RAP)
*Woof?!*

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Nah, not all of them, but... 
I'd guess around 90% of 
them are Union members.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Wow, and the Don's at the top of 
them all... That guy's amazing.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
That's why he's the Don!

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
What are YOU so proud about? The 
Don's the amazing one, not you.
