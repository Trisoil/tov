## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Hey, do you mind if I have a gel?

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
(KAR), I don't really think you should 
eat those unless you need them.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
But I can't stop thinking about how 
good they taste, or the smooshy 
way they feel between my teeth!

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
I noticed we've had fewer gels 
lately... You've been snacking 
on them, haven't you?

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
I want them so badly I can't sleep! 
And here you've been eating them 
while we weren't looking?!

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
I haven't been doing anything 
like that! ...Wait, (RIT), you 
were losing sleep over gels...?

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
...N-no! Of course not! Ah hah, 
wh-what are you talking about...?

## POINTER 8
(RAV)
They're not snacks, ya know. They might 
be small, but they're pretty expensive.

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
I can't say I like their taste 
or texture very much...

## POINTER 10
(JUD)
Perhaps they're not too pleasing 
to a princess's palate.

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
No, that's not it. I don't think 
they're that good either.

## POINTER 12
(KAR)
I'm addicted to their simple taste. 
You just don't get it...

## POINTER 13
(RAV)
...Gels were made sweet and soft so
they'd appeal ta children, after all.

## POINTER 14
(KAR)
...Are you saying my sense 
of taste is...childish?

## POINTER 15
(JUD)
What's the matter with that? 
You ARE both children...
