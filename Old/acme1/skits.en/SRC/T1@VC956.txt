The Blade Drifts of Zopheir

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
(KAR), just what sort of place 
is the Blade Drifts of Zopheir?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Well, I've never been there myself, but I've heard 
the entire place is covered in a sheet of ice.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Nan told me this was the best season for hunting 
monsters there, 'cause the ice is thickest.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
The monsters there sound pretty tough, too.

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Covered in a sheet of ice, huh? I'm gettin' 
the chills just hearin' about it.

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
Will it be a problem that we haven't 
made any special preparations?

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
No matter how cold it is, it'll be better than 
the heat of the Sands of Kogorh, right?

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
I dunno about better, but we're running out 
of time. We'll have to go in as we are.
