Again...?

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
*Sigh* ...Again?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
This food's a staple. But...I 
do wonder why we always have 
the same thing to eat.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
We have other recipes 
we could be making.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
(RIT) said she liked it so much 
she could eat it every day.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Hey, the old man was whining about how 
he hates every other kind of food.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
Well, (YUR) was goin' on and on about 
how we hafta save money on food!

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
(JUD_P), didn't you say this would be 
a good way to compare our cooking?

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
I thought (EST_P) was trying 
to perfect this dish...

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
...I want something else.

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
Me too!

## POINTER 11
(RAV)
Me three!

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
I'm tired of this!

## POINTER 13
(JUD)
Our other recipes are going to waste!

## POINTER 14
(EST_P)
All right, let's eat something 
different next time, okay?

## POINTER 15
(KAR)
So I wasn't the only one who 
was tired of it, after all...
