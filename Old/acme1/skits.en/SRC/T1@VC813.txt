It's So Not You

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
You know, in knight's armor, you really do look 
like a knight, (YUR). You're quite handsome!

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
You're getting a complement you 
know. It wouldn't hurt to smile.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
I'm not really crazy about this getup.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
I've got bad memories of (FRE) laughing his head 
off about how silly I looked in this...

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Well...I think I get how (FRE) felt... It's like...somebody 
dressed you up! Ah ha ha ha ha!

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
No, not at all, (YUR)!
It's good because 
it's so different from who you are.

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
Leave it to (YUR) to be different 
even in a normal suit of armor.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
This is why I hate this uniform!
