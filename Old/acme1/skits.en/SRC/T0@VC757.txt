Man...why did it have to end up like this...
They said...they said I was f-f-fired...

(KAR), keep your spirits up!

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
I can't be happy anymore... It's like 
her words are a dagger in my heart...

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
She was just worried it'd be too dangerous 
for you. There's still hope.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Huh? Y-you think so?!
...Uh, whatever, 
I don't care about what she thinks!

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
The problem is your guild, 
right? I get it.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
R-right, yeah.
I don't care about Nan...

I'm rooting for you, (KAR)!
