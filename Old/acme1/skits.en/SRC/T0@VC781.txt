The Tower of Ghasfarost

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
The bottom of the tower looked 
ancient, but the top is new...

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
It would seem someone built it onto a 
structure that was already here.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
I had no idea there were 
any towers in this area.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
I wonder when it was built?

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Well, judgin' by how new the top looks, 
I'd say it was pretty recent.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
Do you think Barbos built it?

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
The Blood Alliance is one of the bigger guilds, 
but even they couldn't build something like this.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Ragou. He must have been putting up the funds.

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Hey, yeah. That 
would make sense.

## POINTER 10

We still ain't any closer to figurin' out WHY 
they'd build somethin' like this, though...
