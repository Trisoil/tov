(YUR)
I wonder what they were thinking, 
building a big manor out in the 
middle of nowhere like this.

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
Isn't it obvious? Crooked 
plots and intrigue!

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
We should hurry and finish what
we need to do before we get
caught up in anything.

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
It's not so bad here, (EST_P). Why not 
take our time and get the full tour?

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Are you thinking of exposing 
some "crooked plots and intrigue" 
while we're here?

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
Nah, I wasn't thinkin' about any 
of that. Being in someone's home 
is just so relaxin', is all.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
I can't believe you...

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
We don't have time for this. We're 
going on ahead, old man.

## POINTER 9
