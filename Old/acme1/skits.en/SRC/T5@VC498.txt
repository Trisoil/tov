(RIT)
...Yeah, with this...I'd say the Collector's 
Book looks pretty complete to me.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
R-really?! So you mean, you're 
going to...eat your words?

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
S-sure. Good job.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Eat them.

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Uhhh... *nom nom nom*

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
Y-yes, I did it! Look, 
everyone! Look at this!

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
You wouldn't know how much was 
left if you didn't already know 
most of the items in there.

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
Ah, you caught on? Well, there were 
a few I didn't know at first, like 
the apatheia or Dein Nomos.

## POINTER 12
(YUR)
Of course I caught on. So why'd you
make (EST_P) go through all that trouble?

## POINTER 13
(RIT)
Well, I...I knew we'd eventually 
have to write it all down, but...

## POINTER 14
(RIT)
I-I didn't...uh...you know, feel like 
transferring all that data from 
my head to paper...

## POINTER 15
(RIT)
R-really! That's all it was! ...What?!

## POINTER 16
(YUR)
...Well, all she had growing up were 
books. I guess it's good she had a chance 
to get some hands-on experience.
