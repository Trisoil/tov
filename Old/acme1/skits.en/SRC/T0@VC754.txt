## POINTER 1
(KAR)
(YUR), you sure know a lot of strange people.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Like that (RAV) guy we met in Capua Nor, 
or that Zagi weirdo who attacked us.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
"Weirdo" is putting it mildly. 
What's his deal, anyway?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
That's what I'd like to know.
It's nice to have fans, but 
this is ridiculous.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
It looked like he went down with the ship, 
though... Maybe that was the last of him?

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
I don't know. Common sense just doesn't 
seem to apply to those kinds of people.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Man, I really don't want to see him again!

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Well, even if we do, he'll be gunning for (YUR), 
not us. I've got nothing to do with this.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
We'll deal with that when the time comes.
