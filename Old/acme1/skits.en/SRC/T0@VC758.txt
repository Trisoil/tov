Doesn't Seem Like an Earthquake

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Was this town really destroyed by an earthquake? 
The buildings all look kind of strange...

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Yeah. They don't really look like they collapsed 
from the ground shaking... Something's weird.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Yeah, so...how were they destroyed, then?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Got me. Maybe we can find out by asking 
someone who used to live in the town.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
That's not really why we're here 
though, so why should we care?

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
You actually have a point there.
