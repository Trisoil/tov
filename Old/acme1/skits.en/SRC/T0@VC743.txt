Man, some people have some weird hobbies.
I mean, who goes around destroying blastia?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
I wouldn't really call that a hobby.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
If we ever come across whoever's 
doing this, I'll destroy him!

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
But what if he has some reason for what he's doing?

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
They can have any reason they want, destroying 
blastia is unforgivable! Period!

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Ack, my, my neck! My neck!
Waaaaaghh! 
Ack, heeeelp meee, (YUR)!

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Meh, that'd take effort.
Just play nice with each other, kids.

## POINTER 8

(EST_P)...

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
Umm...do your best, (KAR)!
