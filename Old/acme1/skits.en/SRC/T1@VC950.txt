The Port Is So Much Better

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
Ragou's gone, the new magistrate's here... Nor 
Harbor's so much better... It's not fair.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Yeah, I'm sure (EST_P) would love to see this.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
We'd better hurry up and rescue her then, 
and bring her back here with us.

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
She did make a promise to Pauly, too.

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
And breaking that promise would go 
against the laws of Brave Vesperia.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Punish the unjust... Yeah. We'll just have 
to come back once we've saved (EST_P).
