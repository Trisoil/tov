They're Gone!

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
I never should have 
left (EST_P) alone.

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Maybe I couldn't have done anything, but I should've 
stayed with her. She was so depressed...

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
You're not responsible for this. Beating 
yourself up over it won't bring her back.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
I know...

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
And what happened to (RAV)?

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
He was acting a little strange.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Do you think they're working together?

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
I really doubt they'd both 
disappear at the same time.

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
But why just the two of them...?

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
...Don't make me start questioning 
your loyalties, (RAV)...
