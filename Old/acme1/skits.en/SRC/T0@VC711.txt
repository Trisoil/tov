You don't use magic, do you, (YUR)?

It's not that I don't. I can't.

## POINTER 3

That's one talent I don't have.

## POINTER 4

But anyone with blastia should be able to use 
magic if they just learn the theory...right?

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
I told you, I don't have the knack 
for learning magical theory!

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
So...you're bad at studying?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
That's one way to put it.
