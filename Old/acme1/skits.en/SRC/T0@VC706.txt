A map, equipment, and even money. 
Your friends are so generous, (YUR)!

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
*Sigh* They can't afford this. They 
can barely get by as it is.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
Well, I'm sure they're worried about you, 
and want you to have a safe journey.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
It's more likely they're just glad 
to be rid of a trouble-making kid.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
That's not true!

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Guess I can't come back empty-handed, now 
that they've given us all this stuff.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Now I gotta bring back the aque blastia. No matter what.
