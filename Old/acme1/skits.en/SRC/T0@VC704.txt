Are there many people outside the castle 
like that man Zagi we met earlier?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Nah, he's one of a kind. 
It's pretty hard to find 
anyone that nuts.

## POINTER 3
(EST)
I see. Well that's a relief. 
I don't know what I'd do if 
everyone behaved like that...

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Yeah, life would be pretty rough if 
the world were full of guys like him.
