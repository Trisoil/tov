(YUR)
I don't know what we'd do in this 
journey without (RAP)'s help.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
How come (RAP)'s so strong, anyway?

## POINTER 3
(RAP)
*Woof! Woof woof!*

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
He trained hard in order to 
capture the spot of Big Boss.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
What do you mean? "Capture 
the spot of Big Boss"...?

## POINTER 6
(RAP)
*Grr... Woof*

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
It was a battle to defeat the Little 
Wolves, the leaders of all the 
dogs and cats in the capital.

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
Th-they had a leader...?

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
They were the former "Big Bosses". 
They oppressed the cats and dogs, 
and even harmed humans...

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
U-umm... I'm really interested 
in hearing more, but...

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
Y-yeah... If it's a long story, maybe you 
could tell us when we have more time?

## POINTER 12
(RAP)
*Whine, woof*

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
Oh well, your loss... Long story short, 
(RAP) fought for the dogs and 
cats, and now he's their boss.

## POINTER 14
(KAR)
So he got stronger to protect 
the ones he cared about.

## POINTER 15
(EST_P)
And the reason he's fighting 
now is also to protect the people 
he cares about, right?

## POINTER 16
(RAP)
*WOOF WOOF!*
