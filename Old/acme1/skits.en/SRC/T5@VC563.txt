Oh, (EST_P), you look so cute!

## POINTER 2

R-really? I'm glad... I was worried these 
clothes wouldn't look good on me...

## POINTER 3

They seem kind of old-fashioned.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
That's what makes them cute! ...Ah, 
I wasn't talking about myself!

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
No, it's okay.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
I was just saying that the 
clothes are cute, not me...

## POINTER 7

You don't need to be so modest!
