From Mind to Game

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
...What sort of technology 
is this...?

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
I can't understand how it takes 
the image of Ba'ul from our heads 
and turns it into a game...

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Well, well. So there are things not 
even our genius mage understands!

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
You know, this whole town is full 
of stuff we don't understand.

## POINTER 5
(RAP)
*Woof*

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
So what? If it's fun, it's fun!

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
Maybe that works for happy-go-lucky 
(RAV), but I need to understand 
what's around me.

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
I think there's some truth 
in what (RAV)'s saying.

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
Even if you can't unravel certain 
mysteries, it doesn't change the 
fact that what's fun is fun.

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
Ya see! Ya see?! (JUD) darlin', 
unlike *someone* here, you 
sure know what's important.

## POINTER 11
(RAV)
You and me, we're on 
the same wavelength!

## POINTER 12
(YUR)
...I wonder what would come up 
on the screen if it showed what 
the old man was thinking?

## POINTER 13
(RAP)
*Whine...*

## POINTER 14
(RIT)
I don't even want to imagine 
it. In fact, I'm sure we couldn't 
imagine it if we tried...
