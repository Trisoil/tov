Aurnion's Spirit

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Man, Aurnion's just getting 
better and better.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Indeed. A town born from the empire 
and the guilds... I'm sure 
it'll be a wonderful city.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Though it's a shame it took a world 
crisis to get them to work together.

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Heh, a global threat brings people 
together. That's irony for you.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)

They're finally seeing eye to eye.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
Right. And even if they need 
a crisis now, I'm sure one day, 
it'll just come naturally.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Yeah.
