Heracles is Amazing!

That moving fortress that attacked that monster 
was amazing...What'd you call it? Heracles?

## POINTER 2

That was a monster, itself. I never knew  
the Imperial Knights had anything like that.

I don't know many details, but it seems 
it was constructed under Alexei's orders.

Without Heracles, we might all be in that 
flying monster's stomach about now...

Seriously. Heracles to the rescue.
