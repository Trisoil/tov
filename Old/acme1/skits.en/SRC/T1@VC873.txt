The Entelexeia, Astal

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
If we don't go after Alexei, that Entelexeia 
we saw is gonna wind up an apatheia.

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
Even from this far away, Astal's wounds looked 
terrible. He might not hold out much longer...

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
I guess not even the Entelexeia 
are a match for Heracles.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Maybe that was Alexei's reason for 
building it in the first place.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Naturally. There's no way he'd need something that 
powerful just to take care of the guilds.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Whatever the case, we have to catch Alexei and 
stop him before it's too late for Astal.
