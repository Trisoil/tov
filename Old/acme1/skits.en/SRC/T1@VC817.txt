What (FRE) Thinks

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
(FRE) was asking for (EST_P) to come back with him, right?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
The Knights can't help thinking that the 
best place for a princess is a castle.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
He's just worried that he won't 
be able to keep track of her.

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
But (EST_P) decided to set out on this journey 
on her own, and you want to respect that.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
I haven't really thought about it all that much.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
The Knights are bound to keep following you 
though, as long as (EST_P)'s with you.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
And what kind of a guild would we be if we 
didn't get into trouble with the Knights?

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
I don't think fighting with the Knights 
is actually a guild requirement...
