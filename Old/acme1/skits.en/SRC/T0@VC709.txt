On Traveling

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
I never guessed I'd leave 
home quite like this.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Are you sorry to be leaving the capital behind, (YUR)?

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
When I was in the lower quarter, I was 
too busy just living day to day.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Never really thought about it. I guess I did feel 
like setting out on an adventure sometimes.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
I'm so excited just to be outside. I've always 
dreamed of going out into the world.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Being excited and all is fine, but don't 
overdo it. We need to find (FRE), right?

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
I'm excited and worried 
all at the same time.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Heh, all right.
