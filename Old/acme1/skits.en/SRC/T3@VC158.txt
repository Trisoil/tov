(KAR)'s Bag: Part 2

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
I wonder why my bag works so well 
when I hit enemies with it...?

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Huh? You don't know how 
your own bag works?

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Yeah, not really.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
...Surely the bag just has a high 
level of aer conductance?

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Aer...conductance?

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
It's a measure of how easily 
something carries aer.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
The aer produced when you use 
strike artes must be easily 
conducted through that bag.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
So that's why enemies get weaker 
when I hit them with my bag?

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
Exactly. It's the same as with my belt.

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
Different people have different items 
that carry aer for them more easily.

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
Wow, interesting... Thanks, (RIT)!

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
You sure don't know much about 
your own possessions.

## POINTER 13
(KAR)
I guess I'd better take 
good care of my bag!
