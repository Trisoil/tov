Thinking Too Hard?

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
You know, at first I wasn't comfortable 
with fighting, but recently 
I've gotten quite used to it.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Oh yeah? Well, you have 
been fighting a lot, huh?

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
It looks like you're still 
wasting energy with some unnecessary 
movements, though.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
I always try hard to think of what 
I should do next, but somehow I 
just can't get things right...

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Maybe you're thinking too hard?

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
If you fought more on a gut level, your 
body might respond more fluidly.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
On a gut level... I see! So I just 
need to follow my instincts!

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
...You think maybe she misunderstood 
what we were saying?

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
Maybe, but I think she'll 
figure things out.
