The Flames of Battle

## POINTER 1
(JUD)
Why'd you run away, (YUR)?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
The way that fight was going, we 
would've been eaten in no time!

## POINTER 3
(RAP)
*Woof!*

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
I'll bet we could've ripped our 
way out from inside its stomach.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
This woman's crazy...

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
I dunno, I think (JUD) could pull 
it off. And that scares me.

## POINTER 7
(RAP)
*...Whine*

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
Did you really want to fight that 
monster so badly, (JUD)?

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
It's not that I wanted to fight 
it... I just don't like 
leaving things half done.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
This was a strategic retreat. 
Come on. It would've been bad 
if we'd actually been eaten.

## POINTER 11
(JUD)
Yeah... But we should 
come back here again.

## POINTER 12
(YUR)
Yeah, if we feel like it.
