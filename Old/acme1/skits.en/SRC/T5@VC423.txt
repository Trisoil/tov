A Long, Long Time Ago

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
A book in the warehouse said this 
city rose into the air at the end 
of the Geraios civilization.

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Hmm, so that would mean it was 
on land before that happened?

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
That part wasn't clear, but I 
think the city was probably floating 
on the ocean until then.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
Oh, so that's why it got eaten 
by a giant jellyfish...

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
I don't think that's quite 
what happened...
