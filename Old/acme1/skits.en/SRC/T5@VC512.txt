I love dinner cooked outside 
over a campfire! â™ª Maybe it's 
the spice of the stars...

## POINTER 2

The spice of the stars, 
huh? Heh, maybe so.

## POINTER 3

*Woof*

## POINTER 4

Nah, the food you get at an 
inn in town is way better!

The pretty young lady says somethin' 
nice, and ya gotta go kill the mood!

Food is food, no matter where 
you eat it! It's all the same 
mush in your stomach, anyway.

## POINTER 9

## POINTER 10

do have better food, and it 
doesn't matter where you eat...

Er, no, I mean, I, you see...
Well, I guess... ...Sorry.
