Is Dahngrest Okay?

## POINTER 1

The bridge collapsed from the monster's attack...
I wonder if Dahngrest is all right.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
It seems that some people were injured, too.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
The place was crawling with knights.
I think they can handle things from here.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
Plus the Don's in Dahngrest, and all 
the guild members are really tough.

## POINTER 5

(FRE) would catch us if we went back now, 
and that'd be the end of your travels.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
You're right.
I'll put my trust in the 
Imperial Knights and the guilds.

## POINTER 7

I decided I'm going with you, and 
that's what I'm going to do.
