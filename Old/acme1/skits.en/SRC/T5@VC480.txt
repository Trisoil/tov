Wishy-washy & Gloomy

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
This rain is so gloomy.

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
I wonder if it'll ever let up.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Tolbyccia is in the tropics, so it 
hardly ever stops raining here.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
You know, I read about Tolbyccia 
in a book once.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
They say that all of the rainfall 
makes for an unusually high diversity 
of plants and animals.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Who cares about that 
stuff? I'm with (RIT).

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
I was born and raised in Tolbyccia, 
so this is nothing for me.

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Ahh, okay. That makes perfect sense!

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
A place like this suits a wishy-washy, gloomy 
person like yourself pretty well.

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
Huh? Do I really seem that emo...?
