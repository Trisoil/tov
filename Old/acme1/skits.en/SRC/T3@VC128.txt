Stress Relief

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
Oh, okay, that's why...

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Yeah, don't you think?

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
What?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Doesn't it stress you out just watching 
everyone else fight all the time?

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
You sure you're not confusing 
me with yourself?

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
You don't wonder what it is about 
yourself that makes other people 
not want to rely on you?

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
Maybe that's the way YOU feel...

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
...You really do have 
it together, (RIT).

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
I get to think about things while 
you all are in battle. It's nice.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Hmmm, I guess hitting (KAR) and 
kicking the old man aren't as much 
of a stress relief as I thought.

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
What, you think stuff like 
this relieves stress?

## POINTER 12
(KAR)
Ow...! So cut it out!
