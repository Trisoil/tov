Getting Lost

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Did people really live in this 
place? I don't know where we're 
supposed to go next...

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
It's like the place is 
made to confuse us.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
It was probably built according 
to a plan at first.

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
But after all sorts of little 
improvements, it ended up being 
the tangled city that it is.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Isn't is strange that such an 
advanced civilization would 
have such haphazard planning?

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
...Maybe they were so advanced 
that the plans couldn't keep 
up with the rate of progress?

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
Perhaps they thought technology 
just a few years old was outdated, 
and changed their plans.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
There's no use making guesses 
about what happened to a lost 
civilization. Let's keep going.

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
You're not interested in figuring 
out how that lost civilization 
kept from getting lost?

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
We men will make a path!

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
That's right!

## POINTER 12
(JUD)
Oh please...

## POINTER 13
(RIT)
So go ahead. Lead the way.
