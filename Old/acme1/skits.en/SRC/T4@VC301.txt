The Secret Ingredient

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
(YUR)'s croquettes are the best!

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
How strange... They're just balls 
of mashed potatoes, but...

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
There must be a secret ingredient!

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Oh yeah? What'd ya put in it, (YUR)?

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Love.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Agh! ...*Hack* *hack* Ick, blech!

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Wh-who are you and what 
did you do with (YUR)...?

## POINTER 8
(RAV)
My hearin' isn't what it used to be. What 
did ya say the secret ingredient was?

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Love! The lady who ran the inn 
where I lived always said 
cooking was all about love.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
I put as much love in them as I could. 
So eat them with care, okay?

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
(YUR)'s love-filled croquettes...

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
Ugh...

## POINTER 13
(RAV)
I wish they weren't so good...

## POINTER 14
(JUD)
A secret ingredient is a cook's 
greatest treasure. You didn't 
want to tell them, did you?

## POINTER 15
(YUR)
Actually, I didn't put anything 
special in there at all.
