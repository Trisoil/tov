Just...Stick Them Together

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
(EST_P), that arte you just did...

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Yes, I know. I surprised myself, too.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
I just kind of stuck attack magic and support 
magic together and that came out.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
No no no. That was way more 
powerful than "just kind of 
sticking them together"!

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
R-really?

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
That just shows how strong 
(EST_P)'s grown.

## POINTER 7
(RAP)
*WOOF!*

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Well, you're definitely a lot stronger 
than when I first met you.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Keep up the good work, (EST_P).

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
Of course! You two do the same.
