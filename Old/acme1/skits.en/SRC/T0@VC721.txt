I can't wait until the tree's blossoms are 
in full bloom. They'll be fantastic...

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
I bet there's a flood of petals big enough to just sweep you away.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
All those petals dancing in the 
breeze... It'd be like a dream...

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
I wonder how they deal with all their houses 
getting buried in flowers every year.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
That's gotta be a pain to clean up.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
...You really take the fun 
out of things, (YUR).
