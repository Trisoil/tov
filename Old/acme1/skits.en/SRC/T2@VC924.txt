Ready for the Final Battle - Women

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
...Is fighting really the 
only option with Duke?

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
Well if he's in Tarqaron, 
then I think we'll have to.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
If only we can defeat the Adephagos with the 
spirits before he completes the formula...!

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
Do you think he'll just 
let that happen?

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
As long as he's sacrificing people 
to achieve his aims at Tarqaron, 
we have to stop him.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
......

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
Are you that conflicted about fighting him?

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
Yes... But we won't win 
if we go in with doubts.

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
Oh, I don't know. If doubting is 
part of your nature, you should 
trust that nature in battle.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
What?

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
Well said, (JUD). Maybe that's 
the right approach.

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
We're not your typical band 
of heroes, after all.

## POINTER 13
(JUD)
You do what you can. You take the hits. 
But you don't lose. Sound about right?

## POINTER 14
(EST_P)
(RIT)... (JUD)...

## POINTER 15
(EST_P)
Thank you.
