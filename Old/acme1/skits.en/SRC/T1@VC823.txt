(YUR)'s Hunches

## POINTER 1
(JUD)
It looked quite sinister from the outside, but 
nothing interesting has happened so far.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
...Yeah, seriously. Looks like 
all my hunches were off.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Hunches?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
I was kind of hoping for something, 
but you aren't scared at all...

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
Oh. So I should be saying things like, "Aaah! 
Save me, (YUR)!" and grabbing onto you?

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
It's no fun if you tell me up front 
you're gonna do it. Forget it.

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
That's too bad. It sounded like fun.
