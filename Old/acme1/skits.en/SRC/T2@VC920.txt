Telling of the Changing World

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
I hope everyone will accept this.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
I mean, that the world is changing.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
There's a difference between understanding something 
and accepting something. It'll take time.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
But this is the only way that's 
left. We just have to accept it.

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
This isn't a choice we've made 
freely. We had to choose it.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
But...

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
It's something we have to do. That's what you want to say, right?

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
Y-yeah.

## POINTER 9
(JUD)
That's fine, then. 
Cheer up, (KAR).

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
Okay. You think it'll work out, right?

## POINTER 11
(JUD)
Who knows?

## POINTER 12
(KAR)
...(JUD)... I can't tell 
if you're trying to make 
me feel better or not...
