Reconciling with (JUD)

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
(KAR), were you thinking by yourself this 
whole time about what to do with (JUD_P)?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Yeah, it was pretty much all I thought 
about after we left Nordopolica.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
That...and about what you 
did to Ragou and Cumore.

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
Really? It's nice to hear you thought about 
me that much, even when I wasn't around.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Yeah... I wasn't sure at first. 
What was right, what was wrong...

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
I think I have the Don to thank for setting me straight.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Without the Don's last words, I never would 
have found answers to the questions I had.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
"You gotta stand on your own two feet."

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Yeah, I was thinking about what that meant.

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
And before I knew it, I wasn't thinking about what 
was right. I was thinking about what I want to do...

## POINTER 11
(JUD)
And that helped you decide what to do with the guild.

## POINTER 12
(KAR)
Yeah. So here's 
to fresh starts!

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
Yeah.

## POINTER 14
(JUD)
To fresh starts.
