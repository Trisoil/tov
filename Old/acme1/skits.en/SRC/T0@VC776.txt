The Conspiracy and (FRE)'s Trouble

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
I cannot believe that Ioder would
give a letter like that to (FRE).

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
There must be some mistake!

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
We've met His Highness, too, and he certainly 
didn't seem like that kind of person.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
But you heard the letter--it said to take 
Don Whitehorse out of the picture!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
So maybe it was sent by someone who wants to throw 
a wrench into what Ioder and (FRE) are doing.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
But that's nothing more than a hunch right now.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Yeah, you're right. The only thing we know for 
sure right now is that (FRE) is in trouble.
