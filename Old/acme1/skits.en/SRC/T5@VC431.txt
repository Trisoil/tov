Something's Not Right

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
This may be a silly question,
but what exactly is this town?

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Yeah... Writing I've never seen 
before, strange buildings... 
Something's not right here...

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
I've traveled all over with 
Ba'ul, but I've never seen 
a place like this before.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Maybe it's related to some 
sort of guild activities?

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
I dunno... I've never heard 
of a guild like this.

## POINTER 6

Well, so what? There's nothin' 
better than a mysterious town 
every once in a while!
