No Mercy!

## POINTER 1
(JUD)
That last battle went by in the blink 
of an eye. You guys are merciless!

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Hit before the enemy has a chance 
to. The only certain victory 
is a preemptive one.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
We can't show our enemies any mercy!

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
If we take it too easy, then we're 
just playin' with 'em. Makes me 
feel sorta bad fer 'em, ya know?

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
But still, I think a little bit of mercy 
would have been okay, just to be fair.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
You're prolly the most 
cold-blooded, merciless killer 
of us all, (JUD) darlin'.

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
Oh? You really think that?!

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Looks like she doesn't 
even realize it.

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
I think she's just pretending not to.
