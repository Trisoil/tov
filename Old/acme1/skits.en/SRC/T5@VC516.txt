All Corners of the World

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
We finally filled in the world 
map! It was practically blank 
when we left the lower quarter.

## POINTER 2
(RAP)
*Woof*

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
In the castle, I never could've 
imagined that I'd travel to all 
the corners of the world someday.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
It's such a huge world we live 
in. Filling in this map really 
helped me realize that.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Anyone can read about these places
in books, but to actually feel
the heat or the cold is...wow...

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Yeah. The only way to learn about 
this world is to get out there 
and experience it for yourself.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Seeing is believing, they say.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Well, it shows you that you 
can't just rely on books to 
learn what you need to know.

## POINTER 9
(RAP)
*Woof!*

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
Yeah yeah, learn learn.

## POINTER 12

Urgh, you're just impossible!
