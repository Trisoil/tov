Come On! Say It!

## POINTER 1
(JUD)
*Sigh*...

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Hey, (YUR), something's 
weird about (JUD).

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
(JUD_P)'s always weird.

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
You're terrible... Can't you 
see how stressed I am?

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
What's the matter? 
Did something happen?

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
I'm just...I'm just not 
helpful at all, am I...?

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
That's not true! Why 
would you say that?

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
No, you don't have to pretend. 
I'm too weak, I know it.

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
You...weak?! Trust me, nobody 
thinks that at all!

## POINTER 10
(JUD)
No, it's all right. Don't try to make 
me feel better. It's easier for me 
this way, anyway.

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
...You're bored, aren't you? 
Not being able to fight...?

## POINTER 12
(JUD)
Oh...

## POINTER 13
(KAR)
...Is that what you're worried about?

## POINTER 14
(JUD)
No, it's okay. I can handle the boredom... 
Besides, I have Ba'ul to talk to.

## POINTER 15
(YUR)
*Sigh*
