Traveling with This Bunch?

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
When we left the capital, it was 
just me, (RAP) and (EST_P).

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Now (KAR) and (RIT) have joined 
us. I'm so happy to have more 
people to travel with!

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
I'm not so sure about some people 
in our party, though.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
I'm not so sure about you, you little runt.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Hey now, go easy on the young Captain.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
(RIT), we all have to work to get along, okay?

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
Oh, yeah... Right.
