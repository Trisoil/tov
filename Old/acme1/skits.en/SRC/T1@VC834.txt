Things Get Complicated

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
And here I thought all we'd be doing 
at the coliseum was beating bad guys.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Now things have gone and gotten complicated.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
I certainly didn't think we'd be seeing (FRE) here.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
Not to mention that Zagi guy.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
And that runaway coward, Regaey, too. It can't be 
a coincidence. Not with them all here at once.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
If it is a coincidence, it's the worst one I've 
ever heard of. Just how bad can our luck be?

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
Ya think Leviathan's Claw are the 
ones callin' the shots this time?

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
Thinking things through is all well and good, 
but we don't want Regaey skipping out on us.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
No kidding. We'll finish talking later. Let's go.

## POINTER 10
(RAP)
Woof!
