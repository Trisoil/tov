Zagi - Part 2

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
Zagi was about as annoying 
as they come, but I feel 
sort of sorry for him.

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
Oh? That's surprising. I thought 
he was a "Humph. Idiot!" kind 
of person.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
That is NOT what I sound like!

## POINTER 4
(JUD)
I stand corrected.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
...When you can do something better than anyone else, 
you wind up feeling like something's missing.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
The other researchers would go on 
and on about something I'd discovered, 
like, two months before...

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
And I'd start to feel like talking 
with them was pointless.

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
So you think...Zagi was the same way?

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
I just got the feeling that we might have 
had something in common, that's all.

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
...But why am I telling 
you this? Just forget it.

## POINTER 11
(JUD)
I'm sorry, but I have a good memory.

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
Well then, keep it a secret, all right?

## POINTER 13
(JUD)
Heh heh, it's a deal.
