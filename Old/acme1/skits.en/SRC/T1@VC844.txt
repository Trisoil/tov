The Clear Ciel Crystal

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Can a clear ciel crystal really 
be used to make a barrier?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
If they could, and we had enough, we'd be 
able to make as many barriers as we wanted.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
Then even areas that suffer frequent monster 
attacks could be assured safety.

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Yeah, but if it were possible, wouldn't 
something like that have happened by now?

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Maybe it's best not to get our hopes up about it, then.

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
Ever the realist, I see.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
All I'm doing is speculating on the most probable outcome.

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
Actually, I think that's what being a realist means.
