Leviathan's Claw

(KAR)
What's Yeager thinking? It's 
almost like he's trying to help us.

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
Well, he said himself that he didn't want 
the empire becoming too powerful.

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
Then maybe it's safe ta take him at his word.

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
He lays that whole nut job act on pretty thick, 
but he is in the business of sellin' weapons.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
And if the empire was on top, and 
the world was at peace, well, 
nobody would need any weapons.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
That would make sense.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
So, he's trying to drag the fighting out as long 
as he can. And that's no good for anybody.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
I...I won't let him get away with it!

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
...Yeah.
