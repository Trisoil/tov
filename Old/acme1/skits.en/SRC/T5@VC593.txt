The Mystery of the Wonder Chef

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
I probably should've asked this 
a long time ago, but who IS 
the Wonder Chef, anyway?

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Is he even human?

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
I've never read any sort of literature 
mentioning the Wonder Chef before.

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
I wouldn't mind if he taught me how 
to turn into objects like he does.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Really? But you wouldn't 
be able to move!

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
You can see all sortsa things! 
I'd transform into something 
in a pretty lady's room...

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
Ha!

## POINTER 8
(RAV)
Ugh!

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
He was waiting like that the entire 
time. What if we never found him?

## POINTER 10
(JUD)
Or what would happen if 
someone broke him...

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
You...you can't do that! What 
if he really is a person?!

## POINTER 12
(KAR)
Maybe we could just draw some 
funny pictures on him?

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
Now you're thinking.
