Alexei

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
I'm glad that Commandant Alexei 
turned out to be so reasonable.

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Yeah, I thought he'd be more 
of a stubborn jerk myself.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
Had you met him before, (YUR)?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
I knew him, but I 
doubt he knew me.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
I was barely in the Knights 
for any time at all, really.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
What sort of person is he, I wonder?

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
He can be very formal at times. But in a way, 
he's something of a symbol for the Knights.

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
Many who are in the Knights now were 
inspired to join by Alexei's example.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Heh. One thing's clear. I don't 
have much in common with him.
