All Four Spirits

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Undine, Efreet, Gnome, Sylph... The spirits 
of the four great elements have been born!

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
The Entelexeia were thinking 
of the planet after all.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
I was worried there for a little 
bit, but that wasn't too bad.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
You call surviving by the skin 
of our teeth not too bad?

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Ha!

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Ow!

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
A-anyway, we can defeat the Adephagos 
for sure now, right?

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Not yet. There are still too 
many unknown variables.

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
Hypothesize, test, evaluate, then prove... We have 
to follow the proper steps to ensure success.

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
I'm not even sure how effective the four elements 
will be in converting aer to mana, yet.

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
Wait... Could the mana from the loss in materialized aer 
created by the spirits be maintaining the balance...?

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
If so, then I shouldn't be measuring the actual value, but...

## POINTER 13
(RIT)
No, that's not right... I mean...

## POINTER 14
(KAR)
Okay... She's gone...

## POINTER 15
(EST_P)
Yep. I'd say there's nothing to worry about.â™ª
