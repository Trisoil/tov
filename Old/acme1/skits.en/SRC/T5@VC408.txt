Origin of the Academic City

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Aspio was originally built in order to 
research the giant blastia excavated 
from the mountain here, wasn't it?

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Right. At first it was just a small research 
outpost, but as more people came here 
it turned into a full-fledged city.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Now there are people in Aspio doing 
research on all sorts of topics, 
not just the giant blastia.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
And you're one of those 
new researchers, right?

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Yep, and proud of it!
