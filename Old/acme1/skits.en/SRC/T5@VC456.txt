A Sentimental Landscape

## POINTER 1
(RAV)
The hole in this mountain is
like the hole in my heart...
Ahh... How my chest aches...

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Getting all sentimental on us, Old Man?

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
Nah, it's just memories of the 
war. I'd appreciate it if we didn't 
spend too much time here.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Stop being such a coward.

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Ohh, that hurts, (RIT).

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
The only way to get past a bad 
memory is to embrace it.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Sounds like you're speaking 
from experience.

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Not really. I was just generalizing. 
Anyway, you want to hurry, 
right? Then let's go.

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
Our little genius mage is 
more mature than she looks.
