(EST_P), the Princess

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
I was so surprised to find out 
that (EST_P) was a princess!

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
I had a feeling. She knew (FRE), and she 
was obviously brought up as a noble...

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Shut up. You knew, already.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Maybe...

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Oh man... I wonder if I was rude 
to her without realizing it?

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Your language has been unpardonable. Captain (KAR), 
the sentence for insulting royalty is...decapitation.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Been nice knowing you.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
What about you?! You're way more rude than I am!

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Guess it's off with both our heads, then.

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
What?! Th-that's...

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
Idiots...
