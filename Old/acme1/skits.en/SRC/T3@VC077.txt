A Genius Mage's Change of Heart

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
Well, that's done.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
You're so nonchalant... Shouldn't 
you be a little happier?

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Nah, that was too easy.

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Act tough all ya want, but it 
looked like ya were havin' a 
pretty rough time out there.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Maybe you're starting to get 
cataracts, old man. Perhaps I 
can help you blast them out!

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
Agh! No no no no!

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
But you won! That's great! You could 
at least be a little bit happier...

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
So what, I won. It doesn't 
change anything, really.

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
But they give out a prize specially 
tailored ta the winner.

## POINTER 10
(KAR)
That's right.

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
Oh...

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
Maybe if I'd won more battles, 
they would've given me something 
useful for my research...

## POINTER 13
(RIT)
Guess I should've beaten 
more opponents...

## POINTER 14
(RAV)
Ya already won the whole tournament... 
I donâ€™t think ya could've beaten 
it any more than ya did...
