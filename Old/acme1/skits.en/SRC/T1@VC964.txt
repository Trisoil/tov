Gusios' Crystals

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
So Erealumen is something 
Gusios created.

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Right. I remember seeing a similar 
crystal back at Caer Bocram.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Yeah, you were pretty absorbed in that thing.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
The (RIT) radar never lets any objects 
of interest go undetected.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
...Oh...I forgot... If Gusios undergoes spirit conversion, 
I won't be able to investigate him...!

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
There goes the (RIT) radar.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Don't get carried away, now.
