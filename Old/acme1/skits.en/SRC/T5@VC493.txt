The Monster Book is Mine

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
You've filled up quite a bit 
of that Monster Book, (KAR)!

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
We still have half of it to go, 
but it's filling up nicely.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
You've been pretty diligent filling 
it in. I thought you never 
stuck to anything at all.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
O-oh yeah... Ah hah hah...

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
He probably had to stick with it since he 
showed it to just about everybody.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
N-no, it's not like that!

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
Oh, it isn't? Well, then, as 
long as you've made it halfway, 
let's see you finish it up.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
Of course I will!

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
All right. Good luck.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
If you get tired of it, I'd 
be happy to carry on from 
where you left off, (KAR).

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
I imagine you'd enjoy it, too, huh?

## POINTER 12
(EST_P)
Hee hee...

## POINTER 13
(KAR)
I want to finish this myself, 
so I'll keep at it!
