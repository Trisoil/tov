Who the hell decided to pan-fry noodles 
in the middle of a searing hot desert?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
People should really give more 
thought to these decisions...

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Yeah. And it's not just hot--this 
strong taste really dries 
out your throat, too!

the weaker I get...

## POINTER 6

## POINTER 11
(RAV)
So did ya make 'em yerself? Did ya 
ask someone else ta do it? Hmm?

## POINTER 12

aren't good for eating in the desert.
