The Broken Sword

(KAR), are you okay...e-even
though your sword's still broken?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Nah, it's lighter and 
feels easier to use!

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Now your sword won't be swinging 
you anymore. Sounds good to me.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Breaking your sword to get it to just the right
length... You're obviously some guild's ace!

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
...(YUR), you didn't break (KAR)'s 
sword on purpose, did you?

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
I'm not that good.
