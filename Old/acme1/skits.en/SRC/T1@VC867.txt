The Kritya

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
So...is Myorzo here?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
I wonder.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
I get the feeling it won't 
be easy to find.

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Nobody we talked to had even heard 
of a town called Myorzo.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
You'd expect to see more activity in this place 
if anybody knew there was a town here.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
The difficulty of the road might 
be responsible for that, though.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Man... Why'd the Krityans have to go and build 
a town in a place like this, anyway?

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Probably to avoid a lot of prying eyes.

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
We're just gonna have ta check it out 
for ourselves ta make sure, then.
