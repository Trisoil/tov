The Meaning of Monsters

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
We sure have fought a lot of monsters.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Yes, I thought by now they might 
be more scarce, but...

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Heh heh... That sounds like something 
you'd think, (EST_P).

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
If we could wipe out all the monsters 
ourselves, we wouldn't need anything 
like barriers anymore.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
But why are there monsters, anyway...?

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
So that people can defeat 
them, of course!

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
I think that's a little extreme...

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Well that's the only thing 
they're good for.

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
I wonder...

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
It seems there would be some 
good reason why they exist...

## POINTER 11
(RAV)
There's no use thinkin' 
too hard about it.

## POINTER 12
(RAV)
Get started on that train of 
thought, and you'll soon be askin' 
yerself why humans exist.

## POINTER 13
(EST_P)
Yes... That's a good question, too...

## POINTER 14
(YUR)
There you go. Making things 
more complicated old man.

## POINTER 15
(RAV)
I was tryin' ta get ya ta stop 
thinkin' about these things, 
not think about 'em more...
