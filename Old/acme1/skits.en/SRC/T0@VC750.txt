Hey (RIT), what did (FRE) mean about search 
and seizure rights to blastia laboratories?

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Oh, that.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Basically, if you're on an official imperial blastia 
investigation, you can go anywhere you want.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Are you serious?!

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Why bust our butts when the Knights can do that?

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
I don't think they can. There are plenty of 
"exceptions" that can block their authority.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
That sounds like what I've come to expect from the empire.
