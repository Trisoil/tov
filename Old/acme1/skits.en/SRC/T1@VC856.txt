(YUR)
The town's quiet now, but 
it could get ugly quick.

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Yeah, well. We've seen our fair share of ugliness.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Not like this, we haven't.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Do you think Palestralle is just going 
to take Belius' death lying down?

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
...The Don's grandson is wrapped up in this too. 
I guess they can't just let things slide.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
The guilds sure make a big deal about 
their rules and settling their scores.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Exactly.

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
What a pain. I don't 
get it at all.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
We're kinda caught up in this 
ourselves, you know. Just 
be ready if things go bad.

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
I know.
