Do you know how Halure's 
tree got its name?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Huh? There's a reason for that?

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
Yes. It comes from the three types 
of plants growing on the tree.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
Those plants are the harmonea, the 
luluria, and the renen. The beginnings 
of their names make "Halure".
