Opinions on (FRE)

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
I don't usually get along with knights, 
but (FRE) was different.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
He seemed like a serious, capable sort of guy, you know?

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Really? He seemed like a really stubborn, 
by-the-rules kind of guy to me.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
(FRE)'s a good person who'll give anyone 
a helping hand when they have a problem!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Maybe now, but he raised some hell in 
the lower quarter back in the day.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
I can hardly imagine 
(FRE) like that...
