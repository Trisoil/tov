Quite a Scene

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
We made quite a scene, didn't we?
I was so worried once those 
knights noticed us...

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
I told you we couldn't stand out.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
You were the one who just jumped.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
I can't just look away when monsters are attacking 
someone right in front of me, right?

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Heh heh.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
What's so funny?

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
I'm sorry.
That sounded just like the way 
(FRE) described you, that's all.

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
He often said that you could never turn a blind 
eye when someone near you was suffering.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Well, next time you see him, you tell him 
that I said he's the same way.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
Heh heh. I'll do that.
