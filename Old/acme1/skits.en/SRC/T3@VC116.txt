Ahh, Youth!

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Doesn't all that fighting 
ever make you tired, (YUR)?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Nah! I've got you here to heal 
me if I get hurt, after all.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
But...getting hurt and getting 
tired are different... Don't 
you ever run out of energy?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Mmm... I'd say swinging my 
sword gives me more energy, 
rather than taking it away.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
You're like an overenergetic kid who 
runs around until he passes out!

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Course, I've got more energy than a kid, 
so I can make that much more mischief.

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
Ah, youth! I'm outta breath with 
just one swing. I wish I could 
go back ta my younger days...

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Talk about pathetic.

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
Don't worry, it won't be long before yer 
in the same boat as me, kid! Ha ha ha!

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
I don't think that's too funny, old man.

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
Well, until then, you can just 
sit and suffer in admiration 
of my youthful energy!

## POINTER 12
(EST_P)
That's the first time I've ever heard 
of someone suffering in admiration...
