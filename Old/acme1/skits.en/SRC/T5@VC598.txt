On Stage

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
(RIT), you were resisting at first, but you 
really got into the act, didn't you?

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
N-no, you were just taking your 
part so seriously... I had no 
choice but to follow along.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Your costume was pretty cute, too. 
What a nice treat for all of us!

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Hey!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Your acting was really on point, (KAR).

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Heh. Well, I used to be in the 
actors' guild, after all...

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
You've been in all sorts 
of guilds, kid...

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Anyway, that wasn't even acting.

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
I'd like to act in another play 
with everyone else, someday.

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
No way! Never again!

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
Me neither! I don't want (RIT) 
to set me on fire again!

## POINTER 12
(JUD)
I'd like to be in the play, next time.

## POINTER 13
(RAV)
I'd have to be the lead, of course.

## POINTER 14
(YUR)
I had my doubts, but it looks 
like everyone had a good time.
