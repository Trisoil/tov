## POINTER 1
(RIT)
How long do you plan on goofing 
around on the ocean?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
What's the rush? I think it's nice to 
take things easy every once in a while.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Yeah, me too. It's a little slow, but 
it's so nice sailing on the ocean.

## POINTER 4
(RAP)
*Woof*

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Arrr, so ye three scurvy 
dogs are on my side.

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
So, shall the women take them on?

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
It's a stupid argument. Do what you want. 
We're going below deck.

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
Wait, I'm...

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
Arr, this vessel now belongs 
ta Cap'n (RAV)! Come on, men! 
We set sail fer adventure!

## POINTER 10

## POINTER 11

*Whine...*

## POINTER 12
(YUR)
I actually like the old man's 
passion... Just don't forget 
where we're going, okay?
