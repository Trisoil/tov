If the Prince Becomes Emperor

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
I wonder if the world will benefit 
if Prince Ioder becomes emperor.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Who knows...

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
What kind of weak answer is that? I thought 
you'd be at least a little optimistic.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Well, he'll have (FRE) around. That 
should help things a little.

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
But only a little?

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
I'm not so wide-eyed and innocent to think that 
major change is going to happen over night.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
That sounds like you, all right.
