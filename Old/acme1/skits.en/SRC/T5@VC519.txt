A Change of Pace

## POINTER 1
(RAV)
You sure do like walking 
around outdoors.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Who are you talking to?

## POINTER 3
(RAP)
*Whine...?*

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Just...myself.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Going senile now, huh?

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
We've just been wandering around 
outside for quite a while now.

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
It might be a nice change of pace sometimes 
to collect materials for synthesis.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
And we have Ba'ul, too. We could 
use him to fly around and 
collect them a lot faster!

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
You're saying we should 
get help from Ba'ul?

## POINTER 10
(JUD)
Yeah, I think that Ba'ul probably 
wants to help all of us 
with what we're doing.

## POINTER 11
(RAV)
Of course, it's your call whether 
to collect materials for synthesis 
or just wander around.

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
Seriously, who are you talking to?

## POINTER 13
(RAP)
*Whine...?*
