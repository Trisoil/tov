(KAR)

in a while, too, okay?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Really, (KAR)? You want 
to fight that badly?

## POINTER 3

Brave Vesperia...!

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
There's more that you can do fer the 
guild than just fightin', ya know.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
...That's a pretty surprising bit 
of wisdom coming from you, old man.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
But...what should I do, then?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Hmm... You could cook food for 
us, or gather information 
about places we're going...

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
You're good at those kinds 
of things, right?

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Oh yeah...

## POINTER 10

And yer really good at findin' cute girls 
fer me ta talk ta, right?

## POINTER 11

...Hold on. (KAR), have you really 
been doing that for the old man?

## POINTER 12
(KAR)
Uh...yeah... I mean, (RAV) told me 
to bring cute girls to him, so...

## POINTER 13
(RAV)
This kid's such a cutie, the 
ladies are all over him! âˆ€

## POINTER 14
(YUR)
...(KAR), you shouldn't be so trusting.

## POINTER 15
(RAV)
Huh, why's that?

## POINTER 16
(KAR)
Trusting of what?

## POINTER 17
(YUR)
*Sigh* Never mind...
