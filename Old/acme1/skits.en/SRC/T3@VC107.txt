A Weirdo among Weirdoes

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Your spear fighting is fluid and 
your footwork is amazing! I love 
watching you fight, (JUD).

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
Oh, it's my pleasure!

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Aren't all Krityans more of the 
nerdy, scholarly type? More 
indoors than outdoors people?

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
(YUR)'s anti-book comments aside, 
is it true that the Kritya 
don't fight in battles?

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
It seems most of us don't 
like fighting very much.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
So you're an exception?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
A weirdo among weirdos, then.

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
How strange. I've always thought 
it was normal to fight someone 
who was threatening you.

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Yeah, true.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
Really? Is that normal?

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
Sure, it's normal.

## POINTER 12
(JUD)
Totally normal.

## POINTER 13
(EST_P)
I-I see...
