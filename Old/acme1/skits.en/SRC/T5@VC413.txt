## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
There was a huge waterfall at one 
end of town! Did you see it, (YUR)?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
It was magnificent, powerful, and 
really quite beautiful... I could 
almost see a rainbow over it!

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Yeah, I saw it. It could come in handy 
having all that fresh water nearby.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
You might not even need an aque 
blastia with something like that.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
(EST_P) saw the waterfall as 
something pretty, but (YUR) saw 
it as something useful...

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
That's different standards 
of livin' for ya.
