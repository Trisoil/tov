The City of Guilds, Dahngrest

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Dahngrest has a very different atmosphere 
from the capital, doesn't it?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
The city seems so energetic. Everyone 
here is so full of life!

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Of course! It's the largest guild city. Everyone 
lives according to their own principles.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
Do you like Dahngrest, (EST_P)?

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Yes, I think it's lovely.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
What about you, (YUR)?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Mm? I think it'd be a really great city 
if the barrier wasn't crapping out.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
(YUR), will you please let that go?

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
I'm kidding! The city's not bad at all. It 
even feels kind of like the lower quarter.
