(EST_P), the Historian

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Wow... These buildings are from 
the late Ellicasm civilization! 
It must be a very old town.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
You seem to know a lot about 
these things...as always.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
It's such a shame they just let 
the city fall apart like this...

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Do you really think we're in 
any position to be sightseeing 
around this moldy old city?

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
We do have things we 
need to be doing...

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Then shouldn't we be focusing on 
them instead of this little tour?

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Oh wow... That round roof is using 
the Lian method, first developed 
by Emperor Heliorus IV!

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
But I guess we should do something 
about that first...

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Yeah.
