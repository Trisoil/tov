One Surprise after Another

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Brave Vesperia is making 
smooth sailing! â™ª

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
But I'm not sure if I can see 
which way we're heading.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
...You mean it's like we're surrounded 
by fog on all sides...?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
I kind of like that, though. You never 
know what's going to happen next.

## POINTER 5
(RAP)
*WOOF WOOF*

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
It's more like we lack a 
plan in the first place.

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
But that can be fun too! We might 
run across an amazing treasure, 
or something even better!

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Haha, you sure have a lot of enthusiasm 
for someone who gets startled 
so easily, Captain (KAR)!

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
I-I like being startled! What's the point 
of an adventure without surprises?

## POINTER 10
(JUD)
Heh, I like that. Okay, let's 
just keep moving forward as 
we have been. As a guild.

*Woof!*
