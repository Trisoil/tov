Big Game in a Small Package

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Isn't it hard to use a
weapon that large, (KAR)?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
It's a little heavy, but I need 
to hold something large like this 
to make myself look bigger.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
That's just the right trick to hide 
your miniscule size.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Ah, you want to look bigger 
to fool the enemies.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Now that you mention it, small 
monsters often puff themselves 
up to appear more menacing.

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Right, it's just like...huh? Are you 
saying I'm the same as a monster?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Even so, changing your appearance doesn't 
change who you really are, (KAR).

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
Are you dangerous? Tell 
us right now if you are!

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
It's okay! I'm an elite Hunting Blade! 
There's nothing to worry about!

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
...I hope that's not another 
one of your clever tricks.
