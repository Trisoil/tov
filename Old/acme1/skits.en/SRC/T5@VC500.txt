The Romance of the Sea

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
I've been wondering... If Ba'ul 
can fly, why do we bother 
taking a boat over the sea?

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
I love boats! A ship cutting 
through crystal-clear waters... 
Nothin's more romantic.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
Romantic? Whatever. I'd rather have 
efficiency than romance any day.

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
(RIT). I thought you of all people 
would understand. I mean, your relationship 
with blastia an' all.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Don't confuse my sincere appreciation 
for sublime beauty with your 
absurd "romance", old man.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
Oh, so cold...

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
Emotion doesn't matter. I'll choose the 
logical, pragmatic approach anytime.
