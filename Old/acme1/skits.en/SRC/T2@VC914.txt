## POINTER 1
(YUR)
......

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Are you angry, (YUR)?

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
...Yeah. A little.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
Is it about the events of Duke's 
past that Sylph shared with us?

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
...So basically, Duke's doing what he's doing 
to clean up the mess made by an idiot.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
The whole thing is just so stupid.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Even though Duke and Elucifur 
were both fighting for humanity's 
sake... It's so sad...

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Like the hero who shined so bright that people 
couldn't look at him, and got scared.

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
...The overwhelming power 
caused people to fear him.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
It's all so stupid...
