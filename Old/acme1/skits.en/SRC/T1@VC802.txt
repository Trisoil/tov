That huge flying monster actually talked, right...? 
You ever heard of a monster like that?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
I've never seen or heard of anything like that. 
I don't think anybody in the Hunting Blades has.

Man, first that thing in Caer Bocram, and now 
this. The world's just full of surprises...

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
I don't care how many lives you have... It 
wouldn't be enough to fight that thing.

Y-yeah. Not even I feel like taking 
on a monster like that.
