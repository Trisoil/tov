Outside the Barrier

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
I've heard stories about monsters 
living outside the barrier, 
but it's really true!

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Yeah.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
Now I understand why everyone says the 
world outside the barrier is so dangerous.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
It's pretty easy to forget the monsters are 
even out here, when you live on the inside.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
We'd better not let our guard down.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
Right.

## POINTER 7
(RAP)
Woof!
