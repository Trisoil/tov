Duke

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Duke certainly has an air of mystery about him.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
I thought he was pretty cold. Would it have 
killed him to listen to us a little?

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Maybe he was caught off guard. We did 
just kind of show up out of nowhere.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Did one of us say anything rude to him?

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Probably you, (RIT)...

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Ha!

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
Ow! 
Hey, no hitting!

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
I wonder if he's always 
lived here in Yormgen.

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
Who knows. I didn't get the feelin' 
he'd been here all that long, though.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Duke is pretty weird, but this whole 
town is pretty weird, too.

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
Yeah, no kidding.
