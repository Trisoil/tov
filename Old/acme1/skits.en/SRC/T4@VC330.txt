Not Too Sharp...

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Ugh... This is terrible.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Did you follow the recipe? There 
are ingredients in this food that 
really shouldn't be in it.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
Actually, I haven't seen our recipe 
book around recently...

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Yeah, I wonder where it went.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Recipe book...? Is this 
it, by any chance?

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
(RIT), you had it?

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
No wonder it seemed so flimsy and weak.

## POINTER 8
(KAR)
You were using it as a weapon...?

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
Someone replaced my book with this 
thing. It's not my fault nobody 
noticed the recipes were gone.

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Well, I can't argue with you there.

## POINTER 11
(JUD)
We don't have very many recipes, 
either... Maybe we should have 
some more interest in cooking.
