An Unforgettable Journey

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
The imperial family and the guilds... 
(EST_P)'s standing with both 
of them is gonna change.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
I don't know what'll happen 
in the future. If (EST_P) 
doesn't change that much...

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
I doubt I'll change as long as I keep 
the memories I have right now.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
But I'd like to continue this journey 
with you until the end...

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
Don't worry--I can just sneak 
you out of the castle again, 
like I did when we first met!

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
Yeah, and this time I'll tag along 
and help with the lockpicking!

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Thank you, both of you.

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
But crime is a very bad thing!

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Then we'll have to go in through 
the front like decent visitors, 
won't we, (YUR)?

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
The front door really isn't my style. 
...Man, do we really have to do that?

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
Yes, please do!
