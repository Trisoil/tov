It Ate the Aer!

## POINTER 1
(RIT)
A monster that consumes aer...?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
Just what was that creature?

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
It did seem different from other monsters somehow.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
...Yeah, that's for sure.
It also looked like it was staring at us.

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Maybe it was wonderin' which one of us to eat first.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
...I-it looked into my eyes for 
quite a long time, actually...

## POINTER 7
(JUD)
How nice for you.
He must have thought 
you looked the tastiest.

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
I don't think I'd call that nice...
