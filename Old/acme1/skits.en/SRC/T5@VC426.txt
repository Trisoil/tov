The Dawn of a New Town

## POINTER 1

There's no place to sleep! 
How inconvenient...

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
And there's no barrier either...

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Well, people are pretty tough. 
They should manage as long 
as monsters don't attack.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
Maybe you're right...

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Course he's right. Everyone'll 
have their dream home built 
in no time. You'll see.

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
Even without a barrier, I'm sure they 
can fend off monsters with the 
knights and everyone banding together.

## POINTER 7

So this is what the birth of a town 
looks like. ...How exciting!
