(EST_P), what are you looking at?

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
It's a map of the area around here.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Ooh, let me see...
Hey, this is almost completely blank!

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
You can't call this a map!

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
Really?

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
You should try a surveyors' guild, like the "World's 
Cellar"! Their maps are really amazing!

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
All the top guild members have one.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
So then, naturally you've got a 
copy, right, (KAR)? Let's see it!

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Uhhh, well, y'see... Once you get as good as 
I am, you don't need to use a map anymore!

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
Oh, that's too bad.
I really wanted to see it.
