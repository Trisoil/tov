The Dragon Rider Rides Again

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
I never thought we would meet the 
dragon rider in Ragou's palace!

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
That was a dragon? I'd never seen 
a monster like that before.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
Yes. It had a very different feeling 
to it than any monster I'd ever seen.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
I wonder where it flew away to after that.

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
I'll bet it has a hideout somewhere, but we 
don't have enough information to find it.

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Enough! Enough with that dragon freak! Just 
thinking about that jerk makes me furious!
