The Light at the End of the Tunnel

## POINTER 1
(RAV)
Y'know, we're up to our eyeballs in problems.

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
Savin' the world sure keeps a guy busy.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Well, the problems we're dealing 
with are a lot bigger 
than they used to be...

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
What... Why's everybody looking at 
me...? I got something on my face?

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Problems like you, (YUR). A lot.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
I hear that. Fate is definitely 
out to get you.

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Hmm... After everything that's happened, 
I'm starting to wonder myself.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
But hey, I've done a pretty good job of getting 
us out of whatever mess we're in, right?

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
You gotta at least give me some credit there.

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
See, for (YUR), the end of the world's just 
one more problem that needs solvin'.

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
Maybe that attitude's what's 
kept us seeing the light at 
the end of the tunnel.

## POINTER 12
(RAV)
Gotta love the power of positive thinkin'...
