Hey, (RIT). Take a look at this.

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
Huh? Oh, the Collector's 
Book. Let's see...

## POINTER 3

......

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Hmmm... You've done well to get 
this much. You even got the little 
differences between weapons...

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
I...I did it!! Well, (RIT), are 
you going to do it? Are you 
going to eat your words?

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
Err...you know that's just a figure 
of speech, right? And besides...

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
Besides?

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
You've done extremely well, but 
you still have some left to go.

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
I can still think of a few 
items that aren't in here.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
R-really...? If there are more 
items you know about, please, 
feel free to write them in!

## POINTER 11
(RIT)
You idiot. It's for your own 
good. Besides, there's only 
a little left. Keep it up!

## POINTER 12
(EST_P)
Urgh... O-okay... I'll do my best...!

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
...Is this really for 
(EST_P)'s own good?
