A Little Freaked Out

## POINTER 1

I thought you were done for when the 
ship sank with you still on it.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Seriously, I was pretty worried there 
for a minute. I'm glad you made it.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
It sank faster than I thought it would.
I was a little freaked out myself.

You almost died and you were 
just a little freaked out? There's 
something wrong with you.
