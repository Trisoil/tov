Closing Everything Off

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Only the empire has enough power to cut off 
all the ways in and out of a whole town.

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
Well, the guilds' power is totally different. 
The Union would never try something like this.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
It's the empire's style. Crush problems with 
everything they've got. What are they after?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Who do they think they are, sealing off all the roads like this?

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
I think the answer to that lies in Nordopolica. 
We should hurry, before we're caught.
