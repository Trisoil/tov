Who Is This (KAR) Kid?

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
This (KAR) guy is kind of weird.

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
He does seem a bit restless, but that 
doesn't make him a bad person.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
He doesn't seem evil, but I'll bet he's got 
some weird thoughts going on in his head.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
You're only saying that because you 
can see some of yourself in him.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
You think the two of us are alike?

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
Yes. It's like you have genuine emotions, 
but your pride won't let you show them.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
So I can't bring myself to dislike him.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Huh...

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
Did I upset you?

## POINTER 10
(YUR)

about people you only just met, is all.

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
Hey...
