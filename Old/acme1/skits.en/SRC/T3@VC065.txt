## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
(YUR), you did it!

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Hmph, it's not such a big deal.

## POINTER 3
(RAV)
Come on, kid, ya won! The least 
ya could do is cheer up a little!

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
Yeah, I won...but that's not really 
what I was going for...

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Now, don't get greedy. What more 
could ya want than ta enter a 
tournament and come out on top?

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
Maybe what you wanted more than 
winning was the feeling that 
you'd really fought hard?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Yeah... Something like that.

## POINTER 8
(RAV)
Sounds like ya understand 
(YUR) pretty well.

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
After having known (YUR) for as long as 
I have, at least that much is obvious.

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
Really? I guess you two know 
each other...REALLY well...

## POINTER 11
(EST_P)
N-no, that's not what 
I meant at all...!
