The Manly Way

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
This ring just keeps getting 
new abilities.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
It got a new one back in 
Ghasfarost, didn't it?

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Back then, it was just 
you and me, (YUR).

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
I'd love to study it when I get a chance, 
but I guess now isn't the time.

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Well, at least this means we 
can go ta new places now.

## POINTER 6
(RAV)
That's good, right?

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
(RAV)'s right. We should go around 
shooting stuff and look for 
new places we can get into!

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Yeah, it's hard to tell whether 
something will react to the ring 
or not just by looking at it.

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
I don't know how I feel about 
just going around and shooting 
everything we can...

## POINTER 10
(JUD)
I like it. It's the manly 
way to do things!

## POINTER 11
(RAV)
...You like it?

## POINTER 12
(RAV)
Waahaa! Maybe if I shoot 
here? How about here?!

## POINTER 13
(RAV)
Yahaha! I did it! It opened! It opened!
