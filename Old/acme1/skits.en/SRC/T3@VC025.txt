Bring 'Em On

## POINTER 1
(YUR)
That was a pretty strong monster, 
but... I guess we're done.

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
"I guess we're done"?! Come on, we just 
defeated that gigantic monster!!

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Calm down, (KAR). Pull 
yourself together.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
Come on, (YUR), you could at least 
be a little bit happy...

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
...Huh? What's the matter, (EST_P)? 
Why are you sitting?

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
...How can both of you 
take it so easily?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
What, did you get scared, (EST_P)?

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
That huge monster... I 
was so nervous, I, I...

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
You were doing just fine 
while we were fighting.

## POINTER 10
(EST_P)
But if I got like this during 
battle, I'd end up causing 
trouble for everybody...

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
Don't worry about it, (EST_P). ...Here, 
let me give you a hand.

## POINTER 12
(EST_P)
I-I'm sorry...

## POINTER 13
(YUR)
There we go! Now, who do we get to 
fight next... Bring 'em on, right?

## POINTER 14
(EST_P)
I'd rather have "nobody" be next...

## POINTER 15
(KAR)
Huh? Hey, (YUR)... You're really ready 
for another fight, aren't you?
