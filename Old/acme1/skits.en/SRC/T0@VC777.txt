What the Don and (FRE) are Thinking

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Where were you talking with the Don, 
(YUR)? You were gone for a long time.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
We had a nice little chat through some thick iron bars.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
...(YUR), did you get (FRE) out of 
prison by trading places with him?

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
No, it's nothing like that.

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
(FRE) would've been released even 
if I hadn't gotten involved.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
What do you mean?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
The Don planned all along to capture 
(FRE), and use him to find out who's 
behind this whole mess.

## POINTER 8
(EST_P)
So both the Don and (FRE) know that there's 
someone else manipulating things?

## POINTER 9
(YUR)
Yeah. Why do I keep letting 
myself get caught 
up in this stuff?

## POINTER 10
(YUR)
Now the Don's making me do his dirty work...
What a pain!
