Fishier and Fishier

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
I never would have thought (RAV) 
was a member of Altosk.

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
It looked like he and the Don were close. The 
old man probably has a pretty important job.

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Y-yeah... It's hard to believe, but he's 
probably one of Altosk's top officers.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
The fact that he can leave town on guild 
business shows that the Don trusts him.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
That old man...

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
You can't judge a book by its cover, (RIT).

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
Fishier and fishier...
