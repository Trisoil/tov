On The Run

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
(YUR), you were a knight once, right?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Didn't you already say you 
heard about me from (FRE)?

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
...Well, it's just...you don't seem to 
know your way around the castle well...

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
*Gasp*... Are you an impostor?!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
That's some imagination you've got.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Why would I want to impersonate a 
regular guy from the lower quarter?

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
I-I guess you're right...

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Come on, let's go before we're 
caught by the castle guards.
