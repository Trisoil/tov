## POINTER 3
(RAP)
*...Whine...*

## POINTER 4

of what's around us...

## POINTER 5
(RAV)
Talk tough all ya want, but...it's 
pretty obvious ya kids 
aren't doing too well.

## POINTER 6

Just 'cause ya got a clear view 
doesn't mean ya can't get lost.

## POINTER 7
(RIT)
We're not lost...

## POINTER 8
(YUR)

us going missing while we're 
trying to find something...

## POINTER 9

*Woof*

## POINTER 10
