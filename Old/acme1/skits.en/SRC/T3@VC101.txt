I Like It!

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
It's so hot...

## POINTER 2
(RAV)
That's 'cause (RIT) keeps usin' 
all that fire magic.

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
It doesn't have anything 
to do with my magic! 
The desert's just hot!

## POINTER 4
(RAV)
Ack!

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
Whatever. It's just...really hot...

## POINTER 6
(RIT)
What...are you saying I should stop?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
I guess we're saying it'd be 
real nice if you would...

## POINTER 8
(RIT)
I won't stop...

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Huh...?

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
I won't stop. I like it.

## POINTER 11
(YUR)
Aren't you hot, too? Come on...

## POINTER 12
(RIT)
I'm hot! But using the magic makes 
me feel so good that I forget all 
about being hot, all right?!

## POINTER 13
(KAR)
Wah, (RIT)'s nuts!!
