What Not to Do when Gathering

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
We've finally managed to gather 
1000 items for synthesis! Woohoo!

## POINTER 2
(RIT)
What?! You've been counting?!

## POINTER 3
(KAR)
Huh? Y-yeah, I mean, I've been taking 
notes of how many items we found 
and where we found them...

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
Agh! That's weird! I mean, 
so pathetic! And creepy!

## POINTER 5
(YUR)
What can I say? Captain 
(KAR) loves maps.

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
He's been just as devoted to filling 
in our world map, too.

## POINTER 7
(RAV)
Oh boy, what a find, what a haul!

## POINTER 8
(RAV)
This beautiful mushroom 
looks so delicious!

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
!!

## POINTER 10
(RAV)
Mmmmm! *Nom nom*

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
Oh, (RAV), don't eat...

## POINTER 12
(RAV)
Whoa, this is GOOD!

## POINTER 13
(KAR)
...that mushroom.

## POINTER 14
(RAV)
Ahh hah hah hah!

## POINTER 15
(RAV)
Hah hah hah!

## POINTER 16
(RAV)
M-make it stop! Waaah hah hah hah!

## POINTER 17
(KAR)
That was a chuckleshroom. They're 
for synthesis, not eating...

## POINTER 18
(RIT)
Maybe that's what it takes to 
teach you not to eat everything 
you find on the ground?

## POINTER 19
(RAV)
Y-yer actin' like...heh...like it's my 
fault or somethin', damn it! Ha ha ha!

## POINTER 20
(YUR)
And we're supposed to take you seriously 
when you're laughing like that?
