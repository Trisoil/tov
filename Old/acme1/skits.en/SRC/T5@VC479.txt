I knew there was an ice drift 
north of Ilyccia, but I never 
thought I'd walk across it!

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
Well, it's nice to have the experience, 
but I don't think I ever want to cross 
that place again.

## POINTER 3
(JUD)
Oh, why's that?

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
Huh? Don't tell me you want to go 
back to that freezing icebox again!

## POINTER 5
(JUD)
Why not?

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
I thought it was a very beautiful 
place! Isn't that right, (RAP)?

## POINTER 7
(RAP)
*Woof!*

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
I can't believe (JUD_P) can stand 
this cold in that outfit.

## POINTER 9
(KAR)
Maybe she's got fur like (RAP)!
