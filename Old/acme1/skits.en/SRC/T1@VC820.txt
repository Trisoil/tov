(YUR)
We just started out, and we're already 
working with one of the five master 
guilds. This is good.

## POINTER 2
(JUD)
Yeah. You're one step closer to making your 
dream a reality, (KAR). Aren't you happy?

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
You talking to the kid? He's over 
there mumbling about something.

## POINTER 4
(KAR)
Mermen...the first thing had to be mermen. 
Brave Vesperia has some bad luck...

## POINTER 5
(KAR)
What's the president of Fortune's Market 
gonna think of us if we fail?!

## POINTER 6
(KAR)
This is bad. This is soooo bad.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
I don't think he's very happy.

## POINTER 8
(JUD)
He's just being careful, that's all.

## POINTER 9
(RIT)
That's not being careful. That's running and hiding.
