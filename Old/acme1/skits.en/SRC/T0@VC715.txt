The Curse, as (EST_P) Knows It

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Will this forest really get us 
to the other side of the Hold?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
If it doesn't, we'll just come back.

## POINTER 3
(EST_P)
...But what if I get turned into a frog 
or a snake by the forest's curse?!

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
If that happens, I'll 
take care of you.

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
You'll...take care of me?

## POINTER 6
(YUR)
Of course I would. Don't worry. 
I had pet frogs and snakes 
when I was a kid.

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
If you got turned into a frog or a snake, (YUR), 
I wouldn't have any idea what to feed you...
