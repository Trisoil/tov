It All Comes Back One Day

## POINTER 1
(KAR)
Hey... That change we got for 
what we bought, it had (RIT)'s 
name written on it...

## POINTER 2
(EST_P)
What...? ...(RIT)! (RIT)!!

## POINTER 3
(RIT)
What's all the commotion?

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
Our money came back to us with that 
last purchase we made! Look!

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
...! Didn't I tell you? Our money comes 
back, and it brings its friends!

## POINTER 6
(JUD)
Huh? You mean that wasn't 
just a fairy tale?

## POINTER 7
(KAR)
"(RIT) Mordio." It has your full 
name... How embarrassing...

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
I thought (EST_P) was spending 
more money than usual... 
So that was your doing.

## POINTER 9
(RAV)
Money is one thing, but what 
were ya thinkin', writin' 
yer name on all the tools?

## POINTER 10
(RIT)
Say someone buys one of our tools 
and likes it. Maybe they'll give 
us a little something in return!

## POINTER 11
(KAR)
...Talk about greedy...

## POINTER 12
(RAV)
All right, but would you at least quit 
writing your name on all the gels?

## POINTER 13
(EST_P)
(RIT)... We have to eat those...

## POINTER 14
(RIT)
But...but...!
