A New Journey

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Now that we have a goal and a destination, I'm 
so excited about continuing our journey!

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
This is a lot bigger than when we were just 
escaping the capital and chasing after (FRE).

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
We're out to find a mysterious talking monster.

## POINTER 4
(EST_P)
And to get over to Desier, we'll 
need to cross the sea again...

## POINTER 5
(EST_P)
I think the Sands of Kogorh will be 
a hot and harsh environment, too.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
Still, I can't help but be excited 
that I get to continue my journey!

## POINTER 7
(EST_P)
New landscapes we've never seen are waiting 
for us, just past the horizon!

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Well, just don't forget what we're out here for.

## POINTER 9
(EST_P)
I know.
