The Hunting Blades and the Monster

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
What do you think that scary monster 
we saw in Caer Bocram was?

## POINTER 2
(YUR)
That beast was way tougher than 
anything I've ever seen before.

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
If it didn't run away when it did, 
we'd have been in a world of hurt.

## POINTER 4
(RIT)
That's a surprisingly cautious opinion, coming from you.

## POINTER 5
(RIT)
Not that I disagree, when it 
comes to a monster like that.

## POINTER 6
(EST_P)
Do you think it was the Hunting Blades who 
trapped it in a reverse barrier?

## POINTER 7
(YUR)
...Yeah, probably... It looked like they'd 
come to take that monster down.

## POINTER 8
(YUR)
Whatever the case, I don't want to meet 
up with a monster like that again.
