The Mysterious Man in the Forest

## POINTER 1
(EST_P)
Just who was that strange person 
with the sword, anyway?

## POINTER 2
(KAR)
Do you think he came to Keiv Moc all by himself? 
There are so many monsters around...

## POINTER 3
(YUR)
Judging by the way he was standing, he's 
pretty confident in his own abilities.

## POINTER 4
(YUR)
He seemed calm, or even, like,  meditative...
Well whatever, he was a strange guy.

## POINTER 5

Yeah, I have no idea what was up with him at all.
