Looks like no one's here... No Imperial Knights, thieves, or anyone else!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Maybe they're further in?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
How far in are we talking, here?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
It doesn't look like anyone's 
been here, does it?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
The information about the underground 
couldn't have gotten out, could it?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
The underground?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Recently, an entrance to an underground 
area was uncovered here.<PAGE>A handful of mages are supposed to be 
the only people who know about it...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
But it's okay for us to know this?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
I don't have much choice if 
I'm to clear my name, do I?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Clear your name, huh...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
The ground is scratched here.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
It's not like I would've minded letting the thieves have 
the ruins above ground after we finished the excavation, 
but it's a good thing we came here when we did.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Well then, we'd better hurry up and follow 
them. All we have to do is move this?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
*Huff* *huff*

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Come on. You have to put 
your shoulder into it.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
Um, r-right.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Urgh... Huh...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Come on, just a little...more...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(KAR), are you okay?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
S-sure, that was a cinch... 
*huff* *huff*

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Okay, here we go.
