Can you see anything?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
I don't see anything at all...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
...After what happened 
to Belius...<PAGE>And with <STR>(JUD) breaking our 
blastia and running away...<PAGE>I just don't know what to think anymore.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Oh yeah?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
And then you went and cut your arm like that...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Heh, that was painful.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
It's not funny!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
But you healed me.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
I couldn't just ignore 
you, could I?<PAGE>I can't just ignore someone who's 
injured in front of me...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
So what are you all rattled about?<PAGE>Don't you remember? Belius said to 
take good care of your kind nature.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
My power is the reason 
that the Entelexeia hate 
me, isn't it?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
What with you being able to use magic without blastia...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Even if I make an effort not to 
use my power on the Entelexeia,<PAGE>... to them, I'll still be evil...<PAGE>That's why Phaeroh was trying to kill me.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
But Belius said you should try 
to meet Phaeroh, didn't she?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
Yeah, in order to discover my destiny...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
But I wonder...is 
that really right?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
...No, that can't be. I'm the 
one who'll decide my destiny.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Now you've got the idea.
