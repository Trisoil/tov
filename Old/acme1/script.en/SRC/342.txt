We weren't able 
to find Phaeroh 
after all...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, our first job as a guild 
was an egregious failure.<PAGE>What do you think, should 
we go back to Dahngrest?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
That might be best...but would 
you be okay with that, <STR>(YUR)?<PAGE>And what about <STR>(EST_P)?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
I'd be fine with it. 
As for <STR>(EST_P)...<PAGE>I'll leave that answer 
up to her.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
All right...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
This sure is a serene 
little town.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? Oh, yeah...it 
is, isn't it?<PAGE>No guilds, no empire...it's 
a little strange.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, but I think 
it's relaxing.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah... But even 
so, I prefer Dahngrest.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
That's how everyone is. 
Everybody prefers the place 
where they grew up.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
You too, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Well, yeah, sure.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
But if we're going to work together in 
Brave Vesperia, we'll have to decide on 
a single place for our home base.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
We could always make someplace 
new, you know.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Someplace new...?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, you know. Everyone thinks 
of Dahngrest as the Union's city, 
but it's really Altosk's city.<PAGE>It could be like that. 
Brave Vesperia could 
make its own city.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Brave Vesperia's own city... 
Yeah, I like that idea...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Well, either way.<PAGE>We've got a lot of jobs as a guild 
ahead of us before we can be thinking 
about things like that.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah...!<PAGE>...Now that you mention it, 
Nordopolica is Palestralle's 
city, isn't it?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, if you think of it that way, 
Nordopolica's more of a guild city 
than Dahngrest, even.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah. And Belius rules 
the city, too...<PAGE>Nordopolica, hmmm.... Leader of 
a city, Duce of a guild...<PAGE>I wonder what sort of 
person Belius is...?
