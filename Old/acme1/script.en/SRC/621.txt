Mr. Irmine, 
I presume?

## POINTER 1

Shut yer hole and 
leave me be.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
We've come to ask you about 
the process for refining 
Everlight, sir.

## POINTER 3

Everlight...whoo boy. Whoo 
nanny, whoo nanny...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
What did he say...? What sort 
of response is that...?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
Will you tell us what you know?

## POINTER 6

Are ya sure that's what ya wanna know? Why don't 
I tell ya the measurements of that fine young 
thing who works in the item shop, instead?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Hmm, he drives a hard 
bargain... Oof...!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
Before you tell us anything... You are 
the one called Irmine, are you not?

## POINTER 9

Now now, let's not stand on formalities and such.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
...Hey, are you sure this old 
coot's right in the head?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
So long as this is our only option, we 
don't really have much of a choice.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Is he really our only option...? 
He seems a bit on the 
sketchy side to me...

## POINTER 13
Irmine
Who're ya callin' sketchy?! The 
sketchiest thing around here is 
your sorry excuse for a haircut!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)... I think I'm 
ready to go now...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Come on, perk up a little.<PAGE>Listen, old man. We're here 
to ask you something serious. 
Enough with the games.

## POINTER 16
Irmine
I don't get anymore serious 
than this, sonny!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
...Okay then, we're here to ask 
you about the method for refining 
a metal called Everlight.

## POINTER 18
Irmine
If ya think I'm givin' that sorta info 
away fer free, you're plain nutty. You've 
gotta be nuttier than a...than a...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
...A fruitcake, perhaps? Those're pretty nutty.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
You want money? Or wait, you're 
not trying to get us to break 
you out of this joint, are you?

## POINTER 21
Irmine
Nah, that stuff's for amateurs!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Then, what is it?

## POINTER 23
Irmine
What I'd really love is a fine home-cooked meal.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
What?

## POINTER 25
Irmine
If you're too dumb to understand 
the first time, it's not going 
to help for me to say it again!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
Okay, the old goat's even startin' 
ta grate on me, believe it or not.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
That does it. We're gonna 
make this old lunatic the 
best meal he's ever had.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, but what should 
we fix for him?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(EST_P)
Why don't we try asking 
whoever's in charge of 
preparing his meals?
