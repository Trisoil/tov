<VOICE>(VS35_001)Our genius mage is givin' 
the ceres blastia her 
undivided attention.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS35_002)Sounds like the core

pretty much totalled.

<VOICE>(VS35_003)I just finished replacing 
the ceres blastia with 
a new model.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS35_004)I'd planned to do it ever

<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS35_005)So, luckily, we still had 
the old blastia around?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS35_006)Either way, looks 
like we'll be drifting 
out here for now.

<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS35_009)They're a bit down in the dumps. 
Why don't ya go check in on 'em?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS35_010)You'd probably be better at 
cheering them up, old man.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS35_011)You know I'm not 
cut out for that stuff.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS35_012)Guess I've had a hand 
in dampening the 
mood around here, too.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS35_013)Might as well see how they're doing.
