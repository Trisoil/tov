Welcome, welcome!
Here, make your 
self at home.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Thank you. But unfortunately
we need to be leaving very soon.

## POINTER 2

Are you leaving before 
that young knight is back?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
The situation's changed a bit.

## POINTER 4

Did something come up?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
You could say that.

## POINTER 6

If there's anything I can do to 
help, don't hesitate to ask.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
We appreciate the sentiment, but 
we can't ask for your help.

## POINTER 8

I see... Then, it's not 
much, but I'd at least 
like you to take this.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Who, me? I didn't do 
anything at all.

## POINTER 10

But since your friend helped 
us out so much...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Well then, I'd be happy to--

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
No, we can't take that!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Oh... um... yeah, I guess 
I can't... take that...

## POINTER 14

But then how will 
I ever repay you?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Well, how about this. The next time 
we come into town, set us up with VIP 
blossom viewing picnic seats!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
That's a great idea! 
I can't wait.

## POINTER 17

...All right then. The next time you're 
here, I'll put my heart and soul into 
paying back what you've done for us!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, can I ask you one thing? Have you 
ever heard of a town called Aspio?

## POINTER 19

...Aspio? Ah yes, I believe 
that was the name of the 
City of Shade...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
The City of Shade...

## POINTER 21

From what I've heard, the town lies 
between tall mountains, and sunlight 
rarely reaches its gates.<PAGE>Every now and then, a few quiet 
folks in cloaks and hoods come 
to our town to get supplies...<PAGE>But they're quite creepy, to be honest. 
Our town doesn't deal with them much.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Where is the town located?

## POINTER 23

Towards the east, I think. I wish I 
could tell you the exact location...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(FRE) was headed east 
as well, wasn't he?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah. I suppose a "city of 
scholars" might have some link 
to blastia, after all.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
Thanks, that's all I needed.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
I'm coming for 
you, Mordio!
