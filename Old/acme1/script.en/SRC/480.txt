<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS50_032)This'll bring the value back down, so the 
discrepancy with this should...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS50_033)...Nope, it's nowhere near enough.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS50_034)<STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_035)...What are you all 
doing out here?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS50_036)Shut up and leave me alone!
Oh, it's you.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_037)Nice to see you too. So, 
what kind of experiment 
is this, anyway?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_038)...Is something wrong?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS50_039)No, it's being kept
well under control,
and it's stable.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_040)As annoying as it is to admit, 
Dein Nomos and this sytem of 
Alexei's are both pretty amazing.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_041)So then, where's the problem?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS50_042)The effective area of control is more
limited than I thought.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_043)The control barrier originates at the
barrier blastia. She's stable inside it,
but she can't leave.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_044)I guess Dein Nomos alone couldn't take
the place of all those apatheia.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_045)So long trips are out 
of the question?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS50_046)Also, the barrier blastia's part of the system.
As long as it's in use, this city is defenseless.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_047)That's why I'm out here trying 
to figure out a way for her to 
move around freely.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_048)Why can't <STR>(EST_P) just take Dein Nomos
with her wherever she goes?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS50_049)It was really only designed to contain 
aer that's gone out of control.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_050)I don't think it could actually affect
<STR>(EST_P) in any way.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_051)I guess that's how it 
was with Duke, too.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS50_052)Don't worry. I'll come up with 
something, or my name
isn't <STR>(RIT) Mordio.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_053)I won't let <STR>(EST_P) wind up 
trapped like that again.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_054)Nobody treats my friend like
just some... thing.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_055)Okay. I'll leave you to it.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_056)Nothing to worry about. 
You've got the best genius 
under the sun with you.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS50_057)Yes, I know <STR>(RIT) can help me.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS50_058)I'll have this ready by tomorrow.
You get yourself to bed.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_059)Okay, okay. Don't push 
yourself too hard. 
Same to you, <STR>(EST_P).
