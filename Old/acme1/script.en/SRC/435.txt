<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(FRE) sent his knights 
to help us!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
That idiot...sending the better part 
of his subordinates over here! He should 
be worried about his own butt.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
They did save us, though.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
He must really be worried.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
About us? Or about 
<STR>(EST_P)?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Both, I'd hope.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
I swear...it's not like 
he has time to be worrying 
about other people.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
So <STR>(FRE) hasn't completely hardened 
to others either...
