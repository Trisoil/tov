You're always out 
walking around, 
aren't you?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
Yes, I guess I'm a pretty 
restless person.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
That's unexpected.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
You seem to have some 
problems staying put, 
yourself.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
I'm pretty restless, 
myself.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
That's...not so unexpected, I think.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
Maybe it's the wanderlust coming 
back to me from when I used to fly 
around with Ba'ul all the time.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, back when you were wearing 
that weird white armor...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
Yes.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
Are you going to go look 
for Phaeroh by yourself?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Nah

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, then where were you 
planning on going?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Only a walk.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, I see.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Doesn't it seem like we've been 
meeting this way a lot recently?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
No, must be your imagination.
