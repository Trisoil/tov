Master...

## POINTER 1
Drake
I believe that I already told 
you of the importance of each 
and every one of your actions.<PAGE>And yet, you insist on acting 
rashly, guided by your 
own emotional whims.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
In the course of my journey, I've discovered that people 
in higher positions in society need to look at the big picture, 
and not be distracted by the world before them.<PAGE>That's what you were talking 
about, correct?<PAGE>But I can't choose what's 
important while completely 
ignoring everything I see.

## POINTER 3
Drake
You are not doing things in the right way.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, I know...

## POINTER 5
Drake
However, as Princess, 
you should do what you 
believe is correct.<PAGE>I have no right to stand in the way of 
the path you have chosen for yourself.

## POINTER 6

Master...

## POINTER 7
Drake
I didn't want to hear the "right answer". 
I wanted to know your true, unwavering 
opinion of what you think is right.<PAGE>Eyes firm with resolve, overflowing with 
grace and pride...that is the true proof 
that one belongs in the noble family.

## POINTER 8

Child of the Full Moon, may 
you always follow your heart.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. Thank you so 
much, Master.

There are surely still 
things left for you 
to do. Please hurry.
