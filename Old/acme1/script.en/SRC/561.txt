Hey, <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
What's up, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
We finished <STR>(EST_P)'s request. 
Shouldn't Brave Vesperia start 
looking for other jobs?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, you're right. Hmm, I 
wonder what we should do.<PAGE>We could get a job in 
Dahngrest if we were 
members of the Union...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
Hey kid, didn't ya know?<PAGE>The Union'll throw you work 
even if ya don't join 'em. 
They take a cut, but...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Really?!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
Really!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
But it'll take us some time
to return to Dahngrest 
from here...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
If we can find a Union's 
outpost staff around, we might
be able to get a job.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
Then why not look for them?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
<STR>(JUD_P), ya coming?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Uh... but, what should we do
about Phaeroh?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
If this is something we need to
do as a guild, I don't mind.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Thank you <STR>(EST_P)!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
OK, let's go.
