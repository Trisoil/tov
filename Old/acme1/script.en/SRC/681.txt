Is the ocean bigger 
than the lake?

## POINTER 1

It's much bigger, and much deeper. The ocean 
is bluer than any lake, and prettier, too!

## POINTER 2

Fish live in the ocean, 
right? Where is it?

## POINTER 3

Is it far from here?

## POINTER 4

Yeah, it's a little far from here.

## POINTER 5

Aw man! I wanted 
to go see it!

## POINTER 6

You can go when you get older. You can 
get on a big ship and go to other cities, 
and see all sorts of new stuff!

## POINTER 7

Yeah!
