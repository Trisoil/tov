What's going on, Leblanc?

## POINTER 1
Leblanc
Captain Schwaaaaaann!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
Nah, ya got me mixed up with somebody else.

## POINTER 3
Leblanc
I apologize! You are Sir Raaaaaaven, 
plain and simple!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
There he goes again with the "Sir 
<STR>(RAV), plain and simple."

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
What's a former elite officer of 
the Schwann Brigade doin' loiterin' 
around a place like this?

## POINTER 6
Leblanc
Ah, well, you see, that is...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Concise reporting, Leblanc.

## POINTER 8
Leblanc
Yes, sir! I was agonizing 
over the future of the 
Schwann Brigade, sir!<PAGE>I believe that we should go help to fill the ranks 
of the <STR>(FRE) Brigade, but other lieutenants 
claim that we should remain in the capital.<PAGE>With the officers paralyzed with hesitation 
about our next step, our subordinates are 
losing their faith in us as leaders!<PAGE>I am so ashamed! How 
can I ever face Captain 
Schwann like this?!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
And yet, what if he happened to be 
standing right in front of you?

## POINTER 10
Leblanc
I am so sorry!!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RIT)!
Ummm...<STR>(RAV)?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
Well, I can't just turn a blind 
eye ta the brigade. It was Schwann 
who led 'em inta all this.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
Are you going to gather the members 
of the Schwann Brigade together 
and lead them yourself?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
...Leblanc. Is that what 
ya want me ta do?

## POINTER 15
Leblanc
Sir, no sir! I do not 
want to cause trouble 
for you, Sir <STR>(RAV)!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
So then, who's going to decide 
where the brigade will go?

## POINTER 17
Leblanc
Sir, that would be me, sir! I will proudly 
bear the weight of the responsibility 
and guidance for my brigade!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RAV)
If ya've made yer decision, 
then act on that decision.<PAGE>And I'm willin' ta bet that Schwann would think 
it's important ta support the <STR>(FRE) Brigade 
in addition ta guardin' the capital.

## POINTER 19
Leblanc
Yes, sir! 
Thank you, sir!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
Sounds like you gave 
him some good advice.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
Nah, <STR>(RAV) just gave him a 
little push. Leblanc already 
knew what he wanted to do.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
The first time I heard you were actually 
Captain Schwann, I didn't believe it. 
But you're just like the rumors said!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
Just like the rumors said, 
but not just like you thought 
Captain Schwann would be?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
No! That is, I mean...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
It was the same when Harry and the guild 
members asked for your help. You really 
watch out for others, don't you, old man?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
Nah, I listened ta what Leblanc 
had ta say. That's all I did.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, is somebody embarrassed?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RAV)
Aw, <STR>(JUD) baby, cut ol' <STR>(RAV) 
some slack, would ya?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
You helping people without pampering 
them... That's tough. I wonder if 
I'll ever be like you, <STR>(RAV)...

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RAV)
Puttin' ol' <STR>(RAV) up on a pedestal 
won't get ya anywhere in life, kid.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(EST_P)
Lots of people respect and 
admire Captain Schwann.<PAGE>So I don't think you 
really have to deny 
everything about him.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(RAV)
I can't argue with 
such a pretty girl!
