...I'm just incorrigible...<PAGE>Whenever something or someone catches my eye, 
I forget all about everything else...<PAGE>I really lose sight of 
everything I was planning 
on doing beforehand.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Yep, that's about right.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
I came to my senses after 
<STR>(JUD) told me.<PAGE>Until now, I've been dragging 
the rest of you around with me 
like there's no tomorrow...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, it could be worse.<PAGE>If you were empress, one word from 
you and the entire empire would 
run off to do your bidding!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Yeah, hmmm...<PAGE>I kind of feel like coming with 
you was the right choice.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Oh yeah?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
I've been able to see all 
sorts of new things.<PAGE>I still don't know whether I'm going 
to take the imperial throne, but...<PAGE>There are still so many 
things left to learn about 
in this world.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
And Phaeroh's one 
of those things?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
...It scares me to think about it, 
but... I have to know who I am.<PAGE>I have to know what he meant 
by saying I was the "insipid 
poison of this world."

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
It sounds like you've made up your mind.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Hmm?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
I might end up trying 
to order you guys 
around again.<PAGE>Next time I do that, yell at me, would you?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Heh, sure. It's not the sort of personality 
trait that's easy to fix by yourself.<PAGE>Though there's another guy who's also a tough 
nut to crack, so I think we'll let him be 
the one we vent our frustration on.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
Well, I'm going back to 
the inn. I'll see you.
