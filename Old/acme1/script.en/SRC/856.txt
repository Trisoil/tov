...Then...can we get out of 
the labyrinth from here?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Or maybe it leads to the land of the dead?

## POINTER 3

That is your own choice.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Our choice...?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Aaack!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
Is this... Is this the one the 
book was referring to...?

## POINTER 7

Will you win or will you lose? Victory 
will open the door to salvation, but 
failure will lead to your demise!<PAGE>Death will be more than happy

embrace. Hee hee hee...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
I'm not sure, but it sounds ta me like he's

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
But isn't that an exit 
right up ahead...?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
I'm not sure... Let's 
go and see...
