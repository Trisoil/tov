Why would something like this happen...?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
I wonder if maybe the groundwater's 
dried up...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
The groundwater?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. The water in the lake comes 
from an aquifer of groundwater 
deep beneath the ground.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, okay. That makes 
sense, then.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
What do you mean?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
The spirits have been doing all sorts 
of things to the planet lately.<PAGE>Making tree roots grow, sucking 
up energy from magma...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
So you're saying that could've changed 
the flow of water beneath the surface?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
No way! We're talking about 
an entire continent here...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
There's something I've 
heard of before...the 
ground vein.<PAGE>It's a giant underground 
water vein, flowing deep 
beneath the ocean floor.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
With the spirits' power, changing 
the flow of something like 
that would be easy.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Wow... The spirits are 
really powerful...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
If they wanted to, they could 
probably even change the 
seasons themselves.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
That's scary...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
Anyway, it looks like 
we can go down to the 
old lake's floor now.
