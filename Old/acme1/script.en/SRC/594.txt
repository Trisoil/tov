Yo. We've taken care of the job.

## POINTER 1
Mimula
My my, welcome home.

## POINTER 2
Sebastian
Ah, ah yes. Thanks for everything... 
Heh heh heh...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
We'd like to settle up with 
you, if you don't mind.

## POINTER 4
Mimula
You did rather well, for commoners. Not 
that the job was all that difficult.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)...!

## POINTER 6
Mimula
Oh, so you don't need it? Hmph, I thought 
beggars couldn't afford to be choosers.

## POINTER 7
Mimula
Oh, so you decided 
you weren't too big 
to get paid, huh?

## POINTER 8
Accept reward?
Accept
I'll pass

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Thank you very much.

## POINTER 10
Mimula
That's right. Thank me all you 
wish. I don't give handouts 
to just anyone, you know.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
...Huh? This feels like 
it's missing something...

## POINTER 12
Mimula
What? There's 200 Gald and plenty 
of gummy worms in that bag.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
What? After she 
built it up that 
much, that's it?

## POINTER 14
Mimula
Oooh!! What did you expect?! 
This is all I can afford, 
at this point!

## POINTER 15
Sebastian
My Lady. Calm 
yourself...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, the poor thing. Perhaps we 
should be giving money to you.

## POINTER 17
Mimula
Oooooh!

## POINTER 18
Leblanc
Accomplices of the extremists! 
Stand where you are, and 
reach for the sky!

## POINTER 19

Yikes...!

## POINTER 20
Boccos
Lieutenant Leblanc, 
weapons! They're dealing 
in weapons here!

## POINTER 21
Adecor
You all come, I say, come with me!

## POINTER 22
Mimula
Oooh! You keep your grubby 
little hands off me!

## POINTER 23
Leblanc
<STR>(YUR) Lowell...! 
It's you...!

## POINTER 24
Leblanc
The extremists are rabble-rousing 
criminals. I'm surprised 
to see you aiding them.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
You know how it 
is. Can't let you 
guys get bored.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
Hey!

## POINTER 27
Leblanc
Sch... I mean... Not you 
too, Captain <STR>(RAV)?!

## POINTER 28
Boccos
Wh-what are we to do...?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RAV)
Why, there's only one thing to do...<PAGE>...Atten-SHUN!!

## POINTER 30
Leblanc
Yes, Sir!

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
Some things never change.

## POINTER 32
Mimula
Um, what's going on...?

## POINTER 33
Leblanc
Drat...gets me every time...

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
Nope, I just can't take it.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(YUR)...?!

## POINTER 36
Mimula
What? Do you mean to say that 
you won't be accepting my 
most charitable reward?<PAGE>Oooh! Silly 
commoners! 
Oooh!

## POINTER 37
<STR>(YUR)
Best to be prudent 
at times like this.

## POINTER 38
<STR>(EST_P)
Right...
