Oh, buona sera! How 
have you been?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Oh, it's Mr. Sicily!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)

is definitely following us.

## POINTER 3

Professor Sicily... 
I missed you, jarnk!!

## POINTER 4
Sicily
Oh, it's Sterrilow! 
Have you been well, 
Sterrilow?

## POINTER 5
Karolow X
I've been very well, jaaaarnk! 
It looks like you've been well 
too, Professor Sicily! Jarnk!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Sterrilow...? That's 
not his name...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
So what? <STR>(KAR)ow doesn't 
seem to mind, anyway.

## POINTER 8

Th-thieeeef! 
Catch him!!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Get him, <STR>(RAP)!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 11

Y-you stupid mutt...!!

## POINTER 12

That was amazing...
Thank you, my canine friend...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAP)
Woof woof!

## POINTER 14
Sicily
What an amazing dog!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, you can count on 
<STR>(RAP). He's more reliable 
than most humans I know.

## POINTER 16
Sicily
So he can really fight after 
all... He has a weapon too!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
That's right! <STR>(RAP)'s faster 
than just about anything!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 19
Sicily
Hmmm... This gives me 
some motivazione...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? Now you've taken an 
interest in <STR>(RAP)...?

## POINTER 21
Sicily
Si, I think so...I think I could make
something very nice... But could he 
really use it to its full potential...?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
It seems like...you have 
something on your mind.

## POINTER 23
Karolow X
Be quiet, jarnk! 
Professor Sicily 
is thinking!

## POINTER 24
Sicily
Hmmm, it looks like 
this dog should be 
able to use it! Si!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
What's that? Something 
about <STR>(RAP)?

## POINTER 26
Sicily
Just wait un momento. 
I will make you something 
very good...

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RAV)
I hope it's not some lousy let down 
like <STR>(KAR)ow X again...

## POINTER 28
Karolow X
Are you making fun of me?
How dare you! How daaaare you!

## POINTER 29
Sicily
Finito!!

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RAV)
Wow, yer sure fast at this stuff...

## POINTER 31
Sicily
I think this should be just 
right for your canine amico!

## POINTER 32
<STR>(JUD)
It looks like it's a 
weapon for <STR>(RAP).

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
Now this is something 
we can use!

## POINTER 34
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 35
Karolow X
You're the greatest, Professor 
Sicily! It's amazing, jaarnk!

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I've gotta say...thanks a lot.

## POINTER 37
Sicily
You don't need to thank me! 
Your dog just sparked my 
interest a bit, you know?

## POINTER 38
<STR>(YUR)
Ah, I see.

## POINTER 39
<STR>(RAV)
G-good for you, <STR>(RAP)...

## POINTER 40
<STR>(JUD)
Is someone getting a little 
lonely because no one's 
interested in him lately?

## POINTER 41
<STR>(RAV)
Ha ha ha, whaddaya mean...? 
Enough with the jokes, 
<STR>(JUD) darlin'...

## POINTER 42
Sicily
Well then, until we meet 
again, amici! Arrivederci!

## POINTER 43
Sicily
Hmmm, si... It appears you need 
to be a bit stronger first...

## POINTER 44
<STR>(YUR)
What's that? Something about <STR>(RAP)?

## POINTER 45
Sicily
Your canine amico should come 
back when he is stronger! I'll make 
you something very nice if you do!

## POINTER 46
<STR>(RAV)
I hope it's not some lousy let 
down like <STR>(KAR)ow X again...

## POINTER 47
Karolow X
Are you making fun of me?
How dare you! How daaaare you!

## POINTER 48
<STR>(YUR)
All right, we'll be sure to swing
by once <STR>(RAP)'s gotten stronger
than he is now.

## POINTER 49
Sicily
Si, very good! Good luck!

## POINTER 50
<STR>(KAR)
I wonder if he's planning 
something crazy like last time?

## POINTER 51
<STR>(YUR)
I dunno. I can't wait for <STR>(RAP) 
to get a bit tougher so we can 
see what he's got up his sleeve.

## POINTER 52
<STR>(JUD)
We'd better hurry before 
that guy finds something 
else to get obsessed with.

## POINTER 53
<STR>(YUR)
You ready to work hard, <STR>(RAP)?

## POINTER 54
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 55
Sicily
Oh, your canine amico looks 
much stronger than last time!

## POINTER 56
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 57
Sicily
I think maybe he'll be 
able to use it now...

## POINTER 58
Sicily
Just wait un momento, okay? I will 
make you something very good...

## POINTER 59
Sicily
Finito!!

## POINTER 60
<STR>(RAV)
Wow, yer sure fast at this stuff...

## POINTER 61
Sicily
I think this should be just 
right for your canine amico!

## POINTER 62
<STR>(JUD)
It looks like it's a 
weapon for <STR>(RAP).

## POINTER 63
<STR>(YUR)
Now this is something we can use!

## POINTER 64
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 65
Karolow X
You're the greatest, Professor 
Sicily! It's amazing, jaarnk!

## POINTER 66
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I've gotta say...thanks a lot.

## POINTER 67
Sicily
You don't need to thank me! Your dog, he 
just sparked my interest a bit, you know?

## POINTER 68
<STR>(YUR)
Ah, I see.

## POINTER 69
<STR>(RAV)
G-good for you, <STR>(RAP)...

## POINTER 70
<STR>(JUD)
Is someone getting a little 
lonely because no one's 
interested in him lately?

## POINTER 71
<STR>(RAV)
Ha ha ha, whaddaya mean...? 
Enough with the jokes, 
<STR>(JUD) darlin'...

## POINTER 72
Sicily
Well then, until we meet again, 
amici! Arrivederci!

## POINTER 73
Sicily
Hmmm, your canine amico still isn't 
strong enough. Signor Dog, come back 
when you are more forte! More...robusto!

## POINTER 74
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, I see...

## POINTER 75
<STR>(RAP)
*Whimper*

## POINTER 76
<STR>(KAR)
At least it seems like he's 
still interested in <STR>(RAP)... 
We should hurry.
