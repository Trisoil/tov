## POINTER 0

Alas! Woe is me...
When sorrows come, they 
come not single spies, but in battalions...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Excuse me, is something the matter?

## POINTER 2

Oh? Why, you're...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, why are you looking at us like 
that? You creep, learn some manners!

## POINTER 4

O-oh, pardon me, I apologize. I'm a member 
of the actors' guild, Showtime.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
We never asked who ya were...

## POINTER 6

Ever since that strange monster appeared 
in the sky, the other members have 
stopped coming to perform...<PAGE>Please! Take their 
place on stage!<PAGE>All of you are just the right height... I think 
their costumes would fit perfectly on you.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
Oo, this sounds like fun!

## POINTER 8

At this rate, we'll lose all our credibility 
and our guild will be through!<PAGE>Please! Help us! 
I beg you!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
How could anyone turn down someone 
in such obvious distress?<PAGE>But...I wonder if we can really pull it off..

## POINTER 10

Oh, you'll help! Okay, there are four parts to play, 
so I'll need the young man, the pretty girl, the foul-mouthed 
girl, and the boy to act in the play.<PAGE>The show will be starting soon, so please go and 
change, and learn your lines as fast as you can!<PAGE>Men are this way! Women are that way!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
H-hey, quit your pushing!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
So these are the costumes... 
Wow, <STR>(RIT), yours 
is so cute!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Ugh! Do I really have to 
wear this piece of trash?<PAGE>No way! I'm not doing it!<PAGE>Ngah, you can't make me wear that!!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Man...no matter how you look at it, these 
are some pretty butt-ugly clothes.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
At least you're better off than I am. They 
even seem to fit your personality a bit...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
This is going to be great!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
Well, since it seems I blew the auditions 
on this one, I might as well go an' 
find me a seat in the audience.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 19
Narrator
After surmounting countless obstacles, 
the heroine <STR>(EST_P) has finally infiltrated 
the Dark Lord's castle.

## POINTER 20
Heroine
Dark Lord <STR>(YUR)! I will 
defeat you, and rescue 
the princess!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
Oo, looks like she means business!

## POINTER 22
Princess
H-heroine, s-save 
meee!

## POINTER 23
Dark Lord
Gah hah hah! What can 
a measly human like you  
hope to accomplish?!<PAGE>Today you will meet your  
maker! Prepare yourself, 
heroine <STR>(EST_P)!<PAGE><STR>(KAR), my minion! Get her!

## POINTER 24
Minion
Filth like you is not worthy of crossing 
swords with the Dark Lord!<PAGE>Take this! Yaa!

## POINTER 25
Princess
H-heroine!

## POINTER 26
Heroine
Now it's my turn!

## POINTER 27
Minion
Waah, eeeek!

## POINTER 28

Oo, the action scenes are 
great this time around!

## POINTER 29
Heroine
And now for the fatal blow!

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
What lame special effects!<PAGE>Time to spice things up a bit.

## POINTER 31
Minion
Huh? Waah! What the 
heck is this?!

## POINTER 32
Minion
I'm done for...

## POINTER 33

Wow! The choreography is excellent! 
That minion's acting was great, too.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(RAV)
He wasn't actin'...

## POINTER 35
Princess
Oh, heroine!

## POINTER 36
Heroine
Prepare to die, Dark Lord!

## POINTER 37
Dark Lord
You need to learn some humility, human!

## POINTER 38
Dark Lord
You think that's enough to stop me?!

## POINTER 39
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR), let me beat you like 
it says in the script!

## POINTER 40
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, this way is more exciting. 
Let's keep fighting a bit.

## POINTER 41
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, okay. Maybe that's even better.

## POINTER 42

Wow! This is great! Amazing!

## POINTER 43
Princess
Heroine! Look out! A-and the 
Dark Lord, too... I, agh!

## POINTER 44

Oh no, the princess suffered a direct hit!

## POINTER 45
<STR>(RIT)
T-that wasn't 
in the script!

## POINTER 46
<STR>(YUR)
Perhaps our shenanigans have gone a bit too far.

## POINTER 47
<STR>(EST_P)
...Why'd you have to hit me too...?

## POINTER 48
Narrator
And thus, Princess <STR>(RIT) slayed 
the Dark Lord herself, and restored 
peace to the world.<PAGE>The end.
