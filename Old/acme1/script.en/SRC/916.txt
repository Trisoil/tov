Hey, not bad! You collected 
a ton of treasures!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
We went all over the world!

## POINTER 2

Show me, show me!

## POINTER 3

Ooo, this is very nice!<PAGE>Oh, I've heard of this!<PAGE>Oh, this one is pretty useless...<PAGE>Great! Thank you! 
This should 
help a lot!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? That's 
all you need?

## POINTER 5

It's enough, it's enough! I've 
stored everything I've seen 
up in this noggin of mine!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
Then you'll be able to get the treasure 
fishing up and running soon?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
But ya'll need some 
time to get things 
rollin', won't ya?

## POINTER 8

Yes, indeed. To fill it 
up I think...100 treasures 
should do the trick?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
Even making 100 treasures 
sounds like pretty 
daunting work.

## POINTER 10

No, not at all! 
It's fun!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
You're really something, you know that?

## POINTER 12

You're really something 
yourself, kid.

## POINTER 13

You went into all the world's nooks and crannies 
and opened all of the treasure chests you saw!<PAGE>By now, most of the treasure chests 
in the world are empty!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
You make it sound like 
I'm a thief, or a miser, 
or something.

## POINTER 15

Indeed! In your quest for treasure, you leave 
no stone unturned...in fact, you leave 
no stones at all! You take them all! âˆ€
