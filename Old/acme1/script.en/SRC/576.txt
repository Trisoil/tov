Oh, you're that guild from last time...
Many thanks for your help back then.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, we should be thanking 
you for giving us the job.

## POINTER 2
Yu
...Actually, you've come at a perfect time...
I have a favor I'd like to ask.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
What is it?

## POINTER 4
Yu
My friend Nobis--the one to whom 
you delivered that book--is looking 
for people to do a job.<PAGE>Would you mind going 
and hearing what 
he has to say?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Well...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Hold on. Can we take 
a job without asking 
the Union first?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
The Union doesn't keep 
other guilds from doing 
their own work.<PAGE>The Union system for getting jobs 
is just to help out guilds that 
couldn't get work on their own.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
So we just 
moved up as 
a guild.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Exactly. And this way, there's 
no finder's fee, so we get 
all the money ourselves!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Huh.<PAGE>All right, we'll go talk to 
your friend and decide whether 
or not to take the job.

## POINTER 11
Yu
Thank you. He's most 
likely in Torim harbor 
right now.<PAGE>Please go there and listen 
to what he has to say.
