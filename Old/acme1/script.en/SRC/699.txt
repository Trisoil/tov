Th-they say that some lady's body 
is buried under this tree...

## POINTER 1

Y-yeah, I hear that she 
was the wife of some emperor 
a long time ago...

## POINTER 2

Nuh-uh! I heard that she 
died before the wedding! 
So she wasn't his wife.

## POINTER 3

Whatever! It's s-scary, 
but... I think 
it's true!

## POINTER 4

Yeah, Halure's flowers are so cool...it's 
hard to believe something weird like
that happened...

## POINTER 5

Th-this explains what's 
been making us feel so funny 
about this tree...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
Excuse me... You know, that 
story's not actually true.

## POINTER 7

Nuh-uh... The Mayor 
told it to us!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
What the heck was that old 
man thinking, anyway...

## POINTER 9

And what about this...?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, what a lovely veil.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
Where did you get that?

## POINTER 12

A white shadow, like 
a ghost, dropped it!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
You're not saying that the white shadow 
was the ghost of the dead bride...?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
N-no way...! There's 
no such thing as ghosts 
and curses!

## POINTER 15

It's true!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
No it's not! It's not, it's not!<PAGE>I'm sure that veil was just dropped 
by someone in your village!

## POINTER 17

The Mayor went around and asked everybody, 
but it didn't belong to anybody...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
There's no way... It's 
just not true, OKAY?!

## POINTER 19

This girl is really 
scary...

## POINTER 20

Let's get out of here...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, you forgot this...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RIT)...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
I'm sorry...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
What should I do with this...?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
Throw it away.<PAGE>The kids don't want 
something as ominous 
as that, I'm sure.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(EST_P)
But I don't think it seems all 
that ominous. I actually think 
it seems more...holy...<PAGE>...I think I've taken a 
liking to it. Do you mind 
we take it with us?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RIT)
Argh... If you get cursed 
it's your own fault!

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
I thought you said there's no such thing as curses?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RIT)
Sh-shut up, <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 30
<STR>(EST_P)
I wonder if there's 
an explanation that's 
more...holy...

## POINTER 31
<STR>(EST_P)
It seems like there's something 
more beautiful to all this...
