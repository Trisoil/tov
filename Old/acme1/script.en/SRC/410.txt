So this is where 
Phaeroh is?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
Should be. I wasn't able to see him 
when we came to the desert, but I think 
this is where we can meet him.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
I hope nothing bad will happen... 
What if he suddenly attacks us?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
I can't make any guarantees. I don't 
think we'll have a say in the matter.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(KAR), are you okay?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
No, I'm not okay... 
I should go...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
Phaeroh sure did pick 
a bleak place ta live 
in, dontcha think?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
They say this area used to be 
covered in lush greenery.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
Why did it turn 
into this rocky 
desert?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
Hmmm, I don't know that much.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(EST_P), are you really going to meet him?<PAGE>Even though you 
could be killed?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. I've already...made my 
peace with this decision.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(RIT), you've been acting a little funny ever 
since hearing <STR>(JUD_P)'s story on the ship.<PAGE>Do you have a problem 
with meeting Phaeroh?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
I just think it'll be hard on her 
to hear what he has to say.<PAGE>But it's too late 
to turn back now.<PAGE>We've come this far, after all.
