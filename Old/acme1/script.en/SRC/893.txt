I really can't thank you enough for 
everything you've done for me.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
Come on, ya don't need ta thank 
us. We got paid for it, and we 
even got nice new uniforms. âˆ€

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
You sure are a sucker 
for pretty girls, old man.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
I wonder if all this work we've done 
would have made the Don happy...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Of course it would have. I'm 
sure that he would be glad 
that we're all helping out.

## POINTER 5

I'll bet he's looking down on 
us all from somewhere with a 
big, fat grin on his face.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
So you never ended 
up working at 
all, huh <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I guess not. This type 
of work just doesn't suit me.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
Hey, you never know. You 
might turn out to be 
a pretty good waiter.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Just once, I'd like to see what 
<STR>(YUR) looks like waiting tables...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Stare me down as hard 
as you want... I'm 
not doing it.

## POINTER 11

Too bad. I'll bet you'd be pretty popular. 
Not every tavern can claim to have such 
a stubborn waiter on their staff.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
"What the hell can I get you?"

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
"Don't order that! It's horrible!"

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
"Eat this, you idiot!"

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
"I don't need your money! Go home!"

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, I think he'd be a hit.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Am I really like that?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
You'd be surprised.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
......
I think I'll 
leave the waiter stuff 
to you guys.
