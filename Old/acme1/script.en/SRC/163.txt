Whaddaya want?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
I'd like to meet with Magistrate 
Ragou, if you'd be so kind.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(YUR), these men are mercenaries. 
I wonder what guild they're 
from...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
I guess that explains the thuggish look.

## POINTER 4

Hmph, go home! Scram! The 
magistrate is a busy man.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Surely not too busy to rough up the people in this town?

## POINTER 6

Hey, you better watch 
your mouth, punk!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
See, I told you he wouldn't 
see us. Let's get out of here 
before things get sticky.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
I'd have to agree with Captain <STR>(KAR) on this one.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
But, there must be some other way...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Forget it. Let's go.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
We'd best leave the frontal assault on 
the palace to the Imperial Knights.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
But isn't the fact that that's 
going so badly precisely what's 
got <STR>(FRE) in such a bad mood?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Hmph. Maybe he'd see 
us if we came bearing 
gifts, so to speak?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
A gift? What 
do you mean?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
The Rhybgaro. It's worth a fair 
amount of money, right?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
Come to think of it, that official 
mentioned the Rhybgaro.<PAGE>He said that someone with its horn would 
never have to worry about taxes again.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
If we brought something that valuable, the magistrate 
would at least grant us an audience.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
You propose to catch 
the Rhybgaro?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
This is our chance! It's 
raining, after all!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
What does rain have to do with it?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
The Rhybgaro comes out of 
hiding when it's raining!<PAGE>Out of all the monsters I 
know, it's the only one that 
goes out in the rain.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Capital observation, Captain 
<STR>(KAR). What else?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
...What do you mean, "what else?" 
That's all there is to it!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
So where's the Rhybgaro now?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(KAR)
Er, uh...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
...Just as I thought.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(EST_P)
Well then, let's go talk to the people in 
town and get their side of the story.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Are you okay with 
this, <STR>(EST_P)?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
If we're unlucky, this could put all 
of us on the wrong side of the law.<PAGE>The one who makes the laws in this town 
is his lordship, the empire's magistrate. 
You'd be okay with defying him?

## POINTER 31
<STR>(EST_P)
...I'm going with you.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(YUR)
You're okay with it, then.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(RIT), you don't have any problems with it?

## POINTER 35
<STR>(RIT)
I have to say, I'm incredibly interested in 
a blastia that can control the weather.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(EST_P)
Then it's decided!

## POINTER 37
<STR>(YUR)
So then, let's seek out 
the Rhybgaro first.
