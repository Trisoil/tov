You idiot! You've got no idea what 
the hell you're talking about!

## POINTER 1

What did you just say, 
you pea-brained peon?!

## POINTER 2

Damn it! You'd better watch your mouth...!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
This city hasn't changed a bit...

## POINTER 4

That's quite enough!

## POINTER 5
Natz
You two will stop 
fighting right now!

## POINTER 6

Who the hell are you...!

## POINTER 7
Natz
I am Natz, of Palestralle. 
I'm the provisional Duke.<PAGE>I do not know the cause of 
your argument, but I shall 
help you resolve it.

## POINTER 8

Resolve it?

## POINTER 9
Natz
What's the point of crossing swords 
out in public like this?<PAGE>If you have a problem, you should settle 
it like men, in the Coliseum.<PAGE>If you beat him in battle, not only will 
you resolve your dispute, but your reputation 
will grow, as well. What do you say?

## POINTER 10

Son of a... I don't have time 
for something like that...

## POINTER 11
Natz
Oh? Then I'll use my guild authority 
to have you locked up for disturbance 
of the peace. How does that sound?

## POINTER 12

Damn it...
This isn't worth 
the trouble! Hmpf...

## POINTER 13

Thank you very 
much, Natz.

## POINTER 14
Natz
I don't know what happened here, 
but if you'd fought, you would've 
been given the same punishement.<PAGE>Please, be more careful in the future.

## POINTER 15

Yes...
I-I'm sorry...

## POINTER 16
Natz
Good luck with your business.

## POINTER 17
Natz
Oh... It's you. Hello. I'm still indebted 
to you for everything you've done.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
It looks like things've gotten tough 
in town since Belius passed away.

## POINTER 19
Natz
What happened with the Duce was
unfortunate... But nonetheless.<PAGE>We couldn't go on forever 
depending on her to solve
our problems.<PAGE>This is a town of humans. It's up to us to come together 
and figure out how to live together in peace.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
So you've been going around
as the Duce's temporary
replacement?

## POINTER 21
Natz
Indeed. There will be a vote soon, to determine 
who will officially end up taking her responsibilities...
Who knows how that will turn out.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
I feel like Nordopolica's people have 
already chosen you to lead them. That's 
how it seems to me, at least.

## POINTER 23

Rarr, get outta the way! 
Move, move, move!!

## POINTER 24
Natz
...It never ends...

## POINTER 25
Natz
Stop by again sometime, if you'd like.<PAGE>Maybe we can sit down over 
some tea and share stories.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
Definitely...

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
Wow, he's got it tough...â™ª

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, it can't be easy dealing with 
all these crazies day in and day out.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(JUD)
I hope he hangs in there...
