A dragon came into our city! Do 
you know who he belongs to?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
He's my friend! His 
name is Ba'ul.

## POINTER 2

Cool...<PAGE>He's pretty big, but 
he's still a small fry 
compared to Krones!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Krones? Who's 
that? Where?

## POINTER 4

He's right here, silly! 
Krones is the Entelexeia 
who protects our city!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Ya mean this big 
ol' jellyfish?

## POINTER 6

He's not a jellyfish, 
Mister! Show 
some respect!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Krones is so big! I can't believe 
an entire city could fit 
inside an Entelexeia.

## POINTER 8

Yeah, cool, huh? 
Even your Ball 
can fit inside!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
His name is Ba'ul...

## POINTER 10

Whatever. Who 
cares? Krones 
is way better!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
You know, you've got a pretty 
smart mouth, kid. Just who 
do you think you are?

## POINTER 12

Whaddaya mean? I'm just 
telling the truth.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(JUD), say 
something 
to him!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
All Entelexeia have their roles to 
play. There's no such thing as one 
of them being better than another.

## POINTER 15

Ha! You're just saying that because you don't wanna 
admit that your Entelexeia's already lost!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
Ba'ul hasn't lost anything! 
If you're so eager, let's 
settle this right now!

## POINTER 17

My pleasure! You'd better not 
cry once you get beaten!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(JUD)! Let's do it!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, so I have to back up your challenges? 
What a pain in the rear...

## POINTER 20

We'll compete in a race that I made up! 
Lots of points are floating in the sky, 
and you win by collecting them all!<PAGE>Give it 
your best 
shot!

## POINTER 21

Whaddaya think? 
Cool, huh?<PAGE>That's not all there is, 
either! I've got even better 
courses to show you!
