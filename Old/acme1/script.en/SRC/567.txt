Would you be Rhianna?

## POINTER 1

Yes, I'm Rhianna Kale. 
Who are all of you?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
We've been sent by the Union.

## POINTER 3
Rhianna
So you're the guild members 
who'll look for my mother's 
necklace for me?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
Ah, you poor, beautiful lady. 
You're searching desperately 
for a memento of your mother?

## POINTER 5
Rhianna
That's right. It's the necklace 
that my father gave my mother 
when they got married.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
Oh! The necklace she received 
on her wedding day...! What 
a wonderful story, my sweet.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
It's getting kinda creepy, old man...

## POINTER 8
Rhianna
This necklace is made of a rather 
valuable metal called Everlight.<PAGE>My father mined the ore 
himself and hand-crafted 
it into a necklace.<PAGE>It was truly the only one of its kind...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
So, what sort of identifying features does your necklace have?

## POINTER 10
Rhianna
Everlight is a bright 
red metal.<PAGE>My father made that metal into 
hexagonal links to form a necklace 
and gave it to my mother.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
A necklace of bright red hexagons... 
Quite distinctive.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, that should make it easier to find.<PAGE>So, do you have any idea where 
you might have lost it?

## POINTER 13
Rhianna
Well, actually...
I dropped it into the river from 
the bridge at the entrance to town...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
What...?!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
How are we supposed to find that...?

## POINTER 16
Rhianna
Please! It's extremely 
important to me!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
We can see that, with all 
you've told us, but...<PAGE>What you're asking is impossible.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
But we did tell the Union we'd 
accept the task, after all.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
Any other guild would turn a request 
like this down, once they realized 
they couldn't do it.

## POINTER 20
Rhianna
No...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
No! No, no, NO! Once a guild 
has taken a job, it cannot 
refuse to do it!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
What got into you?!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RAV)
Can't you see that this young 
lady is deeply troubled?<PAGE>What kind of guild would refuse to help 
such a poor, sweet, beautiful girl?<PAGE>We accept this task in the name 
of the brightest star in the 
night sky--Brave Vesperia!

## POINTER 24
Rhianna
Thank you!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(JUD)
And who put you in charge?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
...Oh well. I guess we'll 
go ahead and take care 
of it, right, <STR>(KAR)...?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RIT)
He's gone.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(JUD)
Huh? He was waiting at the entrance 
just a minute ago...

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
That would explain why it's so quiet.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RAP)
*Two barks*

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
Let's go and find him.
