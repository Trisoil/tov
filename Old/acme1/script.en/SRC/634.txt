What's this supposed to be?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Is it a...grave, perhaps?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
A grave? In a place like this?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Actually, this is just the type 
of place I'd expect to see one.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
What do you mean?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
You know, like the grave of 
someone who plotted against 
the empire...and failed.<PAGE>If you wanted to bury somebody and 
keep it quiet, you'd want a place 
like this with no one around.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Huh, wonder if that's what 
I've got in store for me.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Don't say such things...! 
That isn't funny!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
I wasn't exactly kidding.<PAGE>It's just a fact of life that some 
folks from the lower quarter never 
get a funeral or a proper burial.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
What happens to them, then?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
They get cremated and have 
their ashes scattered over a 
river or a field, usually.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
Are you telling the truth...?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
...How did we get started 
talking about this, anyway?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Cause we're trying to figure 
what a lone grave is doing 
in a place like this.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah. So, just who does 
it belong to...?
