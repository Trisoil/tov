Nan...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
Can't sleep, huh...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(JUD)... Why are you 
up? It's so late.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
I was just watching the moon...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
The moon...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
You're worried for that girl?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
...Yeah.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
You're a nice kid, <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
I've...been in so many 
different guilds...<PAGE>But I ended up doing a cruddy job 
in all of them and quitting...<PAGE>So all the guilds 
just gave up on me.<PAGE>But then...Nan...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
She invited you into her guild?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Ah...yeah... But we still haven't 
made up since we got in that fight.<PAGE>I'm sorry... I'm a member of Brave Vesperia 
now. I shouldn't be thinking about all this.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
I don't blame you for it. She's 
important to you, right?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Er...h-how did you...?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
You wouldn't carry around a picture 
of her if she wasn't important.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
You...you knew?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
I've seen you looking at her picture 
with that silly look on your 
face several times now.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Oh...I got a friend of mine from the photography guild 
I used to belong to to take that picture for me.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
A little photography on the sly?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
N-no...I mean, he just happened to take it as she was passing by...<PAGE>I mean... I guess...it works 
out to the same thing.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
What a naughty boy. But...I don't 
think it's all that bad, really.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
Really...? I,
I wonder...<PAGE>Do you think we'll run into her again?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
I'm not sure...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
No, I know we will... I still 
have to make up with her!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(JUD)
Heh heh...good luck with that.<PAGE>Well, I'm going to go to bed. Good night.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
Oh...yeah... Thanks, 
<STR>(JUD).
