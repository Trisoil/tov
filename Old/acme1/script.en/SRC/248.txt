...Oh, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Hey. You're not asleep?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
No... Is something 
the matter?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, I was just trying to think 
of what our next move should be.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes... I didn't even think 
I'd be able to continue 
traveling with you...<PAGE>...I'm still trying to decide if I should.<PAGE>You're really going to put your 
all into this guild, aren't you?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
I'd like to say I'm just gonna go with the 
flow, but I went and bragged to <STR>(FRE) about 
it...I guess I can't slack off, now!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(KAR) certainly seems happy. 
I'm a bit jealous.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Oh ho. Does Her Majesty the Princess 
wish to join our humble guild?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
If I asked you to let me 
in...would you let me in?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
If you've thought about this and it's your 
decision, I won't try to stop you.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Yeah, you're right...I 
should really give this 
some thought.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Well, don't think TOO hard about it.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Hehehe.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
How can I decide...?
