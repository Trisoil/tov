<STR>(YUR)
What is it, <STR>(RAP)...?
...Huh?

## POINTER 2
Ted
Oh, that would be a memory formula.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
A memory formula?

## POINTER 4
Ted

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)

That certainly doesn't 
raise my confidence in this thing.

## POINTER 6
Ted
But everyone's been using this memory 
formula, and it doesn't seem to 
present any sort of danger.<PAGE>Apparently, that mage has been trekking 
across the planet, leaving behind formulas 
like this one all over the place.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
What for?

## POINTER 8
Ted
It seems like the mage wants to 
collect the memories of travelers 
who've journeyed to all sorts of places.<PAGE>They say this formula reads 
in your memories, and then 
they're saved inside it.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm... I don't see what this 
has to do with... Hey, what

to give it a try!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Hey now...
