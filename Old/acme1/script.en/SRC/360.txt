Try not to take too long, okay?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Sure.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
It's completely inactive now... And 
it was overflowing so much before...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Is that how the aer was controlled? How could 
a monster do something like that...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Is that aer krene 
safe now?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
We'll be in trouble if aer shoots 
out of it like before!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
It doesn't look like you 
have to worry about that...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
So why'd the aer suddenly 
shoot out before?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
That's what's puzzling me.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Maybe it was just a natural phenomenon?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
The probability of that is low, at best.<PAGE>If that was the case, it should be 
emitting aer at regular intervals.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
If aer were emitted that frequently, it'd 
have an effect on the environment.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Like how the plants grew so 
unnaturally in Keiv Moc.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
Looks pretty normal 
'round here to me.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
So perhaps something else interfered 
with the aer krene and caused 
it to discharge aer?<PAGE>But what could do that...<PAGE>Only a formula or blastia could 
affect aer like that...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAP)
Grrr.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Damn, that would be our fan club. 
Seems like these knights are just 
as dedicated as the Captain himself.<PAGE><STR>(RIT), let's go. Are you done 
looking at the aer krene?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
Just let me think a little more...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
If you just need time to think, you'll have plenty 
of time once we've gotten out of here!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
Mmm...all right, all right!
