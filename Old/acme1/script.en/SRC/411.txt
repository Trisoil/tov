<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS38_001)Well, he doesn't seem to be 
here. M-maybe he's off 
somewhere taking a nap...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_002)Phaeroh. You are 
here, aren't you?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS38_003)Gyaaah!!

## POINTER 3
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_004)Insipid poison, you appear 
before me at last!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_005)...So you are here. Is that how 
you greet all your guests, 
Phaeroh? By calling them names?

## POINTER 5
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_006)For what reason have you come to me?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_007)Surely you are aware that 
I could end your existence 
with a mere thought.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_008)Heh. You talk pretty 
big, don't you?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_009)If you really want a fight, 
I'd hate to disappoint you.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_010)<STR>(YUR), no! 
Everyone, please wait!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS38_011)<STR>(EST_P)!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_012)Phaeroh, please hear 
what I have to say!

## POINTER 10
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_013)Does death hold no fear for 
you, little one? For you gaze now 
into the mouth of death itself.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_014)I am afraid. But I'm even 
more afraid of dying without 
knowing who I really am.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_015)Belius told me I needed to meet 
you to learn about my destiny.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_016)I have to know just 
what that destiny is.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_017)I understand that I am a threat to 
the Entelexeia. But you said that 
I am a poison to this world...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_018)What is this power I 
have? Just who is the 
Child of the Full Moon?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_019)If it is true that my existence 
cannot be tolerated...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_020)Then it's okay if I have to die.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_021)But I at least 
deserve to know why 
it is I have to die!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_022)Please tell me! 
I beg of you!

## POINTER 13
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_023)There was a time when this 
was a verdant land sheltered 
by the blessing of an aer krene.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS38_024)So there was an aer 
krene here...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_025)But what happened? 
Why did it change?

## POINTER 16
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_026)What you see are the results of 
too much aer and its aftermath.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_027)As to why the aer ran rampant... The 
answer lies with the poison brought 
by the Child of the Full Moon.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_028)Huh...?

## POINTER 18
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_029)The power of the Child of the 
Full Moon stimulates the aer 
krene more than any blastia.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_030)Huh?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS38_031)...Blastia convert aer into 
energy by way of a formula.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_032)So if <STR>(EST_P) can use 
her healing artes without 
the aid of any blastia...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_033)She must possess a formula 
in her very being that lets 
her convert aer into energy.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_034)<STR>(JUD) was searching for blastia that 
used a particular kind of formula...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_035)So...this special formula 
<STR>(EST_P) has must also consume 
massive amounts of aer...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_036)Which causes the aer krene to 
become more active and pump 
out more aer than they should...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_037)I had hoped my 
hypothesis...would 
have been wrong...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_038)Then, I...

## POINTER 22
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_039)It is as she has said...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_040)With each use of her power, 
the Child of the Full Moon uses 
far more aer than the blastia...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_041)In so doing, the 
imbalance of aer in 
this world is furthered.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_042)For the planet, such an existence 
can only be called a poison.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_043)So you just wipe it out, 
then? A little quick to 
judge, aren't you, Phaeroh?

## POINTER 24
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_044)This problem concerns the entire 
planet, and she is its cause. To do 
nothing would be unparalleled folly.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_045)If the problem's with <STR>(EST_P), 
then it's for us to solve.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_046)You have no place in our affairs.

## POINTER 26
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_047)The gravity of this situation 
is beyond your grasp.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_048)You don't honestly think that 
everything's gonna be all sunshine 
and rainbows if <STR>(EST_P) dies, do you?

## POINTER 28
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_049)It would at least eliminate 
one problem.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_050)Phaeroh, at Heliord I stopped 
myself, and again at 
Dahngrest I stopped you.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_051)What I thought was a blastia 
turned out to be a human. Before 
I realized it, I had lost my way.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_052)I never thought this child could be 
as great a danger as you had said.

## POINTER 30
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_053)And due to your confusion, I 
granted you the time necessary 
to see things as they are.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_054)As a result, my sister Belius 
is now lost to me. Enough. 
This power will bring only ruin.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS38_055)Hmm, not sure I understand all this, 
but if her power's the problem, why 
can't she just not use it?

## POINTER 32
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_056)There can be no guarantee she 
will not try to use the power.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_057)...That's true. She does have 
trouble turning a blind eye to 
things happening around her.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_058)Someday she will surely use 
her power to help someone.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_059)However, as long as she keeps 
that spirit of compassion, she 
cannot only be seen as harmful.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_060)She is not like a blastia. 
I know that you can 
feel the difference.

## POINTER 35
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_061)...Compassion alone will not save this world.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_062)Listen, Phaeroh. I get that you've 
thought all this through with 
everybody's best interest in mind.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_063)But why doesn't that world 
have a place for <STR>(EST_P)?

## POINTER 37
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_064)It is sometimes 
necessary to remove a 
part to save the whole.

## POINTER 38
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_065)I don't buy that for a second.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_066)What makes you so high and mighty 
that you're the one to decide who 
gets cut and who doesn't?

## POINTER 39
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_067)We have endured the anxiety of 
existence for far greater a span 
than you can conceive.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_068)Such words mean nothing from 
those who call this world home 
for but a fleeting moment!

## POINTER 40
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_069)Phaeroh, please listen.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_070)The important thing is 
finding a way to stop the 
excessive aer, correct?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_071)We still have time left to 
search for such a thing.

## POINTER 41
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_072)<STR>(JUD)...

## POINTER 42
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_073)And if...if the effects 
of <STR>(EST_P)'s power reach 
their absolute limit...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_074)I will kill her as promised.

## POINTER 43
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_075)You should have no complaint with this.

## POINTER 44
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS38_076)H-hey <STR>(JUD), 
are you serious?!

## POINTER 45
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_077)I'm sure Brave Vesperia will 
come up with something 
before that happens, right?

## POINTER 46
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS38_078)What?! I...um... Yeah, 
yeah of course we will!

## POINTER 47
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_079)Score one for <STR>(JUD).<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_080)So that settles it.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_081)If we humans are to blame for <STR>(EST_P)'s 
problem and bringing on the apocalypse, 
then it's up to us to make things right.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_082)If we give it all we've got and 
still blow it, you can slow 
roast us on a grill for all I care.

## POINTER 48
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_083)...You have changed. If you 
were still as before...

## POINTER 49
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_084)Have I?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_085)That is nice to hear.

## POINTER 50
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_086)...Very well. Be ever mindful 
though, that time is fleeting!

## POINTER 51
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS38_087)Wait!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_088)If the formulas are causing 
the excessive aer...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_089)Then there must've 
been times when this 
happened in the past.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_090)I mean, the blastia 
were a product of 
an ancient civilization.

## POINTER 52
Phaeroh
<VOICE>(VS38_091)There exist those 
who have inherited 
the sins of the past.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_092)If any yet can speak of 
what occurred in the 
days of old, it is they.

## POINTER 53
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS38_093)He's gone...

## POINTER 54
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_094)Umm, I... Thanks for 
everything, <STR>(YUR).<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_095)<STR>(JUD)...you, too.

## POINTER 55
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_096)No problem, but hey...

## POINTER 56
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_097)What?

## POINTER 57
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_098)"It's okay if I have to die"?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_099)What the hell was that?

## POINTER 58
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_100)...I'm sorry.

## POINTER 59
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_101)I don't want to hear that again.

## POINTER 60
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_102)I'm sorry...
