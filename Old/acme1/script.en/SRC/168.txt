You're looking chipper as always, <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 1
<STR>(FRE)
I've got a lot on my mind, <STR>(YUR). Not 
that you'd know what that's like.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Hmph...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(FRE)
Manage to go out and 
get your bounty raised 
even higher?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
I thought you went to 
the magistrate's place.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(FRE)
I went. Along with a search warrant 
from the blastia research lab.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Ah, so you were able to go 
inside and look around.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(FRE)
Nope... The magistrate 
refused us entry.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Why?!

## POINTER 9
Witcher
He even tried to provoke us. "If you 
really think I have blastia, try to 
bust your way in," he said.

## POINTER 10
Sodia
He knows we don't have the jurisdiction
to do that--he's just making a mockery of us!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Well, isn't 
he right?

## POINTER 12
Sodia
What did you say?!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(YUR), whose side are you on?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
It's not a matter of whose side I'm on. If you think 
you're right, you should force your way inside.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(FRE)
No, it's a trap.<PAGE>Ragou wants the Imperial Guard to make a mistake so he can use 
it as an excuse to increase the authority of the Council.<PAGE>If we go in now, he'll 
hide the evidence and 
feign innocence.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
Is Magistrate Ragou on 
the Council as well?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(FRE)
Yes.<PAGE>The Imperial Knights and the Council are both essential 
organizations that support the empire.<PAGE>But Ragou seems to have 
forgotten this fact.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
So in short, we're not dealing with your 
everyday magistrate here. Well, have you 
got a plan for what you're doing next?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(FRE)
...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
What, you're out of ideas?

## POINTER 21
Witcher
...If there were some sort of disturbance inside the 
palace, the Imperial Knights would be able to move 
in under the pretense of emergency prerogative.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
Ah yes... "The Imperial Knights may employ emergency 
prerogative to intervene in emergency situations, 
regardless of jurisdiction."

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Of course! So if a thief snuck in and 
caused a ruckus that'd be enough?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(FRE)
<STR>(YUR), I know you want 
to help, but...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
...But I shouldn't do anything reckless, right?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(FRE)
I'm going to go patrol the town. I've just received 
a tip that a fugitive with a warrant out for his arrest 
is trying to get into the magistrate's palace.
