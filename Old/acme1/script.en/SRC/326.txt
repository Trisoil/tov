Yeah, thanks for the help.

## POINTER 1

Umm...I don't know your reasons for 
going out into the desert, but...<PAGE>It would really be a good idea 
for you to stay in town...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Thanks, but we've already 
put a lot of thought 
into it.

## POINTER 3

I see. Well, as 
I promised...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Our canteens are this small?!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Looks like enough to me.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
Yeah, we should be able to get 
more water from certain types of 
cacti growing in the desert.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Right, if we use them to fill up our canteens 
whenever we need more water, we should 
be fine. You sure know a lot.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
Thank you very much. You've 
been a great help.

## POINTER 9

It's the least I could do. I'm giving 
that to you, so don't hesitate to 
use it as much as you like.<PAGE>Go out and turn right where the 
road forks. You'll find a lake 
at the end of the road.<PAGE>You'll be able to 
fill up your canteens 
there.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Gotcha.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
By the way, what was with 
the knight who was here?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
He was guarding me all night. 
I was so nervous!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
One lie after another...

## POINTER 14

...That was a supervisor. The knights are here 
to make sure that townspeople don't talk freely 
to visitors from outside of town.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
Why would they do something like that?

## POINTER 16

I don't understand the reasons, but it's on the 
magistrate's orders. People other than merchants 
like myself aren't allowed out of their houses.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
I see... That's why 
we didn't see any townspeople 
outside.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
I wonder if there's a crooked 
magistrate here, too.

## POINTER 19

There was no magistrate in this 
town until recently, and then 
finally he arrived...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
Really?

## POINTER 21

Yes.<PAGE>The Imperial Knights have started 
to move into Nordopolica of late.<PAGE>It seems they may've already 
gone in to arrest Belius.<PAGE>The appointment of a new imperial 
magistrate to our town seems to 
be related to that, as well.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
The Imperial Knights are 
going to arrest Belius?!

## POINTER 23

They say that Belius had something 
to do with engineering the Great 
War behind the scenes.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
Belius did that...?!

## POINTER 25

That's what they're saying in town.<PAGE>Well, I don't think the empire 
will be able to do much so long 
as Palestralle's there, but...

## POINTER 26

...

## POINTER 27

Thank you very much for your business!

## POINTER 28
<STR>(KAR)
Wait...but...

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, thanks for the help.<PAGE>Let's go fill up at the lake.
