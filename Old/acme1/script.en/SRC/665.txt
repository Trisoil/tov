What the... There 
are Krityans here?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
I wonder what they're doing 
in a place like this?

## POINTER 2

Hey, it's you.<PAGE>We heard that Myorzo's days of floating in 
the sky might soon be over, so we've been 
scoping out places to live on the surface.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
You're already planning a new place to live...?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
I don't think you need 
to rush or anything.<PAGE>After all, Krones still hasn't made the decision 
whether or not to turn into an elemental spirit.<PAGE>And our goal was to gather 
together the Four Elementals, 
which we're already done.

## POINTER 5

I see...what should 
we do, then?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
I think you have to figure 
that out for yourself.<PAGE>But perhaps it would be a good 
idea to use the knowledge of the 
Kritya to help people in need?

## POINTER 7

Hmmm...that sounds hard.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
I don't think it does at all...

## POINTER 9

I don't suppose something like this 
would be of much use to anyone...

## POINTER 10

There's no way anyone would be able to 
use an arcane spear arte like this...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
Could I see that?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
For a race that's mostly pacifists, the 
Kritya certainly have a lot of artifacts 
related to fighting, don't they?

## POINTER 13

It's possible that our people came 
up with them back when we fought the 
Adephagos, a thousand years ago.<PAGE>There are many artes that our own people do 
not use...perhaps we only worked out the 
theory, but never put them into practice.

## POINTER 14

Wow, amazing. For 
a Krityan, you are 
very skilled.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
...I think this could come in handy.

## POINTER 16

I see. We cannot lend you our force in battle, 
so we shall lend you our wisdom.<PAGE>We're happy to do whatever we can if it will help you in your quest.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
Thank you. Keep 
up the good work.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Hey...that strike arte that you did just now was really...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
...Basic? Yes, I was just beating 
my spear hard against the ground.<PAGE>There's a trick to it, but it's 
not really that hard to do.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
It looks like they never tried 
to do it themselves.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
The Krityan people could do things 
like this if they tried.<PAGE>Then they'd discover all sorts of new 
abilities they didn't know they had.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Like you, <STR>(JUD)?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(JUD)
Hee hee. Exactly!
