Wow, this place 
is crazy...

## POINTER 1
Kaufman
I guess I should've 
known I might run 
into you here.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Are you here on some 
business with Fortune's 
Market?

## POINTER 3
Kaufman
Unfortunately, not quite. I just learned 
of this island, so I decided to 
come and have a look around.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
So have ya figured out what 
sorta place this is yet?

## POINTER 5
Kaufman
It's a kind of...playground. A paradise where 
people can come to forget the troubles of 
their day-to-day lives and just have fun.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
It doesn't look 
that way to me--

## POINTER 7
Kaufman
See for yourself. I think 
you'll see what I mean.<PAGE>You can exchange your Gald for 
chips here. You might as well 
do it sooner rather than later.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, we'll do that.

## POINTER 9
Kaufman
Well, have a good time. 
I'll talk to you later.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
So then, you want 
to try exchanging 
our Gald for chips?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, good idea.
