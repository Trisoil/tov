I'd like to pass, 
if I could.

## POINTER 1

Sorry, no can do, buddy. 
The laborers camp ahead 
is too dangerous.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Hmph...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Thank goodness... Knowing you, <STR>(YUR), 
I thought for sure you'd try to 
force your way through...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Well, "proceed with caution," and 
all that. Boss's orders, y'know.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
But how should we 
get by the guard?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
I really think forcing our way through would 
be the simplest and most effective way in.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
No, I won't allow it!<PAGE>All we need to do is draw the 
guard away from his post.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
But how will we do that?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
...Maybe by, y'know, seducing him with feminine wiles?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Well then...

## POINTER 11
Have someone distract the guards?
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(JUD)
<STR>(KAR)

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(EST_P), you up for it?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Huh? M-me? N-not 
a chance!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Not a chance, huh? Yeah, I guess 
you're not too sexy anyway.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
Erk...I'm sexy enough, 
thank you very much!<PAGE>...Want me to prove it?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Sure.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
Now, let's go look for something 
to get that guard drooling.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
Thanks!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
You're certainly persuasive.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, she's just easily 
persuaded.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
That's for sure.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Well, <STR>(JUD), you're probably the best choice.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(JUD)
Yes, I think so.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
Aren't you sure of yourself!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(JUD)
Well then, shall we?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(EST_P)
Where are we going?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
To buy a dress, 
of course.<PAGE>I can't seduce 
anyone in these 
rags!

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Isn't what you're wearing good enough?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(JUD)
No, no, my pride would never allow it.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
I don't really understand, but she 
appears to be going to buy a dress.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(KAR)
So she's going 
to see the peddler, 
then.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(KAR) should be good for the job.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(KAR)
Wh-what are you talking 
about?! Why me?!

## POINTER 34
<STR>(JUD)
That sounds good to me.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(KAR)
Ah ha ha, so you're in on 
the joke too, <STR>(JUD)?

## POINTER 36
<STR>(JUD)
Nah, I'm not really one for jokes.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(KAR)
Huh...?

## POINTER 38
<STR>(YUR)
Okay, let's go.

## POINTER 39
<STR>(JUD)
You've gotta believe in yourself, <STR>(KAR)!<PAGE>When a lady struts her stuff, she does it with pizzazz!

## POINTER 40
<STR>(KAR)
I don't have any idea what you're talking about!
