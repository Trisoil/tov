<STR>(YUR)
Oh, so both of you were 
here the whole time!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(FRE)
<STR>(YUR), please watch your speech 
in front of His Royal Highness.<PAGE>You could at least show due courtesy to 
the gracious pardoner of your crimes.

## POINTER 2
Ioder
It's okay, <STR>(FRE). Miss 
<STR>(EST) and I acted 
of our own volition.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(FRE)
You've already heard about Princess 
<STR>(EST) then, I see.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I heard.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(FRE)
<STR>(YUR), I thought that traveling 
with you would be to Her Highness' 
own benefit, but...

## POINTER 6
Ioder
The royal family can't be allowed to romp all 
over the countryside without restraint.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
That's not very convincing, 
coming from you.

## POINTER 8
Ioder
Haha, I apologize. But now especially, it's 
undesirable for the royal family's concerns 
to be brought into the public eye.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Concerns? You mean whether you 
or the Princess is next in line 
for the imperial throne?

## POINTER 10
Ioder
Correct. There are currently two opinions, that of 
the Imperial Knights, and that of the Council.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(FRE)
Your Highness!

## POINTER 12
Ioder
There's no use hiding any details from 
him when he already knows so much.

## POINTER 13
Ioder
The Imperial Knights are backing 
my own ascension to the throne.<PAGE>Meanwhile, Miss <STR>(EST) has 
the support of the Council.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
She's a princess, after all.

## POINTER 15
Ioder
Yes, her relation may be a 
distant one, but she's unmistakably 
of royal blood.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
That's gotta be tough for the Knights, too.<PAGE>Even if she's the rival of their candidate 
for the throne, it's not like they can just 
stop protecting the Princess, is it?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(FRE)
<STR>(YUR), this matter is...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
I don't know anyone odd enough to be 
interested in information like this.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Well, I'm going to go drop by <STR>(EST_P)'s 
place, and then I'm gonna take a load 
off at the inn. Thanks for the chat.
