The city streets may look nice, but people's 
lives are the same everywhere.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
What're you doing awake this late at night?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
I couldn't sleep. I kept hearing 
noise from outside...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Even at this late hour, everyone's 
still hard at work.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Well, I don't think they're doing 
it because they enjoy it.<PAGE>But if they don't keep working, they 
won't be able to make a living.<PAGE>And even with all this work, they're 
hardly able to get by.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
...That's terrible...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Are you all right?

## POINTER 8

You're a noble, aren't 
you? Stay away from me!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
They've just learned to distrust 
nobles and the empire.<PAGE>It's nothing personal 
against you, <STR>(EST_P).<PAGE>Try not to let it bother you too much.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
I wonder if it's something that can be changed...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
I dunno... It's not easy. For 
his part, <STR>(FRE)'s trying his 
hardest to change things.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
......

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Let's go back and get some rest.
