## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS55_088)Yes. I can't really explain it, 
but she is here. I can sense it.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS55_089)Well, she was created through <STR>(EST_P), 
so maybe the two are connected.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS55_090)Very interesting...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS55_091)Hey, save the research for later, okay?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)

could eat the whole world.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS55_100)What are we supposed to do 
about something like that?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS55_101)Hey, <STR>(RIT). Duke said 
the Adephagos was 
born from aer.

## POINTER 14

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS55_103)So if the spirits convert 
aer into matter...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS55_104)Could we do something about the Adephagos

<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS55_105)I don't know.,, I just...I don't know.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS55_106)But...I do think
