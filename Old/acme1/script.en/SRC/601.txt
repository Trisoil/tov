Markham
That was fast. Have 
you found it already?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
No, um... We actually didn't 
see it down there...

## POINTER 2
Markham
...So then, someone else 
must have run off with 
it... Oh dear...

## POINTER 3
Joshua
Come on Mark, keep your chin up.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
...We're um, really sorry...

## POINTER 5
Markham
No need to apologize... If it's anyone's 
fault, it's mine for leaving 
it there in the first place.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
…………

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Um... We could look a little 
more if you'd like...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
Whoa, hold your horses, tiger.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
There might just be a clue 
or two that we missed...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
Not you too, <STR>(RIT) Chiquita.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
I'm sorry I said you were 
talking nonsense earlier.<PAGE>I didn't realize your 
shovel really meant 
that much to you.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Do you really think there'll be 
some sort of clue down there...?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
Um, hello. That's what I'm sayin.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
...On the other hand, there's no 
guarantee we'll come up empty-handed 
if we take another look.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
Now, hold on...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
Well I suppose that 
chance is good enough 
for me. I'm in.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
I-I'll come along too...

## POINTER 18
Joshua
Oh, Mark. Mark, did you hear? 
These people are going 
to continue the search.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
We will have to nudge our payment up 
just a touch, in exchange, though.♪

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(KAR) doesn't miss a beat, does he?

## POINTER 21
Markham
Thank you...but I'm afraid your willingness 
to help is more than enough.

## POINTER 22
Joshua
But Mark... 
Why?

## POINTER 23
Markham
I was pleasantly surprised to find 
people who understood just how important 
that shovel was to me. <PAGE>And in the guilds, when 
a job's been done, that's 
the end of it.<PAGE>We in Ruins' Gate take no exception to that rule.

## POINTER 24
Joshua
Yeah...

## POINTER 25
Markham
You gave it your best shot. I've got 
no trouble paying you for your time.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(KAR)
Really...?

## POINTER 27
Markham
It's only natural.

## POINTER 28
Markham
I'll have to bid farewell to my old 
friend, and go find myself a new one.

## POINTER 29
Joshua
That's it, that's the ticket, Mark. 
Well then, we should be moving on...

## POINTER 30
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, wait a moment... Are 
you familiar with a 
Mr. or Miss Harmfall?

## POINTER 31
Markham
Harmfall...<PAGE>...You mean MY Harmfall?

## POINTER 32
<STR>(KAR)
Your...?

## POINTER 33
<STR>(EST_P)
Maybe you misunderstood me...

## POINTER 34
Markham
Harmfall! So 
you were okay 
after all...

## POINTER 35
<STR>(KAR)
Huh...?

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
Hold on...you don't mean...

## POINTER 37
Joshua
Yes, this is the Harmfall, a 
legendary shovel that's been in 
his family for generations.<PAGE>Oh, luck was with us today.

## POINTER 38
<STR>(KAR)
So then, that name written 
on the handle is the 
shovel's name?

## POINTER 39
<STR>(RIT)
...I guess.
