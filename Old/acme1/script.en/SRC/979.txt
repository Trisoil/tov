Hey, <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
...Oh... <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Is that...what you were going 
to give us as payment...?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, it's a memento of my mother.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Your mom... She 
passed away?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, when I was still a child.<PAGE>...What about your mother, <STR>(YUR)...?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
It happened when I was a baby. I don't 
even remember what she looked like.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
I see...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
I thought that I was special, to never have 
a father or mother while I was growing up.<PAGE>But you, and <STR>(KAR), and even <STR>(RIT)...you 
all grew up by yourselves, too.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Well, in my case, everyone in the 
lower quarter helped raise me.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Everyone in the castle helped 
to raise me, too.<PAGE>But I still felt lonely sometimes. Whenever that happened, 
I would look at this memento and think of my mother. 
It helped bring my spirits up a little.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
What're you doing trying to give 
away something so important to 
you? You should keep it safe!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
After I started this journey, I completely 
forgot about the memento of my mother.<PAGE>I think, because I was 
with you, <STR>(YUR)...<PAGE>I didn't need it anymore...
I had stopped getting lonely...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
...Are you going to get rid of it...?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
We all have to leave our old memories 
behind. Everyone else is living fiercely 
and not worrying about the past.<PAGE>I need to learn how to grow 
up and move on, too.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
If you don't want it, let 
me hold onto it for you.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
The time will come when you're going to need it. 
You're going to want to reevaluate who you are.<PAGE>You'll need it to remind yourself who 
you were, and how far you've come.<PAGE>You don't want to make any rash decisions 
now that you'll regret later.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
Maybe...you're 
right...<PAGE>But until then, please take 
care of it for me, <STR>(YUR).<PAGE>If I lose sight of where 
I'm going, I may have 
to fall back on it.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
There'd be nothing wrong with that, either...
