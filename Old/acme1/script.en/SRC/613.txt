Welcome to the Galactic Gearbox 
shop. What sort of trinket 
are you in the market for?

## POINTER 1

We've got some dazzling 
earrings made with the 
finest silver. Step right up!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
You don't have much in the way 
of weapons and armor, do you?

## POINTER 3

Fraid not, ma'am.
We focus on aesthetics here. â™ª

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
We didn't exactly come 
here to go shopping.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
Heh, that's right. I'd 
almost forgotten.

## POINTER 6

Well, if you're not here to shop, 
what is it we can help you with?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
We're actually wondering if you 
can shed some light on the 
method for refining Everlight.

## POINTER 8

Hey, you think he means that 
stuff Kale had written down 
in that old book of his?

## POINTER 9

That would be my best guess.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
That's it...! That's what 
Nobis is looking for...

## POINTER 11

I dunno what we'd have done 
without that old book.

## POINTER 12

Processing Everlight is a pretty 
tricky business, you see.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Would you consider lending it to 
us? We could even make a copy for 
ourselves if it isn't too long.

## POINTER 14

Problem is, we don't 
have it anymore.

## POINTER 15

The Imperial Knights came 
some time ago, and took it 
with them when they left.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
The Imperial Knights?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
Whoa, hold on. I'm bein' 
framed, framed I tell ya!<PAGE>You happen ta hear what this group 
of knights called themselves?

## POINTER 18

Wasn't it somethin' like 
the Cumore brigade?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
...Cumore...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
...Never thought we'd be hearing 
that name all the way out here.

## POINTER 21

Yeah, he snatched that book right 
up. Called it "heretical." 'Course 
he was just feedin' us a line.

## POINTER 22

You should have seen his face light 
up when he first heard us mention it.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
He must have seen it as a 
sure-fire way to start making 
some heavy weaponry.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
It's the no-talent hacks that 
always seem obsessed with 
making the biggest toys.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(KAR)
Well, what now...? If Cumore 
took it with him, then...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
I'd imagine the Knights'd 
keep a pretty close eye on 
the stuff they confiscate.<PAGE>Not too familiar with the 
protocol myself, though.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(EST_P)
Why don't we try 
asking <STR>(FRE)?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Maybe that's our safest bet if 
the old man here can't help us.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
Looks like we're 
headed to Aurnion.
