We've no choice but to go out through the harbor, then.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
But what if the harbor's blockaded, too?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Well, the Weasand of 
Cados is blocked off.<PAGE>If we have to get out of here, I'd say breaking 
out through the harbor is our best bet!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Ah, escaping by sea might 
be better, yes.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Exactly.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, where's the old man...?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
You don't need to worry 
about him. He'll turn 
up soon enough.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
Right. He's the sort of guy who shows up as soon 
as you start to feel relieved he's gone.

<STR>(EST_P)'s not going back with you!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
All right, let's hurry to the harbor!
