Are you thinking about <STR>(JUD_P)?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah. I'm wondering what we should do about her.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
It's true that she broke 
the guild's laws and 
betrayed us.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
I always thought that a guild's 
strict adherence to its own 
laws was what kept it together.<PAGE>That there could be no exceptions... no lenience
for those who would break the laws.<PAGE>But...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
She did what she did to save the world.<PAGE><STR>(JUD) is destroying blastia because she knows it's the 
right thing to do, even if it makes people hate her.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Yup...<PAGE><STR>(JUD) didn't break 
our laws in order to 
do something bad.<PAGE>I know this, now.<PAGE>I'm going to talk with her about 
it and give it some more thought. 
I'll figure this out eventually.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Oh yeah?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Maybe if I become a little bit more decisive, 
Nan will listen to me, too...
