Darn it. I'm in a real pickle now...

## POINTER 1

You got a look at them, though, didn't 
you? The one that stole the boat...

## POINTER 2

Oh I saw 'im all right. He was carryin' 
this big ol' black bag, and 
he was dressed like a butler.

## POINTER 3

Well, why didn't you get another boat, 
and take off after him, then?<PAGE>Oh phooey, you're just hopeless...

## POINTER 4

Someone dressed like a butler... 
Could it be Sebastian?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Looks like he got out onto the ocean.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah, but where exactly? The ocean's a 
pretty good hiding place. It's huge!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
That's right. I wonder if we'll be able to find him.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
We're always one step behind him...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Who knew lookin' for old Nobi's little 
manual was gonna be this tough...?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
For real... If only he'd just 
stay put for a while.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
It might not get us anywhere, but we'd better set 
sail and see if we can't find this boat he's taken.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, I agree.
