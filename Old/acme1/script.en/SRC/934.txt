<STR>(RIT)
What now, 
kid? Admit 
defeat!

## POINTER 2

No way! I've 
still got more 
for you!

## POINTER 3

know when ta give up!

## POINTER 4

is for you.

<STR>(EST_P)
What's 
this?

## POINTER 9

It's condensed dew from Krones's

it to Ball to drink.

It's Ba'ul.

What'll happen when

If your dragon is weak against 
the cold, drinking that will 
make him strong against it!<PAGE>He'll be able to land on 
top of ice drifts, too.

<STR>(JUD)
Wow! You don't mind giving 
us something so useful?

## POINTER 14

Just don't go off running 
away because you 
got a nice prize!<PAGE>Cause I'm going to 
make you an even 
harder course!

worst!

go-between, again?
