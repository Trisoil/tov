Barbos! What is the 
meaning of this!

## POINTER 1
Barbos
I haven't the slightest idea 
what you're talking about.

## POINTER 2
Ragou
The tower and the blastia, of course! I have 
yet to receive any reports about them!

## POINTER 3
Barbos
Why should I have to report to 
you about something like that?

## POINTER 4
Ragou
Wh-what?! Building that lousy tower 
fortress of yours without speaking a 
word of it to your own employer... <PAGE>You even went so far as to use 
Leviathan's Claw for help!

## POINTER 5
Barbos
I'm not your lapdog, 
Ragou.<PAGE>I just gathered the cores together, 
like you requested.<PAGE>It's thanks to my efforts that 
you were able to make that 
weather-controlling blastia.

## POINTER 6
Ragou
And just what made you think it was 
okay to carry off the extra cores?!

## POINTER 7
Barbos
Our mutual non-interference was a condition 
of our agreement, was it not?

## POINTER 8
Ragou
Wh-what...!

## POINTER 9
Barbos
And did I ever interfere 
with what you were doing?

## POINTER 10
Ragou
...Barbos, how dare you!

## POINTER 11
Barbos
You will leave now, magistrate.

## POINTER 12
Ragou
Remember this, Barbos! Black-hearted 
filth like you always get what 
they deserve in the end!

## POINTER 13
Barbos
You're one to talk, Ragou.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Y-you guys!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
It's the world series of villains and you 
had to take the best seat in the house?

## POINTER 16
Barbos
What fool would dare to heckle 
my exquisite performance?

## POINTER 17
Barbos
Oh ho, if it isn't the little runts I met on the ship.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
You're the one who's been causing 
all of the recent chaos!

## POINTER 19
Barbos
And what of it? You 
fools will never manage 
to capture me.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Oh yeah? What's your reasoning there?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
A villain is someone who never considers losing a 
possibility. That's why he thinks the way he does.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
If so, then that makes you quite a villain, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Yep. I'm nefarious.

## POINTER 24
Barbos
You've got a big mouth, brat.

## POINTER 25
Barbos
You would dare to oppose me? I thought 
I told you before that next time you 
wouldn't get off so easy.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
All the better for us 
to tear things up!

## POINTER 27
Barbos
Take them down!

## POINTER 28
Barbos
Haha, the fools have started to march!<PAGE>Now that meddlesome Don 
and the Knights will destroy 
each other!

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
He did this to destroy the Union 
and to eliminate the Don...!

## POINTER 30
<STR>(EST_P)
If the Knights are destroyed, 
who will protect the empire?<PAGE>Ragou, why would you...oh!

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RIT)
Of course...he's going to weaken the 
Imperial Knights so that the Council 
can step in and control the empire.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh my...

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
The Knights and the Union going down 
together...it's just as <STR>(FRE) said.

## POINTER 34
Barbos
Hmph, so what if you know now? 
No matter what you do, you won't 
be able to stop the battle!

## POINTER 35
<STR>(YUR)
Hmm, we'll see.

## POINTER 36
Barbos
And your existence comes 
to an end here!

## POINTER 37
<STR>(YUR)
Damn it, he's too late!

## POINTER 38
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(FRE)?!

## POINTER 39
<STR>(FRE)
Stop! All of you, sheathe 
your blades! Sheathe them!

## POINTER 40
<STR>(FRE)
I am <STR>(FRE) Scifo of the Imperial 
Knights. I have come bearing a 
letter from Master Ioder!

## POINTER 41
<STR>(FRE)
The letter you received from the empire 
was false! It was the work of a rebel! 
Draw back your armies at once!

## POINTER 42
Don Whitehorse
I thought you weren't 
coming back.

## POINTER 43
<STR>(FRE)
And leave <STR>(YUR) behind to take the fall 
for me? I wouldn't dream of it.

## POINTER 44
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS20_113)Ragou, you fool. You didn't keep 
up your end of the bargain.

## POINTER 45
Ragou
<VOICE>(VS20_114)Don't hurt me...!

## POINTER 46
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS20_115)Damn...!

## POINTER 47
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS20_116)<STR>(YUR)! They're aiming 
at <STR>(FRE)!

## POINTER 48
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS20_117)Got 'im!

## POINTER 49
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_118)Nice shot, <STR>(KAR)!

## POINTER 50
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS20_119)You brats think you 
can stop me?!

## POINTER 51
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS20_120)Gyaaah!

## POINTER 52
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS20_121)Aaah!

## POINTER 53
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_122)Get out of here. 
Head for the exit.

## POINTER 54
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS20_123)<STR>(YUR), no, it's too dangerous!

## POINTER 55
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS20_124)It should take time for the 
aer to recharge. I'll try and 
stop him before then...

## POINTER 56
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS20_125)Now!

## POINTER 57
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS20_126)You're too late!

## POINTER 58
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS20_127)No! It charged 
up too quickly!

## POINTER 59
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS20_128)Wh-what the hell...?!

## POINTER 60
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS20_129)Oh, so you're back 
for more, dragon freak!

## POINTER 61
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_130)<STR>(RIT), knock it off! Our 
enemy's over there...!

## POINTER 62
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS20_131)My enemy is this dragon freak!

## POINTER 63
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_132)Leave it alone for now!

## POINTER 64
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS20_133)Humph.

## POINTER 65
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS20_134)I'm gonna make you wish 
you hadn't done that!

## POINTER 66
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS20_135)What? He can fly?!

## POINTER 67
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS20_136)Ah! Get back here you freak! Think 
I'm just gonna let you get away?!

## POINTER 68
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_137)If you're going after him, let me come with you! 
We're a little short on wings around here.

## POINTER 69
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS20_138)Are you crazy? 
This jerk's our enemy!

## POINTER 70
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_139)No matter what happens, 
I've gotta catch that guy.

## POINTER 71
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_140)...Come on!

## POINTER 72
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_141)Yes! Thanks!

## POINTER 73
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS20_142)Wait! What about us...?!

## POINTER 74
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_143)This guy's overloaded 
enough as it is!

## POINTER 75
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS20_144)But, what should we...?

## POINTER 76
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_145)You guys hold down the fort here!

## POINTER 77
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS20_146)What...?!

## POINTER 78
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_147)Stay out of trouble!

## POINTER 79
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS20_148)Dammit, <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 80
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_149)And let <STR>(FRE) know 
I'm stepping out 
for a while!
