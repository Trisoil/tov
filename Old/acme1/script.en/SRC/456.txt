Y-your Excellency, it's horrible! 
The road, the road...is gone!

?!

## POINTER 2

...There's a giant hole on the 
other side of Ehmead Hill.<PAGE>It's burning hot all around it. 
I wasn't able to get very close.

## POINTER 3

What? Just like that? 
I suppose that was what 
all that rumbling was earlier...

## POINTER 4

Even if we were able to get 
near that hole, getting across 
it would be impossible...<PAGE>No one will be able to go past 
Ehmead Hill like this!

## POINTER 5

So then, Nor is cut off 
from everyone else?

## POINTER 6

This is bad. This is real bad.

Could this be...the blast 
from the Heracles' cannon? 
What have they done...?
