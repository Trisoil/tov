<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS25_500)Oh, Ioder...

## POINTER 1
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS25_501)Oh... It's you all.
We meet again.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_502)So what's a successor to the imperial 
throne doing in a place like this?

## POINTER 3
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS25_503)I've been working with 
the Don to officially seal 
our treaty of friendship.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS25_504)Is it going well?

## POINTER 5
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS25_505)Well...I wish I could say 
it were going better.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS25_506)I can imagine.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS25_507)That Heracles monstrosity 
kinda made the Union 
really not like the empire.

## POINTER 7
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS25_508)Yes, and now, prominent members 
of the empire are voicing their 
doubts regarding the friendship treaty.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS25_509)The conditions the Don 
gave the empire were for a 
treaty of equality, after all.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS25_510)And they are certainly 
not on equal footing 
with something like that.

## POINTER 10
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS25_511)Yes... Had I known about 
Heracles beforehand I could 
have stopped them, but...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_512)You didn't know about 
that thing? You're in 
line to be emperor!

## POINTER 12
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS25_513)I know. But I have no authority 
over the Imperial Knights.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS25_514)The Imperial Knights act on orders 
from the emperor alone. They do 
not report to anyone else.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_515)Well, then, it's easy. 
Just become emperor.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS25_516)...You mean...

## POINTER 16
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS25_517)Becoming emperor isn't 
as simple as that.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS25_518)Why not?

## POINTER 18
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS25_519)To ascend to the throne, 
one must possess the imperial 
treasure, Dein Nomos.

## POINTER 19
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS25_520)But Dein Nomos went missing 
around the time of the 
Great War, ten years ago...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS25_521)Hmm, so that's the real 
story why we still don't 
have an emperor...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_522)...And that's why Ragou wanted to 
get his hands on Dein Nomos...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS25_523)What was that, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_524)Forget it. It's nothing.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS25_525)Anyway, is it really okay for 
an imperial candidate to be 
wandering the streets like this?

## POINTER 25
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS25_526)I was just on my 
way to Heliord.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS25_527)Ah, that is closer to Dahngrest 
than this place is. Negotiations 
would probably go smoother there.

## POINTER 27
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS25_528)I believe so, too.

## POINTER 28

<VOICE>(VS25_529)Master Ioder, we should be off.

## POINTER 29
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS25_530)If you'll please 
excuse me...

## POINTER 30
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS25_531)...
