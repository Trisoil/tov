<VOICE>(VS24_132)Ah, milord. Are you sure you 
shouldn't be going to the Sands 
of Kogorh, now, Sir?

## POINTER 2
Cumore
<VOICE>(VS24_133)Humph. I don't have to pay attention 
to Alexei's orders.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS24_134)Using the money and 
weapons I have, everything 
will soon be within my reach.

## POINTER 3

<VOICE>(VS24_135)And I hope you'll remember to 
appreciate the work Leviathan's 
Claw has done for you.

## POINTER 4
Cumore
<VOICE>(VS24_136)Yes, you will be taken 
care of, Yeager.

## POINTER 5
Yeager
<VOICE>(VS24_137)You'll take those weapons I sold you, 
and attack the Union--BOOM!

## POINTER 6
Cumore
<VOICE>(VS24_138)Heh. I'm afraid I have my sights set 
on loftier things than the Union.

## POINTER 7
Yeager
<VOICE>(VS24_139)Ignoring the Don is a big no-no. 
He is a wonderful guy, ja? 
Don't go forgetting that.

## POINTER 8
Cumore
<VOICE>(VS24_140)My my. It almost sounds as 
if you respect the man.

## POINTER 9
Yeager
<VOICE>(VS24_141)Respect him I do, but Leviathan's 
Claw always gets the job done.

## POINTER 10
Cumore
<VOICE>(VS24_142)Oh ho ho... Such 
dedication. That's just 
what I like about you.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS24_143)Don't worry though. You are 
looking at the future Commandant 
of the Imperial Knights.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS24_144)That fool Alexei, telling me to 
watch the Union while he 
signs friendship treaties with them.

## POINTER 11
Yeager
<VOICE>(VS24_145)Yeah! You tell 'im!

## POINTER 12
Cumore
<VOICE>(VS24_146)If it were me, I'd crush them 
in the blink of an eye with 
your lovely weapons!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS24_147)The Union can't possibly 
hope to stop me.

## POINTER 13
Yeager
<VOICE>(VS24_148)Heh heh heh. Ja, ja...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS24_149)Hey, that guy with the 
weird hair looked over 
here and laughed.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS24_150)He definitely spotted 
us all right.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS24_151)So he thinks we're 
funny, does he...?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS24_152)Man, it's always the same 
thing with these idiots.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS24_153)So now we know there's 
a bunch of people being 
kept down there.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS24_154)Yeah.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS24_155)All right. Let's go 
free them from 
the idiots.
