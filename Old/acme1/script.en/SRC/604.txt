Hey, is that you, <STR>(KAR)?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Dyne!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Who might this be?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
I'll do the introductions. This 
is Dyne from the Hunting Blades.<PAGE>He really took care of me 
while I was in that guild.<PAGE>These are the rest of my guildmates in Brave Vesperia.

## POINTER 4
Dyne
I'd heard you started up a guild 
of your own after our darling 
Nan gave you the boot.<PAGE>So? Things going well so far?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, we're getting by.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(KAR)...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Huh...? What's up?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
You sure this is okay...? You've 
got a bit of a rocky history with 
the Hunting Blades, don't you...?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
I what...? Oh, Dyne's 
not like that at all.

## POINTER 10
Dyne
This kid has a habit of trying to 
act way bigger than he is, and the 
others gave him hell about it.<PAGE>Not me though. I was a fair bit like him 
when I got started, so I could relate.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Huh.

## POINTER 12
Dyne
Glad to see you seem to be 
getting along just fine 
with your new group here.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, we're giving 
it our best shot.

## POINTER 14
Dyne
...Oh, say,<PAGE>I actually have a bit of 
a favor to ask you all.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
What is it?

## POINTER 16
Dyne
I'm headed to Desier soon to take care 
of a monster. This one sounds like 
a real nasty piece of work, though.<PAGE>The Chief and Tison are off on another 
job, so I can't ask them.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
So you want us to 
help you out?

## POINTER 18
Dyne
That's about the half of it, I guess.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
Well, should we take the job?

## POINTER 20
Accept job?
Accept
Do not accept

## POINTER 21
Dyne
Oh yeah, you'll do it?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Sure, a friend of <STR>(KAR)'s is a friend of ours. 
Just let us know what you need done.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
By the name of Brave Vesperia, the 
brightest star on the canvas of the 
night sky, we accept this task!

## POINTER 24
Dyne
Whoa, <STR>(KAR), listen to you 
sounding all grown up.<PAGE>All right then, you all'd better make 
sure and get yourselves good and 
ready. This guy's the real deal.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(KAR)
Right.

## POINTER 26
Dyne
My client's waiting for me at 
Mantaic, so I'll go on ahead.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(EST_P)
He did say Mantaic, 
right?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah. Anything odd about that?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(EST_P)
I just wondered what we'd do 
if the monster he's after 
turned out to be Phaeroh...

## POINTER 30
<STR>(KAR)
If that's what's going on, we'll 
just have to explain the situation 
to Phaeroh himself.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(KAR)
But Phaeroh's already 
become Efreet...

## POINTER 32
<STR>(YUR)
So basically, if Phaeroh does turn 
out to be the target for this job, 
we'd be better off not taking it.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(KAR)
We have already said we'd do 
it though, and it is Dyne...

## POINTER 34
<STR>(JUD)
Let's get ourselves to Mantaic. That should 
help us decide on a course of action.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(KAR)
Sounds good to me.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(EST_P)
Let's make sure we have everything 
we need before we set out.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(YUR)
That's probably 
not a bad idea.

## POINTER 38
Dyne
No, huh? Not exactly the answer I was hoping for...<PAGE>No point moping over it, though. I'll 
just have to look somewhere else.

## POINTER 39
Dyne
Oh, you'll take the job?
