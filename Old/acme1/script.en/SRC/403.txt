<VOICE>(VS37_149)<STR>(JUD_P)?!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS37_150)She's sleeping. She 
must be exhausted.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS37_151)Yeah, I mean, she 
just keeled over.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_152)Wasn't expecting that.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS37_153)I bet she watched over Ba'ul the 
entire time he was evolving. She 
probably didn't get much sleep.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_154)She probably had no idea 
when the Hunting Blades 
would attack, either.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS37_155)She was puttin' up a brave 
front, but she must've been 
near the end of her rope.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS37_156)She's just dumb. She 
doesn't know how to express 
what she's feeling.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS37_157)We can finish talking 
with her tomorrow. We 
should let her sleep now.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_158)In fact, I wouldn't mind a 
little shut-eye myself.
