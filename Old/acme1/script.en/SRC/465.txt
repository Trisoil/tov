Huh? Why?

## POINTER 2

Well, you see, an important official 
is visiting the mayor's house right 
now, and it's by his orders.<PAGE>The government's handling the money for the 
inn, so that anyone can stay here for free.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
That must be for all the refugees 
that've come to the town.

## POINTER 4

Circumstances being what they are, it takes the 
fun out of it, but our business is booming thanks 
to all of the visitors to our town.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Sounds like a good deal 
for the empire.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
So does that mean you don't 
have any vacancies?

## POINTER 7

You're in luck! I have one 
room that's not taken.

## POINTER 8

Then I'll take that 
room, thank you.

<STR>(RAV)
Hey there, no cuttin' 
in line!

## POINTER 10

Of course, I wouldn't think of not paying. 
I'll pay ten times the regular price.<PAGE>I'll also give the same amount to you travelers.

<STR>(YUR)
You son of a--

## POINTER 12

Oh, I'm so sorry!

## POINTER 13

## POINTER 14

What?!?! ...I knew this 
town was in the sticks, 
but this is--

## POINTER 15

Honey, let's just go on to 
Heliord from Nor Harbor.

## POINTER 16

Well said! I should be thankful we 
didn't soil our clothing in a filthy 
little hovel like this...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
They're gonna be in for a nasty surprise when 
they try to go to Port Nor...heh heh!

## POINTER 18

Sorry to have kept you waiting. 
Your room is upstairs, in front.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
Wha? But you said there weren't any vacancies...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
Business is business, right?

## POINTER 21

Yes, don't worry about it. I 
can't stand people like that.<PAGE>And wasn't it 
you who saved 
Halure's tree?<PAGE>This is the least I can 
do. Enjoy your stay!
