...To think that my son left 
home 13 years ago, with 
no word from him since...<PAGE>I wonder where he could be...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, would you happen to be the 
father of Rich, by any chance?

## POINTER 2

You...know Rich?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Yes, we met him while we were traveling.

## POINTER 4

Where is my son...?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
I think he's off somewhere, continuing 
his travels with Karen.

## POINTER 6

He's on a journey, then... I see...
That's why he wasn't in any of the cities.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Oh, but Rich wanted us to tell 
you... All of the Giganto 
Monsters have been beaten.

## POINTER 8

What the... The two of 
them managed that...?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
No, we were the ones who beat them, 
actually. We even have proof.

## POINTER 10

These are from the Giganto Monsters...
Amazing... 
This is simply amazing.<PAGE>If you happen to meet Rich again 
in the course of your travels...<PAGE>Would you mind telling him that I'll 
allow their marriage? Tell him 
that he should come back home!

Okay, I will!
