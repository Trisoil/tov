Do you really plan on helping 
<STR>(EST_P) find that Phaeroh...whatever?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I guess so.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Didn't that thing say that 
<STR>(EST_P) was an insipid poison 
or something?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I heard.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
After something like that I, guess 
you can't just tell her to forget 
about the whole thing.<PAGE>But it won't help her if she uses that 
as an excuse not to deal with the issue 
of the succession to the throne.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I'm worried that might happen.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Wh-what are you talking about? 
That's what IS happening!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, maybe.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
But...!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
You're saying I should take her back to the castle?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
It was her decision. We have 
to let her figure out what 
she should really do.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
You realize it might come 
to blows with this Phaeroh 
guy, right?<PAGE>She won't get to figure out 
anything at all if she dies!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
She's not going to die. That's 
why I'm going with her.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Argh, have it your way then!
