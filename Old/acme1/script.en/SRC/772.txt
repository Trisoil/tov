So you figured it out? There's 
lots of hermes blastia hidden 
inside the castle.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
Yes... Ba'ul was the one 
who noticed, actually.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
It was probably 
left behind by 
Alexei.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
So, you want to go
and destroy it, <STR>(JUD_P)?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
...Decreasing the imbalance of aer on the planet 
just a little bit will make it all the easier 
to go up against the Adephagos, won't it?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
...Yes, you're right.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
...I'll go too.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, why is that?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
If we don't break it and 
instead take the core...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Umm, do we really 
have to destroy it?<PAGE>Couldn't we just deactivate 
them somehow?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
That could work...in theory. But there's 
no guarantee that someone won't come along 
and try to get them working again.<PAGE>After all, it'll be just as inconvenient to have blastia 
that don't work as it will to have no blastia at all.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
Hold on! I told you, 
I'm going too!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, wait! <STR>(YUR), 
let's go too!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
*Sigh*
