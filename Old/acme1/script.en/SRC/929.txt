This is...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
It looks like it's 
an aer krene.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Wow, who would've thought 
a natural aer krene 
would be left here...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
With that giant rock sealin' it up, it makes 
sense that nobody'd get inta here until now.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
What's up, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
You shouldn't get 
too close...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
W-wait, let 
me see that!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Aha, just as I thought! It's just 
like the ones we saw before. The 
internal geometry is changing.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
What...what do you think will 
happen if you use it?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
Why don't you give it a try?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
How's this?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Whoa...
The orb's color is different
from last time...W-what is it?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
...The difference in color is
due to an increase in fire attributes..

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Fire...I wonder if it could 
burn anything you wanted.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
I think...that's probably 
not the case.<PAGE>It seems beyond the Sorcerer's 
Ring's capabilities.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
What was it? The two types 
of aer are reacting to each 
other, or something?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
On a basic level, that's 
pretty much right.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
I seeee. So the ring can burn 
a tree or a vine, since they've 
got aer runnin' through 'em.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
Not all material has aer flowing through 
it, so there are a lot of things the Sorcerer's 
Ring wouldn't be able to ignite.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
So depending on what's hit by the 
blast, some things will break, 
and other things will burn?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
I'd think most objects wouldn't 
even react at all.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
Yes, that's right.<PAGE>Normally, aer mixes with the 
surrounding atmosphere, and 
nothing happens at all.<PAGE>But if you take a mass of aer 
and collide it with a material 
that already contains aer...<PAGE>The violence of the sudden confluence 
of aer can destroy or ignite the 
original object that was struck.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
Mmm, that makes sense.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
That's all a bit too complicated 
for me to wrap my head around.<PAGE>But at least it's clear that we 
can put this ring to good use.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
So you mean...we could use this to burn 
up walls or trees that are blocking us from 
getting somewhere we need to go...!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, we can go places 
we couldn't before...<PAGE>Let's go around and see...!
