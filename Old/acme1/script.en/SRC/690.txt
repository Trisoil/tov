Master!

## POINTER 1

Princess...what are you doing 
in a place like this?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
...There's something I have 
to talk to <STR>(FRE) about, so...

## POINTER 3

I heard about you slipping out of the castle.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Um, um, ummm...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Who's this...?

## POINTER 6

I apologize for not having introduced myself 
sooner. My name is Drake Dropwart.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
He was the previous emperor's 
swordmaster, and is 
also my teacher.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Ah...the knightly 
patriot, Drake...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
The knightly patriot?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Master Drake has served 
the empire with his sweat 
and tears for decades.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
In the Imperial Knights, Drake 
Dropwart is thought of as a model 
for all knights to follow.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
He's now an advisor to the 
Imperial Knights, you know.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Wow, really?

## POINTER 14
Drake
I'm really an advisor in name only. 
These days I'm pretty much retired.<PAGE>My only real duty of late is teaching 
the Princess swordsmanship.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
But didn't you come 
here with the Commandant 
as an advisor?

## POINTER 16
Drake
Yes...I've heard everything 
that's happened so far.<PAGE>How was it, setting foot into the 
outside world for the first time?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
Well, we've had a lot of bad things 
happen to us, but all of it's 
been a fantastic experience.

## POINTER 18
Drake
A fantastic experience, 
you say? I see...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
...Ummm... Is something 
wrong...?

## POINTER 20
Leblanc
Mr. Drake, sir...!<PAGE>Wh-wh-wha...it's you...

## POINTER 21
Drake
What do you want, Leblanc?

## POINTER 22
Leblanc
Sir. His Excellency the Commandant 
is calling for you, sir.

## POINTER 23
Drake
All right.<PAGE>Well then, Princess, I must take 
my leave. Try to avoid doing 
anything too rash, won't you?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, of course. Take care 
of yourself, Master...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
I can't believe Drake Dropwart taught 
<STR>(EST_P) how to fight with a sword...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
I'm surprised that a princess would know 
how to use a sword at all, really.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(EST_P), what made you learn 
how to use a sword?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
That's a good question... It might 
take a while to tell the whole story. 
The next time I get a chance...

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I'd like to hear about it too, once 
things have calmed down a little.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(EST_P)
Sure!
