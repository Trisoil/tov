A fiery soul into a sea of flames...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
That's... That's what Mr. Seron said...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Would you be Yu's friend, Nobis?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Are you Yu's friend, Nobis?

## POINTER 4
Nobis
Indeed. You were 
sent to find me?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Yes, we brought you something 
from Yu Seron.

## POINTER 6
Nobis
You haven't looked at 
what's inside, have you?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? No, of course not...

## POINTER 8
Nobis
Very well. If that is all...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Oh, wait. I need to take 
some proof of delivery 
back to the client...

## POINTER 10
Nobis
Ah, okay. Let's see...you 
can take this to him 
as proof of delivery.

## POINTER 11
Nobis
Well then, say hello to Yu for me.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Of course. Thanks!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Pretty good for our first job.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
We're not done yet. We still gotta take 
this proof of delivery back to Yu.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
And then we'll finally be 
finished with the job.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
I'm glad we didn't lose the 
book before we got it to him!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
That would've been bad. I don't 
think you could just go out and 
buy a replacement for that book.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
How would you even lose 
something like that?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
Maybe if ya went ta the bathroom and accidentally 
left it by the sink when ya washed your hands?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Eww, that's dirty.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
What's dirty? You're 
washin' yer hands!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
We need to make sure not to lose 
the proof of delivery, too.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Okay, enough talking. 
Let's get moving!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, let's go to Mantaic 
and see the client.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RAV)
Yikes, are we going back all the way?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(KAR)
The sooner, the better.
Don't you want to tell the client?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
There's no need for a rush.
Talking of things like this, the more you wait, the more you joy.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(KAR)
Is that true... ?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
Let's see the client when we
stop by at Mantaic later sometime.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!
