Not this again...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Why does it always stop crying 
when you hold it, <STR>(RIT)?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
I dunno.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Why are you crying all 
of the sudden...?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Uh, ummm... 
Maybe it's 
hungry...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Maybe we should 
give it a banana?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Ack, that hurts...! 
Wh-who did that...?!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RIT), this baby is still 
too young to eat bananas.<PAGE>Maybe if we gave it some 
milk or something else...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Who would've thought he would just 
pee like that all of the sudden...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
I, umm...I'm going to go 
see if I can find something 
to use as diaper...!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Somebody's all smiles now that he drank 
his wittle wittle milk! Isn't that right?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
There's a good boy, there's a good boy.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
...I was really surprised 
to see that he was a boy.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
You're blushing, <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
Huh...?!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Heh, just kidding.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
Hee hee, he's sleeping so soundly!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
*Yawn* It's way 
past my bedtime, 
too...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
And yet you've been 
awake for hours taking 
care of him...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
Well, I can't just leave him alone.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
...You know, I wonder 
where <STR>(YUR) and the 
rest ran off to.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
Don't you think the two of 
us look like a mom and dad? 
A happy little couple!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
Huh? What are you talking about?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
If we...if we don't end up finding 
his mother, we should adopt 
him and raise him together...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
You're crazy, <STR>(EST_P)...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
Kid...
...Don't you 
go forgetting us once 
the morning comes.
