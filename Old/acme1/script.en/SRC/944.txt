## POINTER 0

Ever since we lost Barbos, we've 
been absolutely pathetic!

## POINTER 1

What's more, the Blood Alliance got 
tossed out of the five master guilds!

## POINTER 2

If the boss hadn't sold this city to Alexei, 
we would've had a strong guild presence 
with a respectable base stronghold here!

## POINTER 3

Thanks to Alexei's damned blastia 
experiments we're stuck 
in these wretched ruins.

## POINTER 4

At least we got one good 
piece of booty. That damned 
dragon rider's spear!<PAGE>I hear that spear's pretty 
famous. The old man at 
the smithy said so.

## POINTER 5

Who dares set foot inside 
our hideout...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Wait, aren't you Barbos'...
That spear...!

## POINTER 7

Wait, these kids...
They're the little punks 
that beat the boss at Ghasfarost...

## POINTER 8

Wh-what?! We haven't 
done anything wrong!

## POINTER 9

Everything we did...it was 
on our boss's orders...!

## POINTER 10

Crap... Let's get outta here...!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
Hold it! Leave 
that spear.

## POINTER 12

Wh-why...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
That belongs to one of our members. 
We can't let you have it.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
You two...

## POINTER 15

Hell no, that 
spear is our...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
What's that? You're ready 
to fight to defend it?

## POINTER 17

D-damn it...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
...There you go.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
Really, you're giving this to me? This is the spear 
that destroyed all of that blastia, you know.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
It's important to you, right? 
Weren't you looking for it?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
This is the spear of my oath...<PAGE>The oath that no matter how hard it got, even 
if no one understood or wanted to help, 
I would continue in my quest with Ba'ul.<PAGE>I swore on this spear, a symbol 
of the bond between Ba'ul and me.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Wow, so it's really important to you...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
And you were just going to give 
up on getting it back?!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
Thanks to you all, I've learned that you 
can have a bond with someone without 
any physical objects to back it up.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
But <STR>(JUD)! You should never 
have to forget feelings that 
are important to you!<PAGE>You can't just give up on them!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(JUD)
I'm sorry.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(JUD_P), I don't think you need 
to be apologizing here.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(JUD)
...You're right. 
Thank you, <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RIT)
D-don't mention it! I was just running my mouth. That's all.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(JUD)
...Really, thank you.
