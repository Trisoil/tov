The water dried up...?

What did you do?

Gnome's power has brought about extraordinary 
growth in the roots of the trees.<PAGE>These roots have bored holes through 
the surrounding crags.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
I get it... The water escaped through 
those holes, since it was originally 
higher than sea level.

<STR>(YUR)
He certainly does some 
pretty extreme things for 
how docile he looks.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Welcome back.

The fertile forest has returned. You may 
feel free to visit it at your leisure.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah... We'll go 
down there when 
we get a chance.

## POINTER 8
Sylph
Then, we shall now take our leave...

Gnome is so cute...

elemental spirit "cute?"
