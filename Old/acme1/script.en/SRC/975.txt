What's this?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
It's a conduction tube for aer.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
This carries aer up higher in the tower, then?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Why would they want to carry 
aer higher in the tower?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Come to think of it, there was a giant 
blastia on the roof of the tower.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
But there's no aer passing 
through here.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Maybe it's broken.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
...Looks that way.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
What's this?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
It's a conduction tube for aer.
...There's no aer passing through it, though...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Oh, right! The gear we saw 
powers the aer supply!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
All right, then we can leave 
this for now, right?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Sure.
