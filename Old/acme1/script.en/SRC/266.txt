Ohhh, it's soooo 
hot out here...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
Hello there.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Oh? Oops! Did you get an eyeful just now?

## POINTER 3

N-no, I d-didn't see anything! I didn't 
even see if there was anything to see!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, is that so...that's a shame.

## POINTER 5

A sh-shame...?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
Are you going to make me say it out loud?

## POINTER 7

Err... 
...?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
I've fallen madly in love with 
your big, strong...work ethic.

## POINTER 9

M-madly in love...?!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
Mmmhmmm... So...you get 
what I'm saying, right?

## POINTER 11

Err.... Maybe...?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
Maybe I'll just have to come out and make 
it clear. Would you like for you and me 
to...have a little fun? *wink*

## POINTER 13

Yeah! B-but...there's someone 
back in the capital I promised 
to marry...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, don't be such 
a stick in the mud.

## POINTER 15

But, I...hmm...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Good work.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
Can't believe adults can be 
easily fooled like this.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
And, how long are you going 
to stay in that costume?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
I guess this calls too much attention.
I'll leave it at the shop.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
But what was the "fun" thing 
you were talking about?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
Going for a swim.
