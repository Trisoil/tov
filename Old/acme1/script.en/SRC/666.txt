Ahhh! You there, in 
black! Yes, you!<PAGE>I've been looking for you!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Is this a friend of yours?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
I don't exactly have very many 
nobles for friends...present 
company excepted, of course.

## POINTER 3

You've got a bounty 
on you, right?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Looks like you got 
another fan, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Let's get outta here!

## POINTER 6

No, please wait! I'm not going 
to turn you in! Please, listen 
to what I have to say.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
The Imperial Knights will show up 
if he keeps yelling like that!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
I know. Look, I'll hear you out. 
Just keep your voice down.

## POINTER 9

Yes, of course, I'm sorry. 
My name is Shel. And 
you would be...<STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
In the flesh.

## POINTER 11
Shel
Actually I've come to you precisely 
because of your bounty. Please. 
Could you find my brother?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
What does <STR>(YUR)'s bounty have 
to do with your brother?

## POINTER 13
Shel
Well, my brother just can't let 
criminals go. So I thought that 
with a bounty on your head...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
So to get this straight...you want 
to use <STR>(YUR) as bait to lure your 
brother out into the open?

## POINTER 15
Shel
That's a bit of a harsh way of saying 
it, but essentially...yes.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Sorry, find yourself another sucker.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR), wait!<PAGE>...You haven't been able 
to find your brother?

## POINTER 18
Shel
No, I haven't heard from him ever since 
he left the capital three years ago.<PAGE>He left on a journey to do great 
deeds and become famous.<PAGE>He used to be in the Knights, 
but he couldn't get famous, 
even after many brave deeds.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, unless your superior officers 
happen to be really nice, they'll take 
all the credit for anything you do.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
Why was your brother so concerned 
about making a name for himself?

## POINTER 21
Shel
His girlfriend's father said that 
he wouldn't allow their marriage 
unless he became famous.<PAGE>He told him, "The man who marries 
my daughter must be known throughout 
the world for his righteous deeds!"

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
So then, what is 
your brother's 
girlfriend doing now...?

## POINTER 23
Shel
She's still waiting for him to return. Her 
father has since passed away, so there's 
no one left to oppose their marriage.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
So if your brother comes back, 
they can get married!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
*Sigh* Here we go again... There's no 
guarantee that he won't try to kill me.

## POINTER 27
Shel
I would even be happy with just 
some information about my brother's 
whereabouts. His name is Clay.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
Clay. Got it. 
We'll look for him.
