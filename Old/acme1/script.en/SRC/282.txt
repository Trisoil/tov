<STR>(JUD)
Oh? Are you going to 
look for that Cumore 
guy, by any chance?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, just going 
on a walk. Where 
were you?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Just out for a walk, like you.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
What you said to <STR>(EST_P) 
earlier hasn't been gnawing 
at you, has it?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
What I said earlier?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Didn't you say some pretty 
harsh things to <STR>(EST_P)...?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, right. Sorry to beat you 
to the punch like that...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
What? You didn't beat me to 
the punch on anything...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
You were going to tell 
her the same thing that 
I did, weren't you?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
What, you figured it out?<PAGE>You don't have to apologize 
for something like that.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
All right...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
So you weren't going off to look for 
Cumore after feeling bad about hurting 
<STR>(EST_P) with what you said?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
No, I wasn't.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Hmph...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
You don't believe me?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
You care for other people's feelings 
a lot more than you let on, I think.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
No, not at all!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Well, whatever.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
What about you? Aren't you 
going out to look for him?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
I told you already. I'm 
just going for a walk.
