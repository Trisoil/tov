<VOICE>(VS65_020)Whoa...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_021)Man... How could all 
of this be kept underground 
for so long?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS65_022)The ancient Geraios civilization. 
This is more amazing than 
anything in a book.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS65_023)Something feels strange.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_024)I know this is a weapon, because he's 
going to use it against the Adephagos.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_025)But from outside, it looked like a city. Did 
they turn an entire city into a weapon?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS65_026)This place is enormous. 
So many people must 
have lived here.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_027)And now one man is holed 
up in here to destroy 
every last person.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS65_028)Duke... I'd rather not meet 
him if we don't have to.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_029)That soldier was already 
a hero in the Great War.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_030)Who knows how much stronger 
he's gotten since.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_031)What are you talking about?
We'll just kill the Adephagos 
before we fight Duke.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS65_032)Then Duke won't have a reason 
to sacrifice humanity.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS65_033)I hope so...
