<STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
This is the same place we met last time.

## POINTER 3
Nan
Yes.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Have you been okay? What have 
you been doing since I saw you?

## POINTER 5
Nan
Nothing much...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
I, I see.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Oh, about your 
Monster Book...<PAGE>I finally finished filling it with monsters!

## POINTER 8
Nan
Huh...?!

## POINTER 9
Nan
You managed to do a full ecological survey 
of the world's monsters, something the 
Hunting Blades couldn't even do...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Heh heh...
I guess I've just gotten 
a little more skilled since 
I left the Hunting Blades?

## POINTER 11
Nan
......<PAGE>Didn't I tell you...not to report 
all of this stuff to me?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Y-yeah. But since you were 
the one who gave me the book...I 
wanted you to know.

## POINTER 13
Nan
I see. Don't you and your friends have 
an important mission to be doing?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
...Yes, you're right. 
I'm sorry.

## POINTER 15
Nan
Y-you don't have to apologize!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Huh?

## POINTER 17
Nan
Why did you hold onto 
that book for so long?<PAGE>It was blank! 
It was useless!<PAGE>I thought you'd never 
be able to finish it!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Wh-what are you talking about, Nan?

## POINTER 19
Nan
...And then, before I knew 
it...
You overtook me...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
Nan, cheer up!

## POINTER 21
Nan
Why would you want to...care 
about me...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
Nan...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Let's go to the inn to wait for him.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, that's thoughtful of you, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
They're still just a couple of kids!

## POINTER 26

How 
bittersweet!
