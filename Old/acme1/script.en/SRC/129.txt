Man, there are a lot of Mordio 
look-alikes here, aren't there?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Excuse me, do you have a minute?

## POINTER 2

Wh-what do you want?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Would you happen to know if a knight named 
<STR>(FRE) Scifo has come through here?

## POINTER 4

<STR>(FRE)? Ohh, that guy, he was saying 
something about going to catch someone 
who'd been vandalizing ruins...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
Where is he now?!

## POINTER 6

I couldn't say. My research keeps me too busy 
to pay attention to things like that.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
I-I see. ...I'm sorry 
to interrupt you.

## POINTER 8

I'll be taking my leave, then.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, wait up. Tell 
me one more thing.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Is there a famed mage named 
Mordio around here?

## POINTER 11

Ack! There are people who want to see that weirdo?!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
So I was right. You know Mordio?

## POINTER 13

...No, uh, I don't know anything at all. I 
don't associate with people like that...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, I'm not done yet!

## POINTER 15

What! What is it!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Tell me where the mage is!

## POINTER 17

Mordio lives alone in a shack 
back that way. Go and see for 
yourself if you want!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Thanks.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
Are you sure about this?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
Hmm?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
Everyone seems to get all out of sorts just 
from hearing that guy's name. It's weird.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
Yeah, doesn't it bother you?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Well, he's a blastia thief. It's 
no wonder people don't like him.
