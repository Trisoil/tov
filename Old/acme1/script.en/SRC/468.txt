## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_035)It sounds like the entire 
capital's been covered in aer.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_036)And the one in the middle 
of it all is most likely...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS48_037)That's insane! If he's using <STR>(EST_P) 
to cause all of that, then...
She can't handle that!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_038)Who knows how much of a toll it takes on her 
each time she's forced to use her power?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_039)She was already having problems
controlling it. Now there's no 
telling what will happen to her.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS48_040)What if...what if we get 
there too late, and...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS48_041)Even if we take out 
Alexei, she...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS48_042)Do...do ya think maybe 
there's a way ta get her 
power under control?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS48_043)There is. There has to be. We 
just haven't found it yet...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS48_044)Ah...hm. Hey, what 
about the Knights?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_045)<STR>(FRE)'s doing what he can, 
but it's not enough. They 
don't have Dein Nomos.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS48_046)Hmm...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS48_047)I'll try asking Phaeroh. It

much time we have left.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_048)...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS48_049)<STR>(YUR)...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_050)Hey, did we wake you up? 
How are you feeling?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS48_051)Looks like I slowed you 
guys down again. ...You're 
going to the capital, right?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_052)Donâ€™t worry about that now. 
We're still figuring out what 
to do. You just get better.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS48_053)Yeah, I just don't want 
to be left behind, okay?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_054)Our whole guild is gonna 
rescue <STR>(EST_P)...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_055)I know. Why don't you try and 
get some more sleep, huh?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS48_056)Okay...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS48_057)I can't seem to reach him.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_058)The aer may be 
causing interference.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_059)No big deal. Either way, it's 
just a matter of making Alexei 
sorry he ever started this.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_060)Right?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS48_061)...And nothing more?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_062)...I'm gonna go get 
some fresh air.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_063)Keep an eye on 
<STR>(KAR) for me.
