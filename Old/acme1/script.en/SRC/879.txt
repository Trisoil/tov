...You defeated all of 
the Giganto Monsters...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah... We ended up beating them all ourselves.

## POINTER 2
Rich
Thank you...

## POINTER 3
Karen
Thanks to you wonderful people, we can 
finally go back to our hometown!

## POINTER 4
Rich
...That's true, but...<PAGE>...Let's keep traveling 
for a while...

## POINTER 5
Karen
Huh...? 
Why?!<PAGE>We can finally go home! 
You can see your father!<PAGE>I'm sure he'll 
acknowledge our 
marriage, now!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? Did you just say "marriage?"

## POINTER 7
Rich
...Yes...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
But wait...aren't you two 
brother and sister...?

## POINTER 9
Karen
My father and Rich's father were 
both members of the Regin Expeditionary 
Force together.<PAGE>Because of that, the two of us have 
been friends since we were kids, and 
we've been as close as siblings.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
But you're not actually siblings...

## POINTER 11
Karen
Rich's father is the only 
surviving member of the 
expeditionary force.<PAGE>For that reason, he said he would never 
acknowledge our marriage until we defeated 
all of the Giganto Monsters.

## POINTER 12
Rich
...And I was planning on doing that, too...<PAGE>...To fulfill His Highness's 
lifelong wish...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
But defeating a Giganto 
Monster by yourself? 
That's insane!

## POINTER 14
Rich
...Yes... It's insane. Suicide, 
probably. But that wasn't 
enough to make me stop...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
So you just got into the habit 
of wandering around...<PAGE>You should've told us all 
this sooner. You should've 
asked us for help.<PAGE>We could've gotten it taken care of faster.

## POINTER 16
Rich
...I'm sorry.

## POINTER 17
Karen
...Come on, let's go back. Let's 
go back to your father...

## POINTER 18
Rich
...Why not just keep things the way they 
are...? We won't need to be tied down 
by all the formalities of marriage...<PAGE>...We can just wander around 
forever... That wouldn't 
be so bad, would it?<PAGE>...Forever, together.

## POINTER 19
Karen
Big brother...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
...What the...<PAGE>You mean, we beat all 
of those Giganto Monsters 
for nothing?

## POINTER 21
Rich
...No, that's not true...<PAGE>...You've brought honor back 
to my father...and to His 
Highness Regin as well...

## POINTER 22
Karen
His Highness' biggest hope was that people 
could live in peace, without having to 
worry about being attacked by monsters.<PAGE>That's was why 
he traveled around 
the world. ∀

## POINTER 23
Rich
...If you ever meet my father 
in your travels...<PAGE>...Please tell him that 
all of the Giganto Monsters 
have been defeated...<PAGE>...My father should still 
live in Capua Torim...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
Sure, I can try to remember.

## POINTER 25
Rich
...Really...
...Thank you...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
If you're going to thank anyone, you should thank 
our monster-hunting all-star, right here.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
You mean m-me...?

## POINTER 28
Rich
...Such a large weapon for 
such a small person...<PAGE>...Fantastic...
And still just a boy...<PAGE>...Truly fantastic...
...You've got potential...

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
H-heh, thank you!

## POINTER 30
Rich
...It's just like a valiant,
unfinished sword...

## POINTER 31
Karen
That reminds me, I've got something for
you. Please come with me to the carriage.

## POINTER 32
Karen
We got this from Scicily, a guest
who stayed with us last time.<PAGE>He said this is for when
I have kids...But I'm not
even married yet. ∀

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
Do you really want
us to have this?

## POINTER 34
Karen
Yes, this'll probably be too
big for kids, even when I
do have them one day.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(RAV)
We must be some special
guest to receive this...

## POINTER 36
<STR>(JUD)
It's cute!

## POINTER 37
<STR>(JUD)
It suits you.

## POINTER 38
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah...very kiddy?

## POINTER 39
Karen
If you happen to see our carriage again, 
please stop by and say hi! We'll always 
have room for you to stay the night! ♪

## POINTER 40
<STR>(EST_P)
Thank you!

## POINTER 41
Karen
No, thank you!
