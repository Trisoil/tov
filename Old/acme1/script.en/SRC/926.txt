All this laziness can't be good 
for you, Schwann. Aren't your 
skills getting a bit rusty?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
How rude! My name isn't even Schwann, 
and my skills aren't gettin' rusty, 
tarnished, or anything else!

## POINTER 2
Drake
Then perhaps you'd be willing to go a round?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Oh, ya wanna rumble?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
I surrender!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
You don't have to surrender...

## POINTER 6
Drake
To think that Schwann Oltorain 
could be bested by an 
old codger like myself!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
I told ya, I'm 
not Schwann!

## POINTER 8
Drake
...Well then, have it your way.

## POINTER 9
Drake
Alexei was a very capable man, 
but he was too single-minded, 
and lacked personal magnetism.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
I'll bet that wouldn't even be news 
ta the former Commandant himself.

## POINTER 11
Drake
In contrast, Schwann had a very 
human personality. He was made of 
the right stuff to lead others.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
Oh yeah? Hah hah hah...<PAGE>Hah...!

## POINTER 13
Drake
Because he was such a born leader...there was 
something that I wished to pass on to him.<PAGE>But if he's died, then I have 
no one to give it to...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
What's the thing you wanted to pass on to him?

## POINTER 15
Drake
The Imperial Knights' strongest arcane arte...<PAGE>The technique that was used to wipe out so 
many monsters at once in the Great War.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Wow, really?

## POINTER 17
Drake
Besides Schwann, there's no one else in the Imperial 
Knights worthy of carrying on this legacy.<PAGE>I may end up taking it with me to my grave.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
...It doesn't bother you that 
such an amazing technique would 
disappear from this world?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
Regardless...
I'm not Schwann, 
after all, soâ€¦<PAGE>...Argh!
I must reveal the truth! 
I am Schwann's...brother!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
Sheesh...
Do you really expect 
him to believe that tripe--

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
So I'm askin' ya, Old Man! Would 
you pass that technique on ta me, 
in place of my dear brother?

## POINTER 22
Drake
Hmpf... All right. 
<STR>(RAV), was it?<PAGE>I shall bestow you with the Imperial Knights' strongest 
arcane arte, in place of your brother.

## POINTER 23
Drake
Make us proud.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAV)
Yes, sir!

## POINTER 25
Drake
I hope I don't have anything to worry about.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
...I don't know what yer talkin' about!

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
Yeesh, wouldn't it be a whole lot easier 
to just drop this <STR>(RAV) thing?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RAV)
Whaddaya mean? After all, 
I'm <STR>(RAV)! Who's this 
Schwann guy, anyway?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
Well, it's not like I care either way...
