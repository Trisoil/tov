Hi, um, we're looking 
for Mr. Markham...

## POINTER 1

I am Markham. You are?

## POINTER 2

Mark, it's you know who. That 
request you posted...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
Have we met?

## POINTER 4

I'm Mark's friend, 
Joshua.

## POINTER 5
Markham
You're here because of my little 
want ad with the Union?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Yep, that's us. We'd like to 
hear a little more about it.

## POINTER 7
Markham
It was the last time I went to the excavation 
site. Believe it or not I forgot my shovel there. 
I'd like for you to go and get it for me.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Did you say, shovel?

## POINTER 9
Joshua
That's right, shovel. They're also 
called trowels or spades sometimes.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
That's it?

## POINTER 11
Markham
What do you mean, "that's 
it?" This is no trifling matter! 
Have some respect!

## POINTER 12
Joshua
Now, Mark...calm down.

## POINTER 13
Markham
Calm down?! He dismissed our 
precious tool of the trade 
as if it were nothing!

## POINTER 14
Joshua
I heard it too, but you've gotta take some deep breaths now.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
If it's so precious to you, why'd you 
go and forget it in the first place?

## POINTER 16
Markham
Urk... Well, you see..

## POINTER 17
Joshua
He was set upon by monsters and 
forced to leave it behind. 
He wept the whole way back.

## POINTER 18
Markham
Of course we'd love to go get 
it ourselves, but without 
some help, there's no way.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
Why not cut your losses 
and buy a new one?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
If you can afford to pay 
us, that sounds like 
an easier fix to me.

## POINTER 21
Markham
Do you know what you're saying? If a tool 
doesn't fit the hand just so, it's impossible 
to get any real work done!

## POINTER 22
Joshua
It's just a shovel.
But it's far more than a shovel.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
This makes no sense...

## POINTER 24
Markham
Without my shovel, 
I've got no 
job. Please!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(KAR)
Okay, then. We'll do it.<PAGE>You can't always pick and choose 
the work that comes your way.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
You don't say... Hey, why 
not? You're starting to 
sound like a boss again.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
Heh heh... Think so?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RIT)
Don't go heaping too much praise on 
him. It goes straight to his head.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
By the name of Brave Vesperia, the 
brightest star on the canvas of the 
night sky, we accept this task!

## POINTER 30
Markham
The place is the temple of Baction 
on the Hypionian continent. 
I'm depending on you.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
Of course it would have to be there...

## POINTER 32
<STR>(KAR)
What part of the temple?

## POINTER 33
Markham
As I recall, I headed to the northern 
side as soon as I got underground.<PAGE>I went one floor deeper, and 
I remember checking out 
the area around there...

## POINTER 34
<STR>(JUD)
That information's a little vague.

## POINTER 35
Markham
Also, you can tell 
it's mine by the name 
on the handle.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(KAR)
We'll just have to go 
with those clues then.
