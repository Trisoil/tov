Do you have a minute?

## POINTER 1

Huh? What the hell 
do you want?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
You seem to be doing very well... 
You're a pro, right?<PAGE>You don't see real professional 
gamblers around here very often.

## POINTER 3

Gambling is my life. When I'm playing, time 
and space cease to have any meaning. All 
that remains is betting, then winning.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, really? Then do all of these easy 
opponents do it for you? Or are you looking 
for more of a challenge, perhaps?

## POINTER 5

What do you mean...

## POINTER 6

Wait, you couldn't be...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Ha ha. <STR>(JUD_P)'s determined, 
all right.<PAGE>It looks like she's starting to 
put her strategy into gear.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
When did <STR>(JUD) 
change into that 
outfit, anyway?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, come to think of it, 
that's a good question.<PAGE>That outfit's pretty over the top...

## POINTER 10

You may have already 
noticed, but I'm not 
cheating or anything.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
It seems that way. But this place was set 
up so that everyone can have a good time.<PAGE>You know what happens when a 
pro like you gets serious against 
a bunch of amateurs?

## POINTER 12

Hmph! I play 'em like I see 
'em. That's all it is.<PAGE>If you're so intent on 
getting rid of me...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
I thought it might come to this. All 
right. I'll accept your challenge.

## POINTER 14

Heh...interesting.<PAGE>If I lose, I'll give up everything 
I've won and never come in 
here again. What about you?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
Yes, hmmm... Then 
I'll bet...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
I can't hear too well. 
What did she just say?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
I couldn't hear, either. 
I wonder what she bet.

## POINTER 18

All right, it's a bet. What's 
your game of choice?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
Ah, yes... How about this?

## POINTER 20

Cards, eh? Sounds good to me.

## POINTER 21

Each of us will play a five-game match against 
the dealer. You start with 100 chips. 
See how many you can get by the end...<PAGE>Also, we can both watch to make 
sure that neither of us cheats.<PAGE>Are you good on the rules now?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
Yes.

## POINTER 23

Okay! Then allow 
me to begin!

## POINTER 24

Hmph, looks like I ended 
up with 1200 chips.<PAGE>All right, now it's your turn.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(JUD)
All right, I'm done.

## POINTER 26

Hmm... I lost. I'm 
impressed. So the 
legends are true...

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
......

## POINTER 28

I admit defeat. As promised, I'll 
return my winnings, and I'll 
stop coming here for good.

## POINTER 29

Hmph. Looks 
like I won, 
doesn't it?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(JUD)
Yes. I lost.

## POINTER 31

But you know, I'm tired of this 
place. I don't need the money 
here anymore, either.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(JUD)
What's gotten into you?

## POINTER 33

Dunno. I guess a new casino 
is just calling my name, 
and I've gotta answer.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(JUD)
You're a good sport.

## POINTER 35

Eh? I was able to play against you. 
That's the most important thing.

## POINTER 36

Until we meet again.

## POINTER 37
Kaufman
Amazing! Thank you for your 
help! Thank you so much!<PAGE>H-how did you do it? Who the 
hell are you, anyway?!

## POINTER 38
<STR>(JUD)
I'm just an average, run-of-the mill Krityan.

## POINTER 39
Kaufman
You may've lost the 
game, but you did 
great! Thank you!

## POINTER 40
Kaufman
Now, for your reward...

## POINTER 41
<STR>(YUR)
I was surprised at how quickly he left. I thought 
he'd put up more of a fight, or something.<PAGE>Are all gamblers like that?

## POINTER 42
<STR>(JUD)
Who knows? Not me.<PAGE>But he played honorably. 
It was a fun match.

## POINTER 43
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, <STR>(JUD)! You bet something while 
you were playing against him, right?<PAGE>I couldn't hear what it 
was. What did you bet?

## POINTER 44
<STR>(JUD)
I told him if he won, he'd 
never have to pay for food 
or drinks here again.

## POINTER 45
<STR>(KAR)
...Huh?

## POINTER 46
<STR>(JUD)
He earns his living by 
gambling, after all.<PAGE>A bet of anything else would've 
been an insult.<PAGE>His very way of life was on the line!

## POINTER 47

Madam President! Madam President! A strange 
man is going around to all of the food 
stands and taking food without paying!<PAGE>And he keeps saying 
"put it on my tab." 
What do we do?

## POINTER 48
<STR>(JUD)
Uh oh.

## POINTER 49
