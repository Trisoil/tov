Excuse me, I am looking 
for some fascinating outfits.

## POINTER 1

Fascinating...!?
Are you out for a date?
How about this?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Ugh, how plain.

## POINTER 3

Hmm...well, how 
about this one?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Nope...

## POINTER 5

All right, then what about this!

## POINTER 6

What exactly 
are you looking for?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
For example...

## POINTER 8

N-no way,
I have nothing like that.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
Then could you possibly 
make one for me?

## POINTER 10

Let's see...<PAGE>If you brought me a soft tail, basilisk 
scale and small bird feather, I could 
make you something very special.

## POINTER 11

You should be able to get all 
of the items from monsters on 
the outskirts of the city.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
All right, let's go.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(JUD)'s really into 
this, isn't she?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Seems like she likes this sort of thing...
