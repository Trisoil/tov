Is that it down there!?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
That's some cloud of dust.
Are those all monsters!?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
This seems to be a counter 
effect of Astal's losing control. <PAGE>It's as if the monsters of the
world all came and gathered here.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Is <STR>(FRE) really down
there somewhere?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Probably.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
What next? Are we gonna 
fight every single one of 'em?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(RIT), can't we use that 
Dein Nomos you made?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Ya gonna blow them away like
doing it to the Adephagos?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Right...<PAGE>Applying directivity to the power of
spirits and forming a barrier-like force
field to eliminate the monsters.....<PAGE>Yes, it should be possible.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
But this was made to be used
against the Adephagos, right?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
But this is our only 
option now.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Could you let us use it?
Please?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
I beg you too.<PAGE>The Dein Nomos...
I want to believe it
can save mankind...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Yes, if we can't deal with this 
easily, there is no way we could
stand up against the Adephagos.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
Alright. Let's do it.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
It's rare to hear <STR>(YUR)
ask for a favor like that.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
It's our chance to do <STR>(YUR) a favor!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Cut it out guys.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
So what's our plan?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
Activate it in the area where the monsters
are all concentrated. That's it. Simple, right?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah it is.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
No kidding...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
Why don't we give it
a name?<PAGE>We can't just call it the <STR>(RIT) Dein Nomos...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
Huh? ...I'll leave it up to you.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
Uh, mmm, ahh...I got it!
How about the "Vesperia No. 1"?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
I should have known better...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
It's got a nice ring to it. 
Besides, it's nice n' simple.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
Even Ba'ul will need to keep some distance.
I'll land at a place.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
OK, let's do it.
