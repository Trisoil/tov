Ladies and gentlemen!
This is the event you've
all been waiting for!<PAGE>The first annual Fortune's 
Banquet exhibition match 
is about to begin!<PAGE>This event is brought to you by His Royal 
Highness Ioder, the Guild Union, and our 
generous co-sponsor, Fortune's Market!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Wow, this is a pretty impressive event!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Doesn't that little prince have anything 
more important to be doing?

## POINTER 3

First, I'll explain the rules. The competition 
will be divided into three dishes: an 
appetizer, a main course, and a dessert.<PAGE>Competitors must impress the judges 
with the flavor, arrangement and overall 
composition of their chosen dishes!<PAGE>And now, to present the challengers. 
From the Guilds, the gourmet-recommended 
cuisinier, Chef <STR>(RAV)!

## POINTER 4

And representing the empire, 
hailing from the Imperial 
Knights, Chef <STR>(FRE) Scifo!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Not that I'm one to talk, but 
what the heck is he doing here?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
I'll bet he got suckered in by all that 
stuff 'bout promotin' goodwill 
between the Empire and the Guilds.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(FRE)
I always wanted to go up against 
you in battle at least once.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
Is this the sorta battle 
you were imaginin'?

## POINTER 9

And now, without further ado, let 
the first annual Fortune's Banquet 
exhibition match begin!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Is <STR>(FRE) skilled at cooking, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
He's good. His cooking looks very nice, so 
these rules might give him an advantage.<PAGE>His only problem is that he bases his 
cooking style on his own tastes...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
W-what is he doing...?

## POINTER 13

Stop your cooking! We will now 
move on to the tasting and 
judging of the prepared dishes!<PAGE>Three judges from our sponsors and two 
judges chosen from the two competitors' 
teams will evaluate the dishes.<PAGE>And now, the tasting and judging will commence!
First, the dishes of our Guild challenger, Chef <STR>(RAV).

## POINTER 14
Leblanc
Mmm... This is...truly delicious. 
It blows the food in the knights' 
dining hall out of the water.

## POINTER 15
Kaufman
It's not bad. I might 
even pay for it.

## POINTER 16
Ioder
A delicate taste with a hint 
of adventure. This might even 
be better than the castle 
chef's cooking. Fantastic.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
Wow, <STR>(RAV), your cooking 
is surprisingly good.

## POINTER 18
Wonder Chef
I know how to choose a good chef!

## POINTER 19

It seems that Chef <STR>(RAV)'s dishes left 
a favorable impression on our panel!

## POINTER 20
Leblanc
Hmph, it's good enough 
to eat, I suppose.

## POINTER 21
Kaufman
The taste is all right. I'd eat 
it if someone else were paying.

## POINTER 22
Ioder
Ahh, so this is what the 
common people eat...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
This is about as bad as it always is, I guess.

## POINTER 24
Wonder Chef
Could it...could it be that I erred 
in my chef selection? No, it 
cannot be. It simply cannot!

## POINTER 25

Could this mean the end for Chef <STR>(RAV)?!

## POINTER 26

Next, the dishes of our challenger 
from the empire, Chef <STR>(FRE)!

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
Wow, this looks so nice...

## POINTER 28
Ioder
This is art...with the 
plate as the canvas.

## POINTER 29
Kaufman
It's not every day that I see 
food so beautiful that I 
hesitate to bite into it.

## POINTER 30
Wonder Chef
That man has mastered the essence 
of cooking. He is a culinary 
force to be reckoned with!

## POINTER 31
Leblanc
Mmm....uck?!

## POINTER 32
Kaufman
Ick...

## POINTER 33
<STR>(KAR)
Wargh?!

## POINTER 34

W-what is this? Our judge's panel is 
in a state of total chaos! One by 
one, they are dropping like flies!

## POINTER 35
<STR>(FRE)
Master Ioder, what do you think?

## POINTER 36
Ioder
...It appears I've made 
the wrong choice.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(FRE)
It wasn't to your liking? 
I'm sorry...<PAGE>I thought that I did a good job, too...

## POINTER 38
Wonder Chef
This is sacrilege against the 
culinary art! You ought to 
be ashamed of yourself!!

## POINTER 39
<STR>(JUD)
The panel's going to hell 
in a handbasket...

## POINTER 40
<STR>(RIT)
Did <STR>(FRE) poison that 
food or something?

## POINTER 41
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(FRE) should know better than 
to trust his own judgment in 
a competition like this...

## POINTER 42
<STR>(JUD)
Something's the matter with 
his sense of taste, isn't it?

## POINTER 43
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah. <STR>(FRE)'s got practically 
no sense of taste at all.<PAGE>If he sticks to the recipes, he can make food that'll 
put a pro chef to shame. But when he goes by 
his own tastes, well...you saw what happens.

## POINTER 44
<STR>(RIT)
So he was trying to use his own judgment and 
make it taste better than the recipe...

## POINTER 45
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(FRE)'s cooking is a dangerous and volatile 
weapon. I feel sorry for those judges.

## POINTER 46

And now!! It's time 
for the verdict. The 
judges have chosen...

## POINTER 47

...The Guilds! Chef 
<STR>(RAV) is the winner!

## POINTER 48
<STR>(RIT)
I really thought the old man would 
have slacked off more than he did.

## POINTER 49
<STR>(FRE)
I have to hand it to you. There is still 
much that I must learn from you about 
both the culinary arts and the sword.

## POINTER 50
<STR>(RAV)
I use a bow, you know...

## POINTER 51
Sodia
This can't be right! Let 
me taste that food!

## POINTER 52
Witcher
Sodia, no offense to the acting 
commandant, but I believe that's 
simply too dangerous.

## POINTER 53

In recognition for your victory, Chef 
<STR>(RAV), we're awarding you the 
prestigious title of Weekend Chef!<PAGE>Congratulations!

## POINTER 54

...The empire! Chef 
<STR>(FRE) is the winner!

## POINTER 55
<STR>(FRE)
Thank you.

## POINTER 56
<STR>(RAV)
Losin' ta cookin' that bad 
is a bit of a downer...

## POINTER 57
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(FRE)'s food tasted terrible, 
but it was very good in 
the two other categories.

## POINTER 58
<STR>(YUR)
Looks like the rules were 
just in his favor. Oh well.

## POINTER 59

We'll be looking forward to giving 
the Guild's team a chance to 
redeem themselves next year!

## POINTER 60

And this brings the first annual 
Fortune's Banquet exhibition match 
to an end! See you all next year!
