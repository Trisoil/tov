<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS38_103)Man... I was really worried 
there for a while.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS38_104)We were pretty lucky 
that bruiser was in a 
mood for conversation.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_105)Poor <STR>(RAV)'s heart 
can't handle that 
sorta stuff anymore.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_106)If he really wanted to 
kill <STR>(EST_P), he'd have 
attacked us immediately...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_107)That's what I can't figure out.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_108)I imagine Phaeroh was 
conflicted as well.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_109)He hid himself from us 
in the desert to see just 
what we were made of.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS38_110)Huh. Maybe he wasn't as 
bad as we thought, after all?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_111)You might be right.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_112)I get the feeling he'd do 
whatever's necessary 
when push comes to shove.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS38_113)That sounds like you.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_114)...Maybe.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS38_115)But what are we 
gonna do, <STR>(YUR)? You 
heard what he said.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_116)We're going to fix the 
problems the aer's 
causing. That's all.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS38_117)That's easier said than 
done. We're pretty much 
at square one, ya know.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS38_118)There's no doubt that the 
formulas are related somehow 
to the aer getting used up.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_119)We need to find out about 
the ancient blastia, and if 
they went berserk or not.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_120)If we had that kind of information, 
it might give us a clue...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_121)Ask those who have 
inherited the sins of the 
past about the days of old...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_122)Or at least that's what Phaeroh said.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_123)The Kritya were the ones 
to invent the blastia.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_124)In other words, we need to ask 
a Krityan who is still familiar 
with the old stories.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS38_125)Yeah. The Kritya are 
often credited as the 
inventors of the blastia...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_126)There isn't much 
left of the Krityan 
city of Temza, though.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_127)Things might be different if we 
had somewhere else to look.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_128)The hidden city of Myorzo.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_129)It is far older than Temza, and 
the birthplace of the Kritya.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_130)The first blastia 
also originated there.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS38_131)Really? Well, whaddya know.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_132)You wouldn't happen ta 
know where this Myorzo 
might be, would ya, darlin'?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_133)Hmm...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS38_134)I've heard that 
name somewhere...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS38_135)There was a Krityan in Aspio. 
I'm sure they mentioned 
something about it.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS38_136)Do you think that person 
might still be there?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_137)Well, there's no harm 
in checking it out.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS38_138)<STR>(JUD)...are you 
coming with us?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS38_139)...I should. We still have 
the issue of the guild 
to straighten out.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS38_140)So, to Aspio then.
