Are you really going to destroy it?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
Like <STR>(YUR) said, no matter how 
much people swear that they're 
not going to use blastia...<PAGE>...The temptation is too great. Someone will 
inevitably show up who wants to use it again.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
That's why we have to make absolutely sure that 
it will never be able to function again.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
I see... I guess there's no other 
choice than to destroy it...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Ah, that's not true, actually.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
Really?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
If we take away the blastia's core, 
it won't be able to be used.<PAGE>So we can take the core out, and then use spirit 
conversion on it. Then we'll be in the clear!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
But isn't that stealing...?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Yes, it is. That's why we wanted 
to do this ourselves...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
No, I think at this point our only choice 
is to make <STR>(EST_P) an accomplice.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Whawhawhaaa?!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
To make it so they
don't know we've
taken the core,<PAGE>We should really tear up the warehouse and everything around it. They 
won't notice the core's missing in all the mess. What do you think?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Whawhawhaaa?!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Good idea. Maybe we can put some scratches 
on the blastia body as well...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
I guess this is the only way we can do it.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
I have to say, I was quite 
pleased that you figured 
out my plan so quickly.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
What are you saying? It was 
a cinch to see what you 
were thinking of doing.<PAGE>You were trying not to involve <STR>(EST_P) 
and everyone else, right?<PAGE>Though I guess there's not much 
point in that anymore...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
I-I'm sorry...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Come on... You didn't have 
to go to all that trouble.<PAGE>You could get things done a lot 
easier if you would just tell 
<STR>(FRE) and His Royal Highness...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
Do you want to go in 
there with us, too?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
Huh? Is someone there?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Oops...I think that's my cue to exit stage right.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
Well, now that we're all here, 
let's go do a bang-up job!
