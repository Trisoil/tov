## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS27_002)Yep, otherwise known as the Coliseum City.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS27_003)Once popular among the nobility as 
a place for pitting criminals against 
each other in brutal contest...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS27_004)...Nordopolica is currently run by 
the guild Palestralle, and has 
become a city of entertainment.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS27_005)Yeah, Palestralle's just 
as big a guild as the Don's 
Altosk, and...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS27_006)My, how pretty.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS27_007)So, a party in the streets everyday, 
huh? This is gonna be great!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS27_008)Since when are you 
on vacation?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS27_009)Oh yeah, right... A minion's 
work is never done.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS27_010)You're the Don's messenger, 
so don't be rude to Belius!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS27_011)Young man, you are looking at a 
veritable paragon of manners and 
good breeding. Nya hah hah hah.

<VOICE>(VS27_012)We've arrived safely, 
thanks to you all.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS27_013)Once I've unloaded my 
cargo, the Fiertia belongs 
to you, as promised.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS27_014)Thanks! We'll take 
good care of her.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS27_015)So are the Sands of Kogorh 
still a long way from here?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS27_016)They lie far to the 
west of Nordopolica.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS27_017)Aren't there some big 
mountains on the way there?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS27_018)That'd make going by foot 
a problem. Wonder if we 
could get there by boat.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS27_019)I don't think that's possible.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS27_020)Not many people go to the 
desert. I doubt there would 
be a place to moor a boat.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS27_021)Are you seriously going through 
with this? I told you, the desert 
is really dangerous.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS27_022)I can't just let you go 
to a place like that all 
by your... I-I mean...!
