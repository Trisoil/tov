Hey old man, there's something 
I've been wondering.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
What?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
How come the Royal 
Guard is so loyal 
to Alexei?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Well, did you know that most of 
the Imperial Knights are taken as 
apprentices from the nobility?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I wish I could forget.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Well, the Royal Guard protects the emperor, 
and they're made up of the finest soldiers 
in the Imperial Knights.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Hasn't it been several years since 
we've had an emperor, though?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Exactly. In that time, the Commandant's 
cleverly made those knights into 
his own personal army.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
It doesn't seem like that'd be enough to turn 
them into such little lapdogs, though.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Well, the ideals he offered them were 
attractive in their own ways.<PAGE>"Lead our empire to prosperity!" 
and what have ya.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
I'll bet there were a lot of 
idealists in their ranks.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
...Like <STR>(FRE), you mean?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
It'd be nice if all of them could've 
figured out the truth on their 
own like that one...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
