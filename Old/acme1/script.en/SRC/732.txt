Your magic is really 
amazing, <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Wh-why do you say that? And...it 
took you long enough to say so!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
It's just that you were using 
a really rare type of magic.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Oh yeah, shadow magic? Yep. It's 
not something you see everyday.<PAGE>The formulas themselves are 
rare, so you hardly ever 
see people using them.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, wow. It's rare to 
hear you talking about 
artes so happily.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Hmph. Say what you like. I just 
like shadow magic a lot.<PAGE>My whole interest in magic started 
when I saw a formula for shadow 
magic back when I was really little.<PAGE>I'm happy to be able to use it.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
...When you were little, huh? 
Who was it that showed you it?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
I don't remember. The magic itself left 
too strong of an impression for me to 
remember who was doing it, I guess.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
......

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
Wh-what is it?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
No, nothing.<PAGE>......

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
...You're weird.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
When you were young...
The shadow magic you saw was
his own creation...
