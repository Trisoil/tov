...Do you hear that voice...?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
Sounds like a kid's voice ta me.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
What would a child be doing in a place like this...?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, you poor thing...there there...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, let me see 
it for a second.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Stop crying, you!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
You can't just expect it to stop crying if you ask...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Wow... <STR>(RIT), you've really 
got a mother's touch!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
What's that supposed to mean...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, do you think this child was abandoned by its parents?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
If so, we should probably take it 
to the knights to take care of.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
But it's so late to 
be doing that...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
...We might as well wait until the morning. 
We can look after this little one until then.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
...I'll pass.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
W-why?!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
I'm really sorry, but I'm not too 
good with children so young that 
they can't even understand me.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
I'll have to bow out on this one, too. It's 
so small, I'm afraid of breaking it...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
Ya really think I look like 
I'd make a good babysitter?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Well, I think...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
Ugh, whatever! You 
all are useless!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
B-but I hadn't even 
said anything yet...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
Let's go, <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, uh, all right...!
