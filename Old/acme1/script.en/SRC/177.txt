Argh, what the hell! Who rides 
a monster like that!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
That was the dragon rider.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Dragon rider? More like 
dragon freak! Hurting my 
blastia like that!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
"Dragon freak"...*sigh* You know, <STR>(RIT), 
that blastia wasn't even yours.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Anyway, why do you think 
someone would go around 
destroying blastia?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
That's a good question. I'd like 
to sit down and pick that dragon 
rider's brain sometime.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
As if you could have a normal conversation 
with someone like that!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Do you think you can go home by yourself?

## POINTER 8

You're going to go get that bad 
Ragou person, aren't you?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, we want to hurry.

## POINTER 10

It's okay. I can go 
home by myself.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
There's a good boy.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
...<STR>(EST_P), what's the matter?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
I still can't believe the 
magistrate could do such 
terrible things...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Sadly, it's pretty common.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Haven't you already seen what 
the empire's capable of several 
times on this trip already?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
While you guys are having a nice little 
chat, Ragou's escaping in his ship!
