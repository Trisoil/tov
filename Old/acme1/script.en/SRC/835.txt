I can use this ta 
learn weapon skills.

can be used to learn artes even 
without the weapons equipped!

Really? Ya don't say...

In effetti, they say that 
weapon skills are buried deep 
under a person's skin.<PAGE>And the weapons are nothing 
more than a key to bring 
them out! Or so I hear...

these things.
