Hey, you hear about the blastia 
in the lower quarter?

## POINTER 1

Yes, I heard something about it breaking 
and them collecting money to fix it.

## POINTER 2

That's right, I hear that lot went so far as 
to sell their treasures to save up the money.

## POINTER 3

Treasures, sir?

## POINTER 4

Worthless junk, nothing more. They wouldn't 
have gotten more than one Gald for them.

## POINTER 5

Not even one Gald?! I can't imagine what 
sort of treasures those would have to be. 
I'd like to have a look, myself...

## POINTER 6

I'm telling you, nothing 
but junk! Heh heh...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Listen to those guys! Poor Hanks. 
Can't really argue with them about 
the junk thing, though.

## POINTER 8

Ack!

## POINTER 9

What the... Who's there?!

## POINTER 10

Oof!

## POINTER 11

If you can't understand the value of "junk," 
you're worth less than junk yourself.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(RAP), can you find the trail?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
...So they've been taking blastia 
cores from here, too. Looks like somebody's 
got some sticky fingers.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
That's the royal quarter for you. 
A few blastia cores go missing, 
and no one even makes a fuss.<PAGE>When just one is enough to throw 
the lower quarter into chaos.<PAGE>If they've got cores to spare, they 
could stand to give us some!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Found it!
