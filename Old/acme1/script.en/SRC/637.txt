Efreet
<VOICE>(VA027_001)When faced with a daunting foe, 
they often betray their comrades 
and save themselves.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA027_002)They gain more power than 
they need, and grow over-
confident once they have it.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA027_003)This had been my understanding 
of human nature.

## POINTER 1
Undine
<VOICE>(VA027_004)Humans are quite interesting. 
They become distrustful 
once betrayed.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA027_005)One moment they may slander 
a friend, and the next be 
moved to feelings of love.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA027_006)Their hearts may grow more 
compassionate, or be lost to 
depravity. Truly puzzling creatures.

## POINTER 2
Sylph
<VOICE>(VA027_007)All of that makes them dangerous.
How long until they are drowned 
by their thirst for power?<PAGE><VOICE>(VA027_008)How long until they betray all 
those dear to them, in their 
struggle for supremacy?<PAGE><VOICE>(VA027_009)When they stand before 
a mighty enemy, will they 
keep their resolve?

## POINTER 4
Undine
<VOICE>(VA027_011)Do you not believe 
in them, Sylph?

## POINTER 5
Sylph
<VOICE>(VA027_012)I wished only to convey the 
delicacy of the situation.

## POINTER 6
Efreet
<VOICE>(VA027_013)Should they ever become too 
great a nuisance, we need only 
burn them to the ground.

## POINTER 7
Undine
<VOICE>(VA027_014)It seems that the conversion 
to spirit form has not tempered 
our leader's fiery wrath.

## POINTER 8
Sylph
<VOICE>(VA027_015)Nor has there been any change 
in the optimism that so 
characterized you, Undine.

## POINTER 9
Efreet
<VOICE>(VA027_016)And you remain every bit 
as cautious and careful 
as you ever were.

## POINTER 10
Undine
<VOICE>(VA027_017)Has not that fear kept you 
in constant concern over 
the catastrophe in the sky?

## POINTER 11
Sylph
<VOICE>(VA027_018)It was all the Entelexeia 
and humans could do to seal 
it away 1,000 years ago.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA027_019)The humans have said that as 
spirits we possess the power 
to defeat it. However...

## POINTER 12
Undine
<VOICE>(VA027_020)Say no more. Speaking 
it out loud will only further 
increase your worry.

## POINTER 13
Efreet
<VOICE>(VA027_021)We are a new power that will form 
the cornerstone of this world. 
The Adephagos is nothing.

## POINTER 14
Sylph
<VOICE>(VA027_022)We may possess enough power to defeat 
the Adephagos once and for all.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA027_023)But all our work will have been 
for naught if the humans cannot 
face this threat.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA027_024)Do not forget that it is the 
mortals who must use our powers 
against the Adephagos.

## POINTER 15
Undine
<VOICE>(VA027_025)Did you not place your 
faith in their hands?

## POINTER 16
Sylph
<VOICE>(VA027_026)As there are no others to whom we can turn... 
I will entrust them with our final hope.

## POINTER 17
Undine
<VOICE>(VA027_027)Then be content to stand by, and 
watch over them. Believe in them.

## POINTER 18
Efreet
<VOICE>(VA027_028)I too await the day when I 
make known my full power.

## POINTER 19
Sylph
<VOICE>(VA027_029)…………

## POINTER 20
Efreet
<VOICE>(VA027_030)Speak, Gnome, if you have 
something we should know.

## POINTER 21
Sylph
<VOICE>(VA027_031)He says "We are left to make 
one of two choices..."<PAGE><VOICE>(VA027_032)"Perish along with this 
world, or entrust our powers 
to the humans..."<PAGE><VOICE>(VA027_033)"They may be fragile, but their hearts 
burn with a determination to live. 
I will stand with them."

## POINTER 22
Undine
<VOICE>(VA027_034)Do you mean it, Gnome?

## POINTER 23
Sylph
<VOICE>(VA027_035)He says, "I, too, share 
their desire to go on living."

## POINTER 24
Efreet
<VOICE>(VA027_036)That is the life for those 
who grow old and die. We must 
live as suits our nature.

## POINTER 25
Undine
<VOICE>(VA027_037)No. Like them, the oncoming 
catastrophe could sow the 
seeds of our obliteration as well.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA027_038)Gnome, let us, too, struggle 
for as long as we can. 
As the humans do.

## POINTER 26
Undine
<VOICE>(VA027_039)Goodbye...
