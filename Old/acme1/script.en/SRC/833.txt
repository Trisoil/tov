Hey there! Welcome 
to the Kowz Mansion!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Mansion? I don't see 
a building anywhere.

## POINTER 2

Come on, Flatty, you're 
missing the forest 
for the trees!<PAGE>You gotta look 
at the big picture! 
You dig?

## POINTER 3

Now, it's time for everyone's 
favorite tradition... That's right! 
It's item exchange time!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Since when was this everyone's 
favorite tradition?

## POINTER 5

Details, details!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
So ya want something, 
right?

## POINTER 7

No need to be so 
blunt! You're 
right, though.<PAGE>Today's item du jour is gonna 
knock your socks off!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
That sounds like it'd 
be the sort of thing we 
wouldn't even have...

## POINTER 9

If you don't have it, you 
can just make it for me. 
That should be fun!

## POINTER 10

And now, to announce the 
item du jour! Dadum 
dadum dadummm... DUM!<PAGE>It's a Silver Edge +1α! So then, 
whenever you're ready! ∀

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
That's a pretty fancy 
item to be asking for.

## POINTER 12

Well then, it may help to know 
something: I feel like this will
be the last item!<PAGE>You could call it a Kowz's 
sixth sense, perhaps?<PAGE>So then, will you, 
won't you? Do 
you, don't you?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
It wasn't easy, 
but here you go!

## POINTER 14

Ah, swooshy-haired midget, you 
always come through in a pinch! 
You're such a little smarty!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
Is that supposed to 
be a compliment?

## POINTER 16

Round and round we go!
Where we stop...only I know!

## POINTER 17

Here you go! This is 
as good as it gets!

## POINTER 18

Oo hoo! This 
is awesome!
Thankeeee!

## POINTER 19

Awwwwesome!!

## POINTER 20

It looks like A-to-the-L was 
happy. How nice. Now, to give 
you a reward for your help.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
This'd better not
be something lame
again!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, after we worked that 
hard to get it for you!

## POINTER 23

Ding-dong!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
Are you trying to insult us?

## POINTER 25

Can't take a joke, eh? 
No wonder you're such 
a flatty, Flatty.<PAGE>Okay, once again... This 
time it's for real!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
Whoa! Hey, this 
isn't bad at all, 
Li'l K! ∀

## POINTER 27

Hard workers deserve 
appropriate compensation 
for their efforts!<PAGE>There's nothing I hate more 
than when honest people 
are given a bum deal.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, I couldn't 
agree more!

## POINTER 29

You've still got some growing 
up to do, Little Miss Innocent.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, I know. I'll 
do my best!

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RAV)
This haul isn't 
bad at all.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(JUD)
Yes, I think we actually came 
out on top, in the end.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
Well, looks like we made out pretty well.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, thanks 
a lot!

## POINTER 35

Sure, sure! Keep up the good 
work, boys and girls! I'll 
be seeing you later! ∀

## POINTER 36

Ahhhh!!!

## POINTER 37
<STR>(RAV)
What? What? What's 
the matter?

## POINTER 38

Come to think of it, you 
exchanged lots of great things 
with me, didn't you?

## POINTER 39
<STR>(RIT)
Well, it was more like they 
were taken by force...

## POINTER 40

Shut it, Flatty!
Since you've helped 
me out so many times, I've got 
a little something in return.

## POINTER 41
<STR>(EST_P)
Something in return?

## POINTER 42

Yep. Hold on a sec.

## POINTER 43

Sorry about that. 
This is for you!

## POINTER 44

That's all. 
The end! Fin!

## POINTER 45
<STR>(KAR)
So...uh... Are these all the items 
we gave you, only now they've been 
barfed back up...or something?

## POINTER 46
<STR>(RAV)
Hey, who's complainin'? 
These items are great!

## POINTER 47
<STR>(JUD)
You really don't mind 
if we take all this?

## POINTER 48

No, go right ahead. Think of them as a way of showing 
my thanks for everything you've done. They can also 
double as my payment for such delicious eye-candy. ∀

## POINTER 49
<STR>(RIT)
You're really creepy! I hope you know that!

## POINTER 50

You don't have that, do 
you? Hmmm... Maybe it's 
beyond your abilities...

## POINTER 51

Hmph, I expected as much...

## POINTER 52

Oh, did you bring the Silver Edge +1α?
Would you like to shaaare?
