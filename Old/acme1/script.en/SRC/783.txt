What's the matter, <STR>(RAP)?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 2

Wooo!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
...That's your...former 
nemesis!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Say again?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
That's the dog <STR>(YUR) was talking about, 
who used to rule over all of the 
dogs and cats in the capital...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, it's the Little Wolf.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAP)
(It's been a while, Old Man.)

## POINTER 8

(Don't think I've forgotten 
how you drove me out of the 
capital like a common stray.)

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAP)
(We settled everything fair and square in battle. 
You have no right to still hold a grudge.)

## POINTER 10

(You had to go and 
take pity on me...)<PAGE>(Why didn't you just kill me 
when you had the chance?)

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAP)
(I haven't sunk so low as to raise 
a paw against a defeated loser.)

## POINTER 12

(Me, a loser? You filthy 
mutt. I've still never 
lost to you in person.)

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAP)
(So you want to fight mano a mano?)

## POINTER 14

(You catch on quick.)

## POINTER 15

(No, a physical confrontation 
wouldn't be a fair fight.)<PAGE>(It has to be a marking battle.)

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAP)
(What do you mean?)

## POINTER 17

(It's a battle to see which of us can mark more 
places that we go as our own territory.)<PAGE>(A battle spanning the whole globe!)

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RAP)
(Hmmm, sounds pretty interesting...)<PAGE>(You sure you'll be 
able to keep up?)

## POINTER 19

(That's my line. Sit around 
on your haunches and I'm gonna 
leave you in the dust.)

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
Hmph, <STR>(RAP)'ll catch up with him in no time.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
Yeah, I hope so.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
...How long are they going to be doing it?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? Oh, <STR>(RAP), 
you're finished.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
Where'd you go off to, <STR>(EST_P)?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(EST_P)
Here you go, <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
Wh-what's this...?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
You can use this to make notes 
of all of the places where <STR>(RAP)'s 
marked his territory.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? Y-you want me to do it...?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
This sort of thing is what 
Captain <STR>(KAR) does best!

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 32
<STR>(YUR)
We're counting on you!
