The rain's letting up.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
But it's still 
so gloomy...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah... I can't see the sun at all.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Whether it's raining or 
sunny doesn't much affect 
our adventure, anyway.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
That's not true! Different 
monsters come out in 
different weather.<PAGE>There are monsters who can't stand 
water, and others that love it.<PAGE>Monsters have a large effect on 
what we do, don't you think?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(KAR), it's so nice to have a member of the Hunting 
Blades with us who knows about these things!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Well, regardless, we're going 
to have to walk in the rain.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Not necessarily. The weather might 
be different in the morning.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, maybe so.<PAGE>The best cure for a gloomy day like this 
is sleeping it away, nice and cozy.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
...But tomorrow could be just 
as cloudy and dismal as today.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Way to rain on my parade...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
But rainy days aren't 
always so bad!<PAGE>They say all sorts of special things happen on 
rainy days that don't happen when it's sunny.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Is that something else that you read 
in your books? Is that true...?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
...That's what they say.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Well, for now we'll just have to get some 
sleep and wait for the sky to clear up.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Tomorrow might be just 
as rainy as today!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(RIT)... You're pretty mean, you know that?
