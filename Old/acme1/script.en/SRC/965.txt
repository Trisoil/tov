Where do you go off powering the engines for 
something you don't even know how to control?! 
You're going to break something, or worse!<PAGE>You were born from Belius's 
apatheia, so of course you're 
powerful! It's a given!<PAGE>That's why it doesn't prove anything if 
you can move something like that! You cocky, 
ignorant, bloated idiot of a spirit!

<STR>(KAR)

spirit she was "handy"...
Are 
you trying to one-up <STR>(RIT)...?
