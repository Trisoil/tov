Ah...!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
What's with you...?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
These flowers are so pretty...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Hmm...? Hey, that's 
a cyrtanthus bloom.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
You actually know a lot about 
plants, don't you, old man?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Oh, I dabble here and there.â™ª

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Hmph... So what's 
that one called?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Hah? One second, it's 
a...teardrop tulip.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
How about that?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Why, um... That's a, 
uh rainbow flower?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Wrong. Crimson nadesico and beautyberry. 
Some botanist you are.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
I just happened to not know those.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
It looks more like you 
just happened to know 
cyrtanthus bloom.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
No, no, 
really--

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
So, how did you just happen to know 
about these nightshade flowers?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
Argh, listen to me!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Sounds like you've got a special reason.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
...Kind of... Nightshade's just a flower an old 
friend of mine from the Knights used ta like.<PAGE>My friend's room was 
always full of 'em.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
So you have had a couple 
of friends, then.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
You're sayin' that like it surprises 
ya. Poor old <STR>(RAV)'d just curl up 
and die if ya left him all alone.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(JUD)
Just what is the correct response 
when a man starts whining 
like a mouse, I wonder.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
You say, "Oh <STR>(RAV), you big silly, you're so cute."

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
Hah...That's not the word I'd use.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RAV)
Argh...! <STR>(JUD), darlin' 
you're cold as ice.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
...Good grief.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
It's a little like <STR>(FRE) and <STR>(YUR), 
what with you having a friend 
in the Knights, and all.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
Well now, it can't compare ta the shinin' 
example of friendship those two young lads've 
got goin', but yeah. We were pals.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
I don't think of my friendship 
with <STR>(FRE) as "shiny."

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RAV)
Really? But youth's a fleetin' 
thing for all of us. That friendship's 
long past, now.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, did you fight 
about something?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RAV)
Hm, I s'pose ya could call it that.<PAGE>Would ya mind pickin' a few 
of those for me, young miss?

## POINTER 31
<STR>(EST_P)
Hmm? Oh, certainly.
