Huh? What's 
the matter?

## POINTER 1

Hey, <STR>(KAR), 
and <STR>(RAV) 
too!<PAGE>No, it's just...I've 
got something on my 
mind, is all...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
What's up?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Tell us. Maybe Brave 
Vesperia can help.

## POINTER 4

Well, I feel pretty dumb, but...I 
lost the key to the storeroom. I 
can't do any organizing at all!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
This sounds like 
a job fer Captain 
<STR>(KAR)!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? M-me?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
It's all on ya now, 
master lockpicker!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
This lock looks pretty old. 
I don't think I can get 
it unlocked. I'm sorry...

## POINTER 9

Is that so...
I wonder what 
I should do, then...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
Aha! I'm
a genius!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
What? What is it? I've got 
a bad feeling about this...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
Just like last time, 
kid! Hop up! I'll 
give ya a boost.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
We did it!

## POINTER 14

Ohh, thank 
you! You did 
great!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
What else did ya expect 
from the great <STR>(RAV)?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
But all you did was 
give me a boost up!

## POINTER 17

I can't thank you enough. 
You can have whatever's 
in the storeroom.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
But weren't you planning 
on tidying up 
your things?

## POINTER 19

Well, I was originally planning on reorganizing 
all of my boxes, and I'm sure that a lot of 
them would've ended up getting thrown away.<PAGE>And I need to give 
you a reward for the 
work that you did!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
Okay, but don't you think 
this is a bit much...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
It sounds okay to me. After 
all, it's a reward fer hard 
work done by Brave Vesperia!

## POINTER 22

Frankly, I don't 
really even know 
what's in there.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
All right, then 
we'll take 
it! Thanks!

## POINTER 24

Thanks for your help. If I ever 
have another problem, I'll be 
sure to ask Brave Vesperia!
