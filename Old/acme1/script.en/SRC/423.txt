There are so many types of blastia 
I've never seen before...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Looks like the Krityans really were the ones 
who created blastia in the first place.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
...Yes. Seeing all this 
blastia makes it very easy 
to believe that.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
It sure would be nice if we happened 
upon a way to do something about 
your power, Miss <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Really...that would 
be nice, but...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
...It's not working.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
It doesn't have a core. It's just the body.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
This city has stopped using blastia. 
What you see here is what everyone 
threw out long ago.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Why would they do that?

## POINTER 9

Because that was the 
path we chose.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
It's been a long time, Elder.

## POINTER 11

So you were the cause of all 
of this commotion outside! 
You've returned to us.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
These children are humans who 
are travelling with me.

## POINTER 13

Hmph.

## POINTER 14

This is...blastia, 
is it not?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Yes. It's my bodhi blastia that I use.

## POINTER 16

Hmmm. I thought that earth-dwellers 
had stopped using blastia 
like us...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
Do you not use the blastia 
here because it uses a special 
formula, too?

## POINTER 18

There are no normal or special types of blastia.

## POINTER 19

Blastia is made by crushing apatheia, and processing 
those pieces with technology to produce cores, 
and through the absorption of aer...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Hold it! Cores are made 
from crushed apatheia?!

## POINTER 21

Indeed, that is what the stories 
say. It appears apatheia was too 
powerful in its original form.<PAGE>Even without that power, it is a stone 
more valuable than any precious gem.<PAGE>This it why its power was restrained by breaking 
it into pieces and carving formulas into it, 
and thus its numbers were also increased.<PAGE>Our legends tell us that cores were 
always produced in this way.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
...A bit ironic, huh?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah...<PAGE>The apatheia that comes from 
Entelexeia, who hate blastia,<PAGE>is necessary to make the very 
blastia that they hate...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAV)
Maybe Phaeroh didn't tell us about 
apatheia 'cause he felt uncomfortable 
talkin' about it...y'think?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(JUD)
Elder. There are many things 
I'd like to ask you about.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
We're trying to find out 
what sort of role blastia 
played in ancient times.<PAGE>And if blastia ever brought disasters to this world, 
we'd like to know how they might have been stopped.<PAGE>Myorzo must still have 
some folklore, right?<PAGE>Perhaps you could tell us what you know.

## POINTER 27

Hmph. Very well.<PAGE>My home would be a better place 
to speak of such things. Please 
go inside and wait for me there.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RAV)
Hey there. Where are you goin'?

## POINTER 29

I was in the middle of my daily walk. I'll 
return to my house before too long.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(EST_P)
...

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
Apatheia, blastia, aer disturbances, 
Entelexeia... It looks like everything's 
connected.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(RIT)
We might see even more connections once 
he's told us the Krityan folklore.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(JUD)
The Elder's house is the large 
building with a differently colored 
roof than all the others.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
Gotcha.
