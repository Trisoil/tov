## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
What have you been doing 
in this town since all 
of its people left?

## POINTER 2

As my fellow Krityans left for 
their new home in the sky, I 
too needed a place of refuge.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
You didn't go with them?

## POINTER 4

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)

here all by yourself...

## POINTER 6

On the contrary, a pleasing 
calm settled over this place 
after everyone had moved on.
