What's with all these people here?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(KAR)'s over there!

## POINTER 2

The Don protected this city from the 
empire...he protected our honor!

## POINTER 3

Even if we're the only ones helping, we 
owe it to the Don to protect the city!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
Hold your horses! Settle down, all 
of you. What's all this commotion?

## POINTER 5

We've heard that a group 
from Palestralle has been 
spotted near Heliord!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
Their leader got killed thanks to a mistake 
of one of our own. It's only natural they'd 
wanna talk about the incident.

## POINTER 7

Once they learn the Don's left 
town, things could get ugly!<PAGE>We must defend the 
city from them until 
Don returns!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
You fools. If y'all weren't so eager 
to fight, the Don wouldn't've had 
to leave in the first place...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Soon as they learn that there's 
fighting between guilds...<PAGE>Dontcha think the Knights are bound to stick 
their noses in our business again?

## POINTER 10

Dahngrest is independent 
from the empire!<PAGE>The Imperial Knights are in no 
place to tell us what to do!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
The friendship treaty still ain't 
finalized yet, you know...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(YUR)! Everyone! What do we do? This 
is going to become a war between guilds 
if we don't do something!<PAGE>If only the Don were here...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
They say that the Don may have 
gone to the Leviathan's Claw 
compound, the Manor of the Wicked.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
What! Really?!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
Well...probably so...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
We were about to see if we could 
go there. Wanna come with us?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
But...there's a chance that 
the Don's not there, right?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah, it was just the old 
man's intuition, after all.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
If he's not there...<PAGE>War could break out while we're 
out looking for him...<PAGE><STR>(YUR)...what should we do...? 
What would be best...?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
Well, we should be able to handle 
the Manor of the Wicked ourselves.<PAGE>You go ahead and do what 
you think you should do.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
Y-yeah...then I'm going to 
go and talk to everyone!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
Do you think this is the right choice?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
We don't have much choice. We 
can't follow the Don and guard 
the city at the same time.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
I hope that we find the Don 
at the Manor of the Wicked...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
We're his backup.<PAGE>If Yeager's the one the Don's 
up against, he'll need all 
the help he can get.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
Hey, do ya even know where yer going?! 
It's straight ta the west of here!<PAGE>Hey, wait for meee!
