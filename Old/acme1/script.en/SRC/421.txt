## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_002)Forget the city! What about

<VOICE>(VS40_003)It's an Entelexeia. Though 
not one I've spoken to.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_004)An Entelexeia?! How 
did something like that 
swallow an entire city?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_005)That I don't know.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS40_006)I had absolutely no idea a

<VOICE>(VS40_007)That is because Myorzo

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_008)It's not gonna attack

get closer, right?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_009)Don't worry. As long as 
Ba'ul is with us, we should 
be allowed to enter.
