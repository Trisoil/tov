<STR>(KAR)
The flowers are blooming so beautifully today...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
It must be because of the ghost!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, it must be! â™ª

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Hey, speakin' of ghosts, where's <STR>(RIT)?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
She said something about looking at 
a blastia, and climbed up the tree.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
She's certainly got a lot of energy.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
I've read that Halure's name comes from the three types of trees: 
the harmonea, the luluria, and the reren. The beginnings of 
their names come together to form the name of the town...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Spoken like a true bookworm, 
born and bred.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
...I don't see what's 
so wrong about that...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
I've made up my mind. Once we're done with 
our journey, I'm going to live here.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? You're not going back to the castle?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
I can go to the castle from 
here, if I need to.<PAGE>If I spend all of my time cooped up 
in the castle, I'm afraid I'll get 
swept up in all of the chaos there.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
So why not just leave all 
that castle stuff ta Master 
Ioder so ya can relax?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
I can't do that!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(EST_P) can't just spend her life 
goofing off like you can, Old Man.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
Now hold on, ol' <STR>(RAV)'s living 
his life pretty seriously, 
I'll have ya know.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Really? How so?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
Whaddaya mean "how so"...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
What a silly conversation... You 
all don't have anything more productive 
you could be doing?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
This from the tree-climbing blastia hunter...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
I'll have you know, I've been examining the blastia 
here to evaluate its potential for spirit conversion.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
So, did you discover anything?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
It's no good. The blastia here is resonating 
with Halure's tree, and it's making some sort 
of configuration I've never seen before.<PAGE>It does seem like it's made an elemental 
spirit on its own...as I suspected.<PAGE>But we're short on time right now, so I'll have 
to come back later to study it some more...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
R-really?!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
...Huh? Well, yeah...<PAGE>...What's up with you...?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(JUD)
<STR>(EST_P) was just telling us how she wants 
to live here once our journey is over.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
Really...? Oh, I, I see..

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
All right, then if I'm not mistaken, we have 
an Adephagos we need to go take care of.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes.
