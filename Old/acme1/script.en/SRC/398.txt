It's even worse from up close.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
There's no way this could 
have happened naturally.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
It looks like something exploded here...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
An explosion... Are there 
monsters that can do something 
like this?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
There were. But those monsters 
were all wiped out.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
What do you mean, 
wiped out?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
What ya see here...this was a 
battleground in the Great War.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
What! Really?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
So that means...humans 
and Entelexeia fought 
here...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
The humans were victorious, 
but there were scarcely 
any survivors...<PAGE>The facts behind the war are 
shrouded in darkness...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Not even the official government histories 
give many details about what happened.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
So the Entelexeia did this 
to the mountains...<PAGE>What terrible power.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
But this is the first time I've heard 
that a battle took place here.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
The empire's kept a pretty tight 
hold on information about it.<PAGE>They've got a lotta secrets. 
You should know that by now.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
I thought it was strange that 
monsters would wage war against 
humans. But...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
What they didn't want us to 
know was that those monsters 
were actually Entelexeia...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
You sure know a lot about this stuff, <STR>(RAV).

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
You come across a lot if you 
live long enough, kiddies.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Okay, enough history lessons. 
We came here so we could 
look for <STR>(JUD_P).

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
The monster's voice we heard 
just now... What if they've already 
got <STR>(JUD) cornered?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Beating up that dragon-freak 
is MY job!<PAGE>I won't let them beat me to it!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
Let's hurry!
