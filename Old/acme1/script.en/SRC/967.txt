The steam...
It went away...

I have stored enough for the battle with the Adephagos. 
With this, you may banish all worries from your minds.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
That's all well and good, but are you sure 
it's okay to do something like that?

## POINTER 3

I have only taken energy from 
the upper crust of the ground. 
You need not be apprehensive.<PAGE>With the passage of time, eventually the surface 
will return to its original level of activity.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
I guess that's okay, then.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)

Doesn't that make it worth it?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
If we can land there and find 
something good, it does.
