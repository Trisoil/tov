<STR>(RAP)
Woo, woof!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
They're behind us!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Our party's order is in shambles!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Be careful! We'll be fine 
if we proceed with caution!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
It looks like they've 
messed up our order... 
Let's take 'em down!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Uh, w-what the...I was leading up the rear 
of the party, and now I'm in front?!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
I, um, I was in the back 
last time I checked...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, attacking from 
behind is no fair!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
What the...! I was having so much 
fun goofing off in the back of 
the party... Okay, let's go!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
That was scary... I didn't expect to 
be ambushed from behind like that.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Well, I guess we just can't 
ever let our guard down where 
there are monsters about.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
If they attack from the 
rear, any of us could 
get pulled into battle.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Right...Let's be careful and hope
that doesn't happen again.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Hmm. This only happens
with a preemptive attack.

## POINTER 14
Information
Your party's order will be
reshuffled when an enemy 
approaches from behind,
so be careful!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Preemptive attacks, eh...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
What?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
You guys!
It's back!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
Hit it with what I
gave you just now!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? You mean with this...?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Do it, now!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
I get it now, so
that's how it works.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
I didn't know it can be
used like that, too.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
Right. Let's get
a move on.

## POINTER 24

Sorcerer's Ring at an enemy
