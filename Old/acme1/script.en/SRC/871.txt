Yes...I wonder if 
we're safe now.

## POINTER 2

Hard to say. Those guys 
are a sticky lot.

Woof!

Hello!

Welcome, good travelers! ♪

<STR>(EST_P)
...Is this a shop?

## POINTER 10

...It's the King of Adventure Travelers' Lodge...

## POINTER 11

Oh, big brother, do try to 
be a bit more friendly! ∀

Please, you'll have to excuse him. 
My name is Karen, and this is Rich.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
You're operating 
a traveling inn?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Doesn't the "King of Adventure" 
refer to something else...something 
more well-known?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
The late emperor's brother, His Highness 
Regin, was known by that name thanks to 
his insatiable thirst for adventure.

## POINTER 17
Karen
Indeed! We took our name from 
His Highness Regin. It's true.

## POINTER 18
Rich
...We respect 
him...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm, that's a pretty 
nice name, then.

## POINTER 20
Karen
So are the two of you married?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
M-married...? 
I, I...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Do we look like we're married?

## POINTER 23
Karen
Oh? It seems I was mistaken. 
So very sorry!<PAGE>If you're tired, perhaps you'd 
like to stay the night?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
Wh-what should we do?

## POINTER 25
Do you want to rest?
Rest
Do not rest

## POINTER 26

Sure, we'll sleep here.

Excellent! Thank you very much!

N-no, it's quite all right...

## POINTER 31
Karen
Did you rest 
well?

I do hope our paths will

## POINTER 34

Yes, I hope 
so, too!

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
Sorry, I think we'll pass 
this time. We're kind 
of in a bit of a hurry.
