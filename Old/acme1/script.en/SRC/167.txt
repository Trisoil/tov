Wait! You can't go out again after that girl went
through the trouble of healing your wounds!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Where are you off to with 
that dangerous weapon?

## POINTER 2
Teagle
That's no business of yours. I can't 
have you sticking your nose into my affairs 
just because you're curious!

## POINTER 3
Teagle
Th-this is...?!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Sorry for stealing your thunder 
back at the inn. Maybe this'll 
make it up to you.

## POINTER 5
Teagle
Th-thank you so much!

## POINTER 6
Kellas
Th-thank you so much!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
H-hold on! You're just 
giving it to them?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
It's a small price to pay if 
it saves their child's life.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
You were planning on doing this 
from the beginning, weren't you?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Nope, it just came to me.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
You do realize that you just gave 
away our gift for the magistrate, 
right? Now what'll we do?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
No worries, we'll just find some other 
way to get into the magistrate's place.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Shall we see how <STR>(FRE)'s 
doing, then?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Yes, maybe he's even gotten into Ragou's 
palace already and set things straight!!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, that sure would be nice...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
Let's go pay a visit to the inn.
