What is this a statue of?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
This is a temple, after all. This is probably a statue 
of whatever deity the temple was dedicated to.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
You know, it might just be a statue of 
the Entelexeia we just saw outside.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? It couldn't be...I mean, a 
monster....that is, it's a...but 
they don't even look alike...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
No, I think it's 
possible.<PAGE>The Entelexeia have powers beyond those of 
humans, and can speak in our language.<PAGE>It's not strange to think that humans would've 
worshipped them in ancient times.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
The relationship between the 
Entelexeia and humans might 
be closer than we thought.<PAGE>Maybe they drifted apart during the long, 
long passage of time, eventually leading to 
the situation we find ourselves in now.

<STR>(KAR)
I-I think that I prefer the distance 
we have now to the cozy relationship 
we had back then, heh...heh...
