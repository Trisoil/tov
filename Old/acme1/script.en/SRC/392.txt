<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_210)...<STR>(KAR)... Do you think 
he'll be all right...?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_211)He'll be fine.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_212)But...

## POINTER 3
Yeager
<VOICE>(VS36_213)Well now, if it isn't the darling 
boy and girl. How very nice 
to see you both.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_214)Yeager...!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_215)You've got some nerve 
showing your face after 
planting the seeds of war.

## POINTER 6
Yeager
<VOICE>(VS36_216)Seeds of war? I'm quite sure I don't 
know what you're talking about.

## POINTER 7
Gauche
<VOICE>(VS36_217)Attacking Palestralle is a matter 
for the Union to decide.

## POINTER 8
Droite
<VOICE>(VS36_218)Yup, that's right. We just helped 
inform their decision.â˜†

## POINTER 9
Yeager
<VOICE>(VS36_219)Exactly. Understand, 
my little friends?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_220)I'll give you something 
to smile about.

## POINTER 11
Yeager
<VOICE>(VS36_221)...That's enough for today, I think.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_222)It is the day of the Don's 
passing, after all.  We're 
still in mourning, you see.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_223)The world lost a great man today, 
it most certainly did.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_224)What is it you guys are after?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_225)Get the Don out of the way to 
take control of the Union?

## POINTER 13
Yeager
<VOICE>(VS36_226)Oh no no no.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_227)Our little business will most 
surely be easier without the 
poor Don around, but...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_228)...Ah, let's not go there. 
...I've come today for my 
own personal reasons.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_229)...I don't want to disgrace 
the Don by doing 
something I'll regret later.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_230)You should leave before 
I change my mind.

## POINTER 15
Yeager
<VOICE>(VS36_231)It is not only you 
who are mourning 
this death, you know.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_232)Be seeing you, then.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_233)Even Yeager is mourning 
the Don...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_234)...I don't understand. Hadn't 
he been trying to get rid 
of Don Whitehorse himself...?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_235)The old man was a nuisance 
to Leviathan's Claw, but...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_236)Maybe things were a little different 
for Yeager on a personal level.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_237)You mean like the 
difference between 
guilds and individuals?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_238)Yeah.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_239)To the Don, there was 
Yeager the boss, and 
Yeager the person.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_240)The Don did break his 
own laws and take the 
fight into his own hands.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_241)Well, we should be on our way.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_242)Ah, all right. I told <STR>(RIT) 
we would be meeting her 
at the town exit.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_243)But what about <STR>(KAR)...?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_244)I said he'll be fine. 
Let's go.
