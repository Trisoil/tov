End of the line, boys.

## POINTER 1

They've caught us...!

## POINTER 2

...Our orders were to 
eliminate all witnesses, 
no matter what...!

## POINTER 3

B-but...

## POINTER 4

Enough grumbling, do it!

## POINTER 5

Yes sir...!

## POINTER 6

I'll just use this...

## POINTER 7

Agh!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
Say goodbye!

## POINTER 9

Gaah!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Argh, this wouldn't happen if amateurs would 
keep their clumsy hands away from blastia!

## POINTER 11

Eeeek!

## POINTER 12

Damn it, you just wait...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(RIT), it's not safe!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
B-but...
Oh no, the core 
is burnt to a crisp...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
It's too late...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Did your walk have to do with going 
after this blastia, by any chance?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
What could you possibly be talking about...?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Well, it ended up destroyed 
in the end, anyway.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(JUD)
......

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
It's gotta be hard doing it all by yourself, 
trying to keep it all a secret from everyone.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
I know... You can't even 
go for a nice walk without 
someone butting in.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
...You still won't tell us your reasons 
for going around and destroying blastia?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
...Yeah. I still...think that 
it's something that you're just 
as well off not knowing.
