Oh my... If it isn't <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Hi there. It's been a while, hasn't it?

## POINTER 2
Rhianna
And all of you...
You're <STR>(KAR)'s friends, then?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Miss Rhianna, I'd like you 
to meet my new guildmates.

## POINTER 4
Rhianna
I heard you've gone from guild to 
guild. I think it's time for you to 
grow up and commit to something.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Um, actually, this time I'm 
in it for the long haul...

## POINTER 6
Rhianna
Oh you are? Well then, you must 
finally have been blessed with a truly 
understanding group of friends.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, I have. And I heard 
that you're engaged to be 
married... Congratulations.

## POINTER 8
Rhianna
Yes, that's right. 
Thank you.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Speaking of your high-strung 
groom-to-be...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
...I-I beg your pardon. He's actually 
referring to the necklace given 
to you by your fiance...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
You did say your father had 
fashioned the necklace out 
of Everlight himself, did you not?

## POINTER 12
Rhianna
That's correct.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
We've heard that Everlight 
can only be forged using 
a very specific process.<PAGE>We were wondering how it was 
your father might have come 
to know such a thing...

## POINTER 14
Rhianna
I'm afraid only my father 
could answer that.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
Hmm. Any idea where we might 
find him about now...?

## POINTER 16
Rhianna
He is no longer with us, 
unfortunately. He passed 
away quite some time ago.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
Then, that means...

## POINTER 18
Rhianna
He belonged to a metal-working 
guild, though. Perhaps 
they could help you.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
Really?!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
Where could we find the other 
members of that guild?

## POINTER 21
Rhianna
Another continent lies across the 
seas to the west of Dahngrest.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
That's the continent 
of Yurzorea, right?

## POINTER 23
Rhianna
Yes. A strange little town 
exists on the continent's 
northern-most reaches.<PAGE>I have never been myself, but they 
called themselves the "Galactic 
Gearbox" and have a shop there.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
Thanks a lot! 
We owe you one!<PAGE>...Let's roll!

## POINTER 25
Rhianna
Here now, <STR>(KAR). You 
should know by now that 
haste makes waste.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(KAR)
Oops, um, sorry...

## POINTER 27
Rhianna
I can't promise that my 
father's guildmates will 
know anything at all.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(KAR)
That's okay! We'll just go see!

## POINTER 29
Rhianna
Keep your friends close to you, 
and give it your very best.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(KAR)
I-I will!

## POINTER 31
Rhianna
Please continue looking 
after <STR>(KAR) for me.
