Sooo tired.... Ol' <STR>(RAV)'s 
beat, kids. Tarqaron's just 
too big, I tell ya!<PAGE>Come on, let's take a load off! A little 
nap in the lovin' lap of sweet <STR>(JUD) and 
I'll be back ta full health in a jiffy...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Ugh...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
And just when I thought you'd 
turned a new leaf, <STR>(RAV).

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
That outfit doesn't look so believable on you anymore.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
Hey hey, <STR>(JUD) baby, whaddaya say?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
I know a much better way to get some 
nice sleep than lying in my lap.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
Ohhh? âˆ€

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
You might find it a little hard to wake up, though.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Whatever it takes, <STR>(JUD), 
just make him shut up!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
You're sure cold. Treat yer elders 
a little nicer, won't ya?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
It's nice to know we've still 
got the same old <STR>(RAV) with us.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
I can't imagine <STR>(RAV) 
as Captain Schwann 
anymore...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, maybe he was only plain 
old <STR>(RAV), after all...
