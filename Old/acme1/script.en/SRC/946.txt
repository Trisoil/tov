...Ugh, I'm sick of these stupid traps...!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
How many times do we have to fall in these before you're happy?!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
It's the fault of these stupid 
paths for being so narrow!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
H-hey, it's not like I'm trying to fall in...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
That was the third time, if I'm not mistaken.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Uh, but you're the one leading the party, <STR>(RIT)...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
I can't take it anymore...
Just a second.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
What are you doing?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
This wouldn't be happening to us if we could see

<STR>(RIT)

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
The word "impossible" isn't 
in my dictionary! I ripped that 
page out. Let's go.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, it's so bright. We should 
be just fine now.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
All right, let's go.
