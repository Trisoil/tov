## POINTER 0

You're very graceful 
as you move... 
It's fantastic!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Really? Maybe it's because 
I like working with 
other people so much.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
It sounds like your good breeding 
is showing through.

## POINTER 3

Oh, really? That ought to attract customers, 
too. We don't have many people of proper 
upbringing around these parts.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
I don't think I did 
anything special...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Your "nothing special" is different 
from ours, <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 6

Do you think you'll 
come and help again?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Y-yes, if I 
could help...

## POINTER 8

Thank you. Here, take this. It's my 
best attempt at a uniform for you.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, not bad. Why not 
try it on right now?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Sure!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
What do you think?

## POINTER 12

It looks great on you. Please 
come back and help again soon.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Phew! I worked my butt off!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Good job, <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 15

You sure do work 
hard for a kid!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
For a kid? What's 
that supposed 
to mean?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(KAR), it was a compliment.

## POINTER 18

Please come back and help out 
again sometime. I've even made 
a special uniform for you.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
Really? Sweet! Thank 
you! I'll try it 
on right now.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
......
I look like 
a lunchlady.

## POINTER 21

There's nothing cuter than 
a kid wearing an apron!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
Phew! Well, that 
about does it.

## POINTER 23

Amazing! You handled 
so many customers with 
such finesse...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
Well, she is a genius mage, after all.

## POINTER 25

I could really use some employees who 
know how to go with the flow... How 
about you work for me full-time?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
You've gotta be joking. I'll pass.

## POINTER 27

Oh, really? Well, please let me 
know if you change your mind.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(RIT), that's great! Now you have a 
place to go if that whole blastia 
research thing doesn't work out.

## POINTER 29

I'd like you to come and help out again 
sometime, so I've made you a uniform. 
Please wear it, won't you?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
Right now?

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
Sure, throw it on and 
see how it fits.

## POINTER 32

Mmm, very nice! With a personality 
like yours and cute cat ears 
like that, you'll be a hit!

## POINTER 33
<STR>(RIT)
What do you mean I'll be a hit?!

## POINTER 34

A hit with the customers, of course. 
You look purrrrfect. I can't wait 
to see you working in that outfit!

## POINTER 35
<STR>(RIT)
A cat, eh...
Heh 
heh. Meow.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
Eh? Did you say something?

## POINTER 37
<STR>(RIT)
Who, meeee...ow?

## POINTER 38
<STR>(YUR)
Huh?

## POINTER 39
<STR>(RIT)
I, uh, didn't say anything...

## POINTER 40

You give off such 
a professional air 
when you work.

## POINTER 41
<STR>(JUD)
Oh really? I was 
just acting the way 
I normally do.

## POINTER 42
<STR>(YUR)
It must be because <STR>(JUD) 
is always so relaxed.

## POINTER 43

You're great. Really, 
just great. How'd you 
like to work here?

## POINTER 44
<STR>(JUD)
Sorry, I'll pass. 
I've got things 
I need to do.<PAGE>I don't mind helping every now and then, though.

## POINTER 45

Aw, rejected... Oh 
well, I thought you 
might say that.<PAGE>But since you said you don't mind 
helping on occasion, I'd like 
to give you this uniform.

## POINTER 46
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, thank you! 
I'll try it 
on right now.

## POINTER 47
<STR>(YUR)
You look good no matter 
what you wear, <STR>(JUD_P).

## POINTER 48

Wow, it looks great. Your 
body compliments the 
outfit quite nicely.

## POINTER 49
<STR>(JUD)
It's a little tight 
in the chest area...

## POINTER 50

It looks like your curves were 
even beyond what I imagined. 
I'm a little jealous...

## POINTER 51
<STR>(RAV)
Phew! That was some 
tough work!

## POINTER 52

Good job. You've helped 
me out quite a bit.

## POINTER 53
<STR>(RAV)
What else wouldja expect? I am 
the Great <STR>(RAV), after all.

## POINTER 54
<STR>(YUR)
That was the first time I've seen you 
do any serious work in a long time.

## POINTER 55
<STR>(RAV)
Whaddaya mean? I'm always 
serious about working!

## POINTER 56

Well, with as many customers as 
we get, there's not really any 
time to slack off, anyway.

## POINTER 57
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, he didn't have any 
time to goof off or flirt 
with any cute girls.

## POINTER 58
<STR>(RAV)
Phew, I'm beat!

## POINTER 59

Yes, thank you again. Please take 
this new uniform as a token of my 
appreciation for your hard work.

## POINTER 60
<STR>(RAV)
Eh? For me?

## POINTER 61

Yes. This is my best attempt at 
making a uniform for a male employee. 
It's sort of a trial model.

## POINTER 62
<STR>(RAV)
No, no, it looks great! And a 
present from a pretty lass, no 
less! I'll take it with pride!

## POINTER 63
<STR>(RAV)
Hey, hey! Not 
bad at all!

## POINTER 64

It looks great on you. 
It matches your hairstyle, 
too. A perfect fit!

## POINTER 65
<STR>(RAV)
What's this strange warmth? Love, 
perhaps? Wearing this, I can feel 
yer warm feelin's of affection...

## POINTER 66

You can feel the love?

## POINTER 67
<STR>(RAV)
Yeah, it's filled with 
it! This handiwork 
is second ta none!

## POINTER 68

Thank you. I'll 
tell my father that 
you like it.

## POINTER 69
<STR>(RAV)
......
Ah, er, 
yer father...made 
this...?

## POINTER 70
<STR>(YUR)
Tell him that 
we could feel 
the love.
