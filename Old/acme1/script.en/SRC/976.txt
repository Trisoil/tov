...The gear's stopped.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
...It looks like it's not 
moving because the gear's 
teeth are out of alignment.<PAGE>I think it might move if we 
put some energy into it.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Well, we needn't waste energy on moving strange gears.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
I see...So this is what's 
powering the aer supply...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
So if we can make this move, we'll 
be able to lower the ladder?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Hmmm... I'm not sure, 
but...it's possible.

Urgh... Urgh...Y-<STR>(YUR)...
Give me a hand here...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
This reminds me of what happened 
in the Shaikos Ruins!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
...In that case, it might 
not even move if I broke 
my back pushing on it...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
Now that you mention it, how 
about using that thingy?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
That thingy?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
Yeah, that thingy. Remember 
when it absorbed that aer?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
What thingy, <STR>(JUD)?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Oh yeah... The Sorcerer's Ring, right?
