<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_001)Do you think those knights 
followed you here?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_002)I wonder. Well, let's do our 
best not to stand out.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_003)Okay. And I want to 
catch up with <STR>(FRE) 
as soon as I can.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_004)All right, let's see if we can 
just pass through the Hold.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_005)Where's she off to now?

## POINTER 5

<VOICE>(VS05_006)Welcome. I've got some nice 
gear in stock today.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_007)This blade was forged by none other 
than Assam the blademaster. It even 
comes equipped with weapon skills.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_008)No traveler should be without them. 
Feel free to give it a try.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_009)Huh? What do you mean?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_010)The special techniques 
contained in weapons.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_011)These techniques were originally 
passed down from master to pupil...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_012)...but the blademaster Assam used 
a special process to seal them 
within the weapons themselves. <PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_013)Bodhi blastia can acquire techniques 
from weapons imbued with this power.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_014)With continued use, weapon artes 
can eventually be learned by the 
person using the weapon.

## POINTER 8

<VOICE>(VS05_015)My, this young lady knows her 
stuff. That about sums it up.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_016)I read in a book that the Kritya gave 
this knowledge to humans long ago.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_017)Huh. I thought bodhi blastia 
only let you use strike 
and magic artes.

## POINTER 11

<VOICE>(VS05_018)In order to find the fighting style 
that meets your needs...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_019)...it's best to think carefully 
about weapon skills when 
choosing your weapon.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_020)There are even weapons without weapon skills, 
that focus instead on raw attack power. 
It all depends on your preference.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_021)I can't imagine business is all 
that great in a place like this.

## POINTER 13

<VOICE>(VS05_022)Don't get me wrong, I'm not 
here because I want to be.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_023)There are monsters on the far side 
of the Hold, so I'm stuck.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_024)Monsters, huh...?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_025)...Did you hear that?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_026)Hmm...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_027)And...she's not listening.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_028)...Huh? Did you 
say something?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_029)I said I'm going to go get some information, 
so you wait right there.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_030)Oh, I'll come too.

## POINTER 21

<VOICE>(VS05_031)That's all right, go ahead and take it. 
It's pretty old and it has some pages 
missing, but it's yours if you like.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_032)Th-thank you very much.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_033)Is that book any good?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_034)It's fascinating. 
You can read it as 
soon as I finish.
