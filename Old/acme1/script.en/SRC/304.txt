Welcome. Staying the night?

<STR>(YUR)
I think a companion of ours should've already 
arrived. Did a cynical older man come in?

## POINTER 2

Oh, he's a friend of yours?<PAGE>Your rooms have already been paid for, 
so please, make yourselves at home.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Shall we call it a day?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Good idea. We've earned 
a good night's sleep.

## POINTER 5

Please don't hesitate to let me know when 
you'd like to turn in for the night.
