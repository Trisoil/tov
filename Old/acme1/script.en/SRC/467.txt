<VOICE>(VS48_001)...Oh, I'm so glad 
you are all safe!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_002)Huh.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_003)You did this, right? Had 
the inn open up its 
rooms free of charge.

## POINTER 2

<VOICE>(VS48_004)And just who are you? 
Watch your tongue. Do you 
know to whom you are--

## POINTER 3
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_005)There are many who have escaped with 
only the shirts on their backs.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_006)I felt this was one service their 
country could provide for them.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_007)Hmm, okay.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_008)Actually, I'm more 
interested in what you can 
tell me about the capital.

## POINTER 5
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_009)The capital... Zaphias is no
longer a city fit for any person.

## POINTER 6

<VOICE>(VS48_010)The city's barrier blastia began giving 
off a great light... And the town was 
wracked by earthquakes and lightning...

## POINTER 7
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_011)However, the real terror came after that.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_012)A glowing fog appeared from the barrier 
blastia, and quickly spread throughout  
the city.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_013)The plants it touched grew hideously 
large, and the water became poison... 
It was hell itself.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS48_014)The aer is out of control...

## POINTER 9

<VOICE>(VS48_015)Oh, that such dire events could 
befall Zaphias, jewel of our 
glorious empire...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS48_016)If the aer has covered 
the entire city... 
What is he doing to her...?

## POINTER 11

<VOICE>(VS48_017)Th-this is that turncoat 
Alexei's doing, I'm sure of it!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_018)He came to us demanding our 
obedience. When we refused, he 
swore he would reduce us to dust!

## POINTER 12

<VOICE>(VS48_019)That beast even had the gall 
to t-turn the Royal Guard on 
us after we made our escape!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS48_020)Then how did you come 
all this way unharmed?

## POINTER 14
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_021)<STR>(FRE) held them off for us. <PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_022)It is thanks to him that we 
refugees arrived here safely.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_023)If he hadn't come to our aid
just then, we all would've died.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_024)Oh, I'd love to hear more about 
how great <STR>(FRE) is, believe me...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_025)But I haven't seen anyone 
from the lower quarter here.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_026)What happened to them?

## POINTER 16
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_027)I'm sorry. I haven't 
seen anyone either.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS48_028)They must have been 
left behind. With all 
that aer flooding out.

## POINTER 18

<VOICE>(VS48_029)I-it was all we could do to save 
ourselves. With all that was happening we 
were unable to take everyone with us.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_030)We did all we could! 
You must understand!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_031)...Oh yeah?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS48_032)Hey...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_033)I'll be at the inn.
