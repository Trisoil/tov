I feel like the landscape 
here is a little strange...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes... Wasn't this area supposed 
to be a mountain range?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
It seems that the rumble we heard 
back in Dahngrest came from here.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
...Ya sayin' an entire mountain 
collapsed here? That's 
a pretty big cave in.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Deep beneath a steep and winding mountain 
range, on the sixth continent of Yurzorea, 
slumbers a man who transcends time...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? Wasn't that what was 
written in that book you 
got back in Yormgen...?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes.

## POINTER 7

Hmmm... It might have something to do
with this. Let's go down and have a look.
