You started 
all of this!

## POINTER 1

Huh? What are you talking about!

## POINTER 2
Regaey
B-both of you, s-stop 
this nonsense!<PAGE>M-making a scene like this out 
in f-front of everyone...

## POINTER 3

Mind your own business!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
You'd better put that away before you hurt yourself.

## POINTER 5

Who the hell are you!

## POINTER 6

Hey!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
If I'm wrong for doing this, you'll have 
my apology later. But I think it's you 
two who are in the wrong, here.

## POINTER 8

Damn it...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Are you okay?

## POINTER 10
Regaey
Oh, th-thank you 
so m-much!<PAGE>You were w-with 
M-madam President 
K-Kaufman...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
We're the guild, Brave Vesperia!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Come on, you're like a walking billboard!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
Heh heh, let him have his fun.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
You're Regaey of 
Ruins' Gate, right?<PAGE>You might want to work out a little before 
you go trying to stop any more fights.

## POINTER 15
Regaey
Oh, yes. I'm sorry. 
Th-thanks...

## POINTER 16
Regaey
Oh, umm, th-there's 
a f-favor I wanted 
to ask of you...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
Far be it for us to ignore 
a request from Ruins' Gate!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Well, it depends on what it is. 
What did you want to ask us?

## POINTER 19
Regaey
P-perhaps we could discuss this s-somewhere else...<PAGE>Could you come to the coliseum? 
W-we could talk about it there.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RAV)
Whatever he has to say, he doesn't want anyone else 
to overhear... Sounds pretty suspicious to me.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
If Ruins' Gate recognizes 
us, it'll help improve our 
reputation as a guild...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
Get too greedy with jobs and you'll 
end up neglecting all of them. 
Our job for the moment...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
...is to look for Phaeroh 
and to escort <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, you're right... I'll 
try to be more careful.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
But couldn't we at least hear what 
he has to say first, and then decide 
whether or not to accept?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, maybe you're right...

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RIT)
If he asks too much, we'll just say 
no. We don't have the time to be getting 
wrapped up in more craziness.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Let's go and stop by the 
coliseum, then. We can at 
least hear him out.
