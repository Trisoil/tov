Right here in the 
back of this box...<PAGE>Aha! "Urban Planning for Bustling Cities."

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
We've found what we're looking for, 
but there's nobody around at all.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
What should we do?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Excuse me! We'd like 
to borrow this book! 
That's okay, right?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
I don't hear any objections. 
Let's take the book and go.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
I don't know how anyone could 
hear such a quiet voice...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
All right, so you've finally 
gotten all of them?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Yep. I've collected 
all five.<PAGE>Now I can go and 
take that test.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Going out to look for books all across 
the world...what a crazy test!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
Oh, the real test has yet to begin.<PAGE>There'll be a written test that requires 
using these books as reference material.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Agh, just thinking about taking 
tests makes my head hurt.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
Wouldn't you like to give it a 
try? Just to see how you do.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, I wouldn't have a chance. I don't care 
about that what's-his-face degree anyway.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah, giving something like that to you would 
be like casting pearls before swine.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, who're you calling swine?!
