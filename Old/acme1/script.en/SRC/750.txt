......
...So that's about the 
long and the short of it.

## POINTER 1

Wow, things have gotten 
pretty bad.

## POINTER 2

Spirits, huh...

## POINTER 3

So you're saying you want 
to take our blastia research 
away from us?

## POINTER 4

People can't live 
without blastia!<PAGE>I don't like this idea one bit!

## POINTER 5

You all sure talk big for a bunch of amateurs with 
underfunded research that no one cares about.

## POINTER 6

What did you say?!

## POINTER 7

You wanna rumble?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
I didn't come here to 
listen to you have your 
petty arguments!<PAGE>Can you just put your emotions on hold for a few minutes?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
Anyway, it's as I told you.<PAGE>We mages will soon be unable 
to simply continue with 
our studies of blastia.<PAGE>I just thought it would be 
best if I let you know.

## POINTER 10

We can't accept 
what you've 
told us.

## POINTER 11

Even if you're the best brain 
in Aspio, you're still a child.

## POINTER 12

Adults are reluctant to pay heed to 
the words of one so young as you.<PAGE>Surely that's all it is.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
That's really...not the issue here.

## POINTER 14

Adults have their own way of discussing 
things. You just leave everything to us.

## POINTER 15

Right. We'll do something 
about that stubborn bunch!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
Sorry about that. 
Come on, let's go.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
Is it really okay to leave 
so soon? I mean...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
It's fine. Let's go.
