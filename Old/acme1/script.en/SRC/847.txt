I'm sorry, <STR>(YUR). I thought 
he might find out.

did what you could. It was just 
our turn to do the same.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
You got that line from 
<STR>(YUR), didn't you?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(FRE)
<STR>(YUR), take this as 
a token of my thanks, 
would you?

## POINTER 22

want it.

<STR>(JUD)
Come on, why not?<PAGE>Presents are what's formed 
when someone's pure 
emotions take shape.

## POINTER 24

She's right, kid.
Just take it.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(FRE)
I'm not sure if it'll come in handy or 
not, but please, use it if you'd like.

<STR>(EST_P)
It'll definitely come in handy. 
Isn't that right, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
Mmm, yeah, it will. 
I'll be sure to put 
it to good use.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
Good job accepting something
graciously for a change, <STR>(YUR)!
