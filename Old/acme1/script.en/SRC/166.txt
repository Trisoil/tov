Come on, let's take it back with us!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
It's covered in scars and bruises... 
I feel kind of sorry for it.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
I reckon it's been attacked by desperate 
townspeople quite a few times.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
It's not the people in town's fault!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
No, I understand.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)...?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
The horn is what's so valuable, right? 
This'll be enough to satisfy that 
money-grubbing magistrate.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Wow, it's not like you to 
show pity to a monster.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
While you guys are busy talking, 
the monster's getting up!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Wh-what? Why did it run away?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
It understood what 
we were thinking!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
The monster did? Seriously?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, we got the horn. 
Who cares either way?
