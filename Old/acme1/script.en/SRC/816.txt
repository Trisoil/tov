Wonder Chef
Cooking is in the heart. Do not get
too caught up in physical results.

## POINTER 1
Wonder Chef
I have nothing left to teach you.<PAGE>Let us meet again once you have reached 
the next step in your path to culinary perfection.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Sounds good to me.

## POINTER 3
Wonder Chef
It's essential to follow a recipe,
but it's even more important to
experiment with new possibilities.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Y-yes, I understand.

## POINTER 5
Wonder Chef
Your sense of taste is still very 
underdeveloped. As you grow, you'll
find that your culinary skills will follow suit.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Th-that's easy for you to say...

## POINTER 7
Wonder Chef
You...already know what I'm going to tell you, don't you?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
What do you mean?

## POINTER 9
Wonder Chef
Without a proper love of cooking, you will never 
master the path of culinary perfection!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Meh, who cares? It's all the same mush 
once it hits your stomach, anyway.

## POINTER 11
Wonder Chef
Bl-blasphemy...

## POINTER 12
Wonder Chef
Your style is tough and rugged, like yourself. But 
the path to culinary perfection is not an easy one. 
You still have much hard work ahead of you.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
This culinary perfection stuff bores me...

## POINTER 14
Wonder Chef
Such amazing skill... At 
long last, the next Wonder 
Chef has been born...<PAGE>Here, you may take this knife.
May it serve you well.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
No thanks, I'll pass.<PAGE>Can you imagine hiding in a cacti patch 
or a ice cream cone until someone
came and found me? Hah hah!

## POINTER 16
Wonder Chef
Urgh...

## POINTER 17
Wonder Chef
As I was saying..! The perfect dish is the
result of the exchange of harsh critiques.
Only then, can perfection be achieved!<PAGE>In other words, cooking is not based on
the effort of one, but the result of many.
For that, I shall grant you all titles!

## POINTER 18
Wonder Chef
At any rate, it was a fine tournament.
I look forward to the day we meet again!<PAGE>Farewell!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Sorry we kept you waiting, <STR>(RAP).

## POINTER 20

Woof woof!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
That cooking battle was a lot of fun!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. And <STR>(FRE)'s cooking 
was...remarkable.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah, and it looked so 
delicious, too... What 
a terrible surprise...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
Now you know how I feel! To think,
he wanted me to be personal taster!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(JUD)
Good thing you're a good cook, <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
Yeah, ya can say that again!

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
Well then, should we get going?
