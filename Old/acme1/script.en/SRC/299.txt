<VOICE>(VS26_113)Of all the... Why do I 
always get sucked 
into these messes?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS26_114)If it was anybody other 
than me, you guys 
would've been left behind.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)

do it again, promise.

<VOICE>(VS26_116)*Sigh*

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS26_117)I wonder what caused the ceres 
blastia to break down?

## POINTER 6
Tokunaga
<VOICE>(VS26_118)Who knows? It just came 
back to life suddenly...

<VOICE>(VS26_120)Perhaps the captain wanted to 
pass the clear ciel crystal on to 
someone, and reached out to us.

Sounds like a curse to me.

so it just can't!

no one was hurt.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS26_126)Well, the boss here's 
seen better days.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS26_127)Hey, are we going to

to finally getting there 
as well.
