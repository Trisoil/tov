Oh, what a pleasant surprise. I was 
hoping I'd see you again soon.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Oh yeah? What ridiculous price are 
you going to charge us this time?

## POINTER 2

Please, good visitors, don't be 
so harsh! After all of the kind 
service I've given you...<PAGE>But actually, there's a favor I'd 
like to ask of you, if you wouldn't 
mind. Might you hear me out?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
I assume yer willin' ta give 
us somethin' in return?

## POINTER 4

Of course, of course! I would be more than 
willing to compensate you for your help.<PAGE>Perhaps a free lifetime 
pass to our hot springs 
would do the trick?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
You mean we could go in any 
time we wanted for free?

## POINTER 6

Yes, yes, of course. 
You could come and 
go as you pleased.

<STR>(RIT)
A resort where spa rental costs 600,000 Gald...is 
going to give us lifetime admission 
for free? Who do you want us to kill?

## POINTER 8

No, no, it's not that... It's just...there's 
a group of customers coming in 
soon, and I'm short on help.<PAGE>If you could just give me your help 
with some tasks around the resort, 
I'd appreciate it tremendously.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Let's help! It sounds like it would 
be really tough for him otherwise.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Oh well. There's no
dissuading the Princess
once she gets like this.

## POINTER 11

Excellent, excellent! You'll find everything 
you need in the staff room. Please go and change 
into the appropriate employee uniform.
