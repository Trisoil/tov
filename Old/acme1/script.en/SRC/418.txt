<VOICE>(VS39_014)It's them!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_015)Get out of our way!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_016)Now, then. At least we 
don't have to worry about 
being shot at anymore.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_017)We might have stopped 
the Knights, but we've still 
got to deal with this guy.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_018)Hmm... He's not a Hermes 
blastia, but the formula's 
been encrypted...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_019)Care to explain in English?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_020)Basically, without a key 
to decode the formula, 
we can't turn it off.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_021)So I assume breaking 
the code isn't...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_022)...No, it's not easy. 
Even if I could break it, 
that would take time.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_023)Hmm... Maybe if I...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS39_024)I don't think this will 
take much time at all.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_025)Wait... But 
you said...!

## POINTER 11

<VOICE>(VS39_026)Heeelp...!!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_027)What are you 
doing here...?!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS39_028)Perhaps he is this 
blastia's engineer.

## POINTER 14

<VOICE>(VS39_029)N-no! I mean, I am an 
engineer, and all, but I...I 
was just following orders.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_030)I...I swear I never wanted to get 
involved in something like this...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_031)Undo the code and 
stop this blastia, now!

## POINTER 16

<VOICE>(VS39_032)Y-yes, of course, 
right away...!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS39_033)I'm sorry for surprising 
you back there.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_034)Humph... Duh. I knew right 
away you were only trying 
to make me jump.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS39_035)Oh...?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS39_036)At least that's one problem down. Now we
can go to Myorzo, once the weather clears.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_037)No!!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS39_038)What is it...?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS39_039)Aaah...!!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS39_040)Y-Y-<STR>(YUR)...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_041)I could use your 
help here, kid.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS39_042)A-ah, right...!

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_043)Should've known they'd 
have another one of these.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS39_044)<STR>(YUR)...don't tell me you 
did that to keep me 
from using my power...!

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_045)Don't you think that 
was a bit reckless?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS39_046)Indeed...do you have 
a death wish?

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_047)...This? This is nothing.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS39_048)<STR>(YUR), Iâ€™m sorry... 
It was my fault...

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_049)Hey, you did the same 
for us before, right? 
Now we're even.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS39_050)But...

## POINTER 35
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS39_051)<STR>(EST_P), perhaps a 
simple "thank you" 
would do best.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS39_052)I... Th-thank you.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_053)Moving right along... 
We'd better do something 
about that other blastia.

## POINTER 38
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_054)Hey, you wouldn't 
happen to know...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_055)Hey!

## POINTER 39
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS39_056)He's gone! That 
engineer got away!

## POINTER 40
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_057)Fast little bugger... We'd 
better catch him quick.

## POINTER 41
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_058)Wait.

## POINTER 42
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_059)I'll just have to do it again.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_060)They'll find us with the hoplon 
blastia sooner or later if we just 
go tramping through the woods.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_061)And if that happens, somebody 
might get it in their fool head 
to go and play hero again.

## POINTER 43
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS39_062)Y-yeah...but you said it wasn't easy...

## POINTER 44
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_063)As long as the Knights aren't 
around, we don't have to worry 
so much about how long it takes.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_064)Besides, who do you think 
you're dealing with? I'm the 
genius mage, <STR>(RIT) Mordio.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_065)If it's me versus a blastia, 
I'll win or die trying.

## POINTER 45
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS39_066)...Let's hope it doesn't 
come to that...

## POINTER 46
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS39_067)What are you doing?

## POINTER 47
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_068)If we leave it like this, someone 
could use it again. I'll just make 
a few adjustments.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_069)...I'm sorry.

## POINTER 48
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_070)Ahh, nothin' shines quite so bright 
as a young person with somethin' 
they're willin ta risk their life for.

## POINTER 49
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_071)For somebody who's stood on death's 
doorstep, saying you'll do something or 
die trying isn't just a figure of speech.

## POINTER 50
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_072)Huh? Death's doorstep?

## POINTER 51
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_073)Didn't you say you almost 
died during the Great War?

## POINTER 52
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_074)Ah, forgot I mentioned that.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_075)...Well... Only the livin' have 
the privilege of sayin' they'll 
fight ta the last breath.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_076)And words like conviction 
and resolve don't mean 
much to a dead man...

## POINTER 53
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_077)You okay, old man?

## POINTER 54
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_078)Here I am, runnin' off at the 
mouth. I get a bit sentimental 
when I start diggin' up the past.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_079)Come on. Onward!
