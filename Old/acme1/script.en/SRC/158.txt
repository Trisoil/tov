<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_042)...Heh, that was about to get ugly...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_043)All right...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_044)Whoa, hold on! 
What are you doing?!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_045)<STR>(YUR), I'm happy to see you're 
finally seeing the world 
outside the barrier.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_046)So, be a little more happy then.
And stop pointing that thing at me.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_047)Well I got a little less 
happy when I saw this!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_048)Hey, it's up to 10,000 Gald. 
Nice.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_049)I didn't think when you quit the Knights 
that you'd take up a life of crime.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_050)A lot of things have happened, <STR>(FRE). 
It's not that simple.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_051)Simple or not, a 
crime is a crime.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_052)...Good to see you're as stubborn 
as always. I... uh-oh.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS15_053)<STR>(YUR), I heard something 
happened. Are you all...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_054)Perfect timing.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS15_055)...<STR>(FRE)!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_056)Huh...?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS15_057)Oh, <STR>(FRE). 
Are you all right? 
Have you been hurt?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_058)...I-I'm fine. 
Um, Lady <STR>(EST)...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS15_059)Oh! I'm sorry. I was just 
so happy to see you, I...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_060)...Please, this way.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS15_061)What? Ah, but... <STR>(FRE), there's 
something I need to tell you...!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_062)...I'd better go find 
<STR>(KAR) and <STR>(RIT).
