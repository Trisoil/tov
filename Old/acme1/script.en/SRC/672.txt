Do you mind if we take 
the room next door?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
It might be a bit small, 
but go right ahead.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, wait for me!

## POINTER 3
Ted
Welcome back, <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
You're full of energy as usual, Ted.

## POINTER 5
Ted
Eh? <STR>(FRE)'s 
not with you?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
He's been busy with the Knights. I 
couldn't drag around some rising 
star captain on my little errands.

## POINTER 7
Ted
...Did you two get in a fight again?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Again? Do <STR>(FRE) and 
<STR>(YUR) fight a lot?

## POINTER 9
Ted
Yup, day in and day out. <STR>(YUR), I want 
you to go and make up with <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Look, it's not that simple.

## POINTER 11
Ted
Simple? You and <STR>(FRE) are 
as simple as they come!<PAGE>Like when we couldn't pay our 
taxes. You thought you'd just 
get rid of the tax collector.<PAGE>What's simple is your way of thinking. 
Even I would've thought that 
one through a little more.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
That's simple, all right.

## POINTER 13
Ted
They're both too stubborn. If they'd 
just give each other an inch...<PAGE>Like when <STR>(YUR) quit the Imperial 
Knights...things keep getting 
rocky like that.

## POINTER 14
Ted
You two are incorrigible. 
Here, take this and go patch 
things up with <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
Bread? Why?

## POINTER 16
Ted
You can split it. <STR>(YUR) and <STR>(FRE) 
have split everything with each 
other, ever since they were kids.<PAGE>Like their first sword. They could 
only afford one, so they switched 
off using it all day long.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
Ah, I think I'm starting 
to see how similar <STR>(YUR) 
and <STR>(FRE) really are.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
We've been together forever. When 
you grow up in the same environment, 
you're bound to be a little alike.

## POINTER 19
Ted
You'd better make up with him before 
the next time you come back here.<PAGE>Then I'll have the missus cook 
up everyone a nice, big dinner!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
Make up with <STR>(FRE), huh...<PAGE>It was so easy when we were kids...
