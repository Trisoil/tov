I see, so you ran away 
to Halure after what 
happened in Aspio.

## POINTER 1
Giovanni
Yes. It's just not possible 
to live there anymore, with 
things as they are.<PAGE>Now then, if you'd be so 
kind, I'd like to borrow your 
Collector's Book now.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, go right ahead.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
I don't mind... But you'll 
have to give it back to 
us by tomorrow morning.

## POINTER 4
Giovanni
Of course, of course... Wait, what?!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
That's how it has to be. We're 
running on a very tight schedule.<PAGE>We can't stay around here 
indefinitely while we wait for 
you to finish with our book.

## POINTER 6
Giovanni
Oh... I see. Yes, I don't want 
to cause you any inconvenience.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
We're sorry...

## POINTER 8
Giovanni
No, don't worry about it.<PAGE>Then I'll borrow 
it for the night.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
Keep it safe!

## POINTER 10
Giovanni
Of course!

## POINTER 11
Giovanni
I've reserved the room next 
door as well. You may feel free 
to sleep there tonight.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Ah, how thoughtful of you.

## POINTER 13
Giovanni
No, it would be rude not to 
offer. Well then, I'd better 
get started right away!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, what do you think he's going to 
do with that book in a single night?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Oh, Giovanni's known among researchers 
for his fast writing skills. He's probably 
going to make a copy of the book.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Really...? There's no 
way he could do that...

## POINTER 17
Giovanni
Here you go. Thank 
you very much.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Y-you actually managed to 
copy it in a single night...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
Hah! I told you so! But Giovanni, 
I'm impressed. It looks like you're 
still as persistent as ever.

## POINTER 20
Giovanni
Well, I'll admit, this time 
was particularly tough.<PAGE>Ah yes, before I forget. 
Take this as a token 
of my thanks.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
O-oh! Really?

## POINTER 22
Giovanni
The data that you've given 
me is far more valuable. This 
is the least I can do.<PAGE>I must show my respect 
for elite item maniacs 
like yourselves...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
Item maniacs? What 
do you mean...?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
...I guess he just 
means that we know 
a lot about items.<PAGE>Well then, we'll 

be going...
......?

## POINTER 25
Giovanni
...*snore*

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
He fell asleep standing up...
