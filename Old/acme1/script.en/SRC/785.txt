Meooow!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Oh, a cat...
...Meow!

## POINTER 2

(Are you the one they call the Dog Warrior?)

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAP)
(I've been called that name. Can I help you with something?)

## POINTER 4

(A vicious dog showed up in town 
recently, and he's been causing 
us no end of trouble!)<PAGE>(He's causing trouble for all of the dogs 
and cats in town, and the humans, too. 
Could you please get rid of him?)

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAP)
(I don't usually do mercenary work, but...)

## POINTER 6

(Hey there, 
pussycat. âˆ€)

## POINTER 7

(...That's him!)

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAP)
(It's you...!)

## POINTER 9

(Oh, lookie what the 
cat dragged in!)

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAP)
(Stand back, ma'am.)

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAP)
(I hear you've been trotting around town like you 
own the place. Causing trouble for the locals.)

## POINTER 12

(Oh, the things some people say. 
I'm just trying to free this city 
from the self-serving humans.)

## POINTER 13

(In our city, humans and animals 
live together in peace! You should 
mind your own business!)

## POINTER 14

(Sucking up to the humans, 
eh? How pitiful.)

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAP)
(Sucking up to someone and getting along 
with them aren't the same thing.)<PAGE>(But it looks like you never learned 
the difference, Old Man.)

## POINTER 16

(As always, you don't know 
when to keep your mouth shut. 
How about I shut it for you...for 
good?)

## POINTER 17

(Damn it... How did you beat 
me so easily... I'll show you...!)

## POINTER 18

(...Th-thank you...)<PAGE>(As our way of showing our thanks, this town's 
dogs and cats will work together to make sure 
your territory around here stays protected.)

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAP)
(Oh... That'd be real 
nice of you.)

## POINTER 20

(It's the least we can do for you, after 
you made that terrible dog go away.)

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
So maybe that means all 
of <STR>(RAP)'s territory around 
this city is safe?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I think so. Isn't 
that great, <STR>(RAP)?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
I'm sure this town's cats don't want it to belong 
to the likes of the Little Wolf, either.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
You know, I have to say... I didn't 
know all of you were so fluent 
in the canine language!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(JUD)
Heh heh. That would certainly be 
a sight to see if it were true.
