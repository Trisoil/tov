Is this the shovel?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
It looks like "Harmfall" 
is written on it.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
...But no sign of 
Markham's name.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
So it isn't this one, then.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Shall we keep looking?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
If it is here, shouldn't 
it be somewhere nearby?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Wonder if we missed it somehow...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
There's no worry of that. It 
wouldn't get past my eyes.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Then somebody must have 
walked off with it.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Who'd just randomly pick up a shovel 
with them when they left?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
How should I know?
I'm sure there're shovel fanatics out there.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Sort of like how you're a blastia fanatic...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
I am not a fanatic.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
...Wonder if this means we'll fail this job.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
But the item we were sent to get isn't even 
here. That's different than failing.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
Your client may beg ta 
differ with ya on that 
little point, though.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Man...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
Well, what about this one?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
There'd be no point dragging 
it around. Let's just 
leave it here.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
You might just be making the 
next shovel fanatic that 
comes along very happy.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
And you'd know just how 
they'd feel, right <STR>(RIT)?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
You should know you're gonna get chopped by now...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
I... I think maybe...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Huh...?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
Anyone who's forgotten a shovel in a 
place like this has to have something 
to do with the excavation, right?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
Well...yeah, that's 
probably true, but...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(EST_P)
Why don't we drop it off with 
the client and let them decide 
what to do with it?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
Hmm... Maybe this "Harmfall" 
is someone those 
two guys know.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Doesn't exactly lighten our load, 
but I guess we can take it to them.
