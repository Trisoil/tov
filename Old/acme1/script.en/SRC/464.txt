...There sure are a lot of people here.

They're refugees from the capital. 
See how they're all well-dressed?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
It looks like there's nothing unusual 
with the barrier here for now.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
*Huff* *huff*

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
<STR>(KAR), are you okay?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Looks like he ain't okay at all.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
He's got a bad fever. He really overexerted himself.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
All because he had to go 
and be a hero! I swear...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(YUR)...?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? Oh, sorry. Let's 
go to the inn so that 
<STR>(KAR) can rest.
