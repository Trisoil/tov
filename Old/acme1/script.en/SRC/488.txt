<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS50_148)Going already?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS50_149)It looks like things here 
won't be settled for a while.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_150)I had hopes that we'd have 
the guild ships at our disposal.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_151)I heard they've been 
having some issues.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS50_152)It seems they've been unable 
to decide on a course of 
action since the Don's passing.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_153)It looks like I'll be one step 
behind you again this time.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_154)No hard feelings, no 
matter which of us gets 
to Alexei first, right?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_155)Oh yeah. Are you done 
trying to get <STR>(EST_P) back?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_156)I mean, she's still a princess. 
And what about all that stuff 
with the imperial succession?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS50_157)The Council has chosen 
Ioder as their leader.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_158)For all intents and purposes 
he's got their nomination 
for the throne.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_159)Hm. Okay.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_160)So that's why you don't need 
to chase her around anymore?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS50_161)That's not it.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_162)It's just that I've finally come 
to terms with the choices 
she's made for herself.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_163)Wow. You sure loosened up.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS50_164)Don't give me a hard time. 
It's something I've had to 
struggle with in my own way.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_165)Well, she'd be happy 
to hear it.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS50_166)I'll bring the problems of 
the aer and the blastia to 
His Highness' attention.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_167)He'll be able to come up with 
some way of helping, I'm sure.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_168)As for Lady <STR>(EST)... <STR>(YUR), 
you have my confidence.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS50_169)I appreciate it. Sorry 
for being such a pain.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_170)Well, I'm gonna get going. 
See you at Zaude.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS50_171)...As far as anyone is concerned, the 
capital was retaken because of my 
efforts. It isn't just with this, though.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_172)No one knows the things you...
that Brave Vesperia have done 
for them. They probably never will.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS50_173)Are you satisfied with that?
