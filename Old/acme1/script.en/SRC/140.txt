Looks like this little one is no good...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Wow, so this is what blastia look 
like before they're excavated.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
I wonder why ancient people buried blastia 
in ruins like this in the first place?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
I wish I could tell you. That's 
something else being researched.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
With all of these blastia here, I don't suppose 
there are any aque blastia lying around too...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
None of them have cores in them.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Really? Then they don't 
work, do they?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Blastia aren't excavated with the 
cores and the bodies together.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
"Cores produce magic through formulas. 
Bodies control that magic. The two 
combined are referred to as blastia."<PAGE>"Each blastia possesses 
different attributes, and is
marked by a crest that 
indicates those attributes."<PAGE>"With current technology, 
blastia bodies can be 
manufactured, but the production
of blastia cores is impossible."

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
So basically, cores are very valuable, since 
they have to be excavated. It's only natural 
that thieves would want to steal them.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
That's not quite true. It 
seems <STR>(EST_P)'s information
is a little outdated.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
What's outdated about it?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
There's some degradation of quality, 
but there's been some success in 
the synthesis of simple blastia cores.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Really?!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
That's why I wouldn't do anything stupid 
like go stealing people's cores!<PAGE>If I had time to waste doing things like that, I'd 
rather be spending it researching better ways to 
completely restore incomplete or degraded cores.<PAGE>That's what being a 
mage is all about!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
A noble creed. But that 
doesn't clear your name.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
...Yes, talk is
cheap, I suppose.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
P-perhaps there are still some 
blastia left that can be used!
