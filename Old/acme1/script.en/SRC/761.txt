Having a travel permit is 
Fortune's Market's right, 
as it is our responsibility.<PAGE>Since you sealed off the roads, 
I guess you're okay with our cargo 
shipments not going to the capital?

## POINTER 1

That's not what I'm saying!

## POINTER 2
Kaufman
It's just like Nordopolica. What gives the 
Knights--protectors of the people--the 
right to oppress them?

## POINTER 3

The Imperial Knights don't 
need your permission to 
do what needs to be done.<PAGE>I can see we're not going to reach 
an agreement like this. Now, if 
you would please let me pass?

## POINTER 4
Kaufman
Wait...!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Sadly, what that official 
said is right.

## POINTER 6
Kaufman
<STR>(YUR) Lowell? And 
you, aren't you 
with Altosk...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
What a happy surprise 
ta be remembered 
by such a lovely lady.

## POINTER 8
Kaufman
Perhaps Altosk is planning on 
sticking its nose into the business 
of Fortune's Market?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Nah, I just came ta ask 
fer yer cooperation. 
As a member of the Union.

## POINTER 10
Kaufman
Our cooperation?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
Help us make the Union
as strong as it useta be. <PAGE>Fortune's Market is one of the 
pillars of the Union. Or aren't ya?<PAGE>I'm sure ya know how important 
the Union is fer the guilds.<PAGE>We'll all just get trampled 
on if we don't work 
together against them.

## POINTER 12
Kaufman
...This, from someone who's been 
parading all over the world with 
<STR>(YUR) for the past how many weeks?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
Altosk has already mobilized. 
That's why I'm out here 
gatherin' information.

## POINTER 14
Kaufman
I hear you've been traveling as 
the Don's right-hand man, and 
watching the Imperial Knights.<PAGE>All right, let's do it. We'll save face 
for you and the Don and promote 
the rebuilding of the Union.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
I'm glad you're as 
decisive as they say.

## POINTER 16
Kaufman
It is an honor to be recognized as 
such by someone so well-versed in 
negotiations with the Empire.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
Please, ya flatter me. I've just 
lived long enough ta get a little 
clever about these things.

## POINTER 18
Kaufman
I hope that I can do the same. 
Now, if you'll excuse me.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(RAV), I'm impressed at how 
well you dealt with an imposing 
lady like Miss Kaufman!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RAV)
Compared to the Don, 
she was nothin'.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah. The Don was 
more...impressive.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RAV)
Don't just agree with me! 
Where's the "But <STR>(RAV), 
you were awesome!"

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? B-but...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
Come on, let's go.
