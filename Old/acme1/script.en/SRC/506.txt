The atmosphere is kind of strange.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah... The Union is
falling apart...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
Cause nobody wants to step 
in ta take the Don's place.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
And the Don's heir ain't quite up to 
it. Come on, don't hang back, now.

## POINTER 4
Harry
I was the one who led 
Grandpa to his death.<PAGE>Someone like me could never become 
a man like the Don was.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Nobody's sayin' ya gotta become 
a man like the Don was.<PAGE>We're just saying you should 
at least show up to the 
succession meetings.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, do you have the Don's 
apatheia? We'd appreciate 
if you could give it to us.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Wow, that was quite 
a fastball, <STR>(RIT)...

## POINTER 8
Harry
...That apatheia belongs to 
whoever succeeds the Don. 
It's not given to outsiders.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
What? Well, when will they 
choose a successor?

## POINTER 10
Harry
I don't know. 
Don't ask me.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
That boy's a real piece of work.<PAGE>Who's going to protect the city
if the Union isn't.

## POINTER 12

What? That would be 
our guild, of course!

## POINTER 13

Talking of who's guild?<PAGE>I know that you sent 
in your Clouds of Dawn 
members to Zaude

## POINTER 14

The Union has never been outstripped 
by the empire. We cannot sit here 
and risk falling behind!

## POINTER 15

I say it was imprudent. It could 
have been taken as the Union's
hostile act against the Empire.

## POINTER 16

In that case, we would defend 
our honor on the battlefield.

## POINTER 17

And who will be leading the battle?
The Clouds of Dawn?<PAGE>If the Don got wind of that 
he'd burst out laughing.

## POINTER 18

So why don't you boys in Altosk 
throw your hat into the ring?<PAGE>Maybe then we'd see just how 
unpopular you really are!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
This is ridiculous. Continue 
as you please till the 
world comes to an end.<PAGE>But don't bring up a 
war between the guilds. 
This isn't a joke.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
It's all right to be helped by 
your friends. Protect your friends 
and they'll respond in kind.<PAGE>That was the last thing 
that the Don said to me.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 22

What? Who's this kid?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
I can't do anything by myself, 
but I have my friends!<PAGE>Because my friends are there 
for me, I can do anything!<PAGE>They're still there for me, even now.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
Why isn't that good enough 
for the Union?!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RAV)
The boy is right. The best thing 
that the guilds ever had was their 
ability to help each other.<PAGE>There is always a way to deal 
with things even if ya aren't 
some great big leader.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
The Don told you that from 
now on, you have to walk 
with your own feet.<PAGE>You know how to walk on 
your own feet, don't you?

## POINTER 27

...

## POINTER 28

You make it sound so 
easy, but actually--

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
Let's go. I'm gonna get sick if 
I have to stay here any longer.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, you, wait up!

## POINTER 31
Harry
