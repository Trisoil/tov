Where'd this manual 
wind up, anyway...?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
I wonder if Cumore didn't 
just pocket it for himself.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
If he did, we'd find it at his 
place in the royal quarter.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
A little light burglary, huh?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
No, we should ask someone at 
the house to go and see if 
they can find it for us.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
We might as well go check the 
place out... You know where 
Cumore's pad is, old man?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
It's in the east end of the royal quarter 
back at the capital, if memory serves.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
That's right. Cumore's from a pretty 
well to do noble family, isn't he?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Royal quarter, huh...? Wonder if they'll 
be so kind as to let us in.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Don't worry. I'll see that 
we're allowed to enter.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
That should make things go a little smoother.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
All right, come on, let's go!
