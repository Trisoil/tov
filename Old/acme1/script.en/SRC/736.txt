You did this one too, 
didn't you, <STR>(JUD_P)?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
Yep, that's right.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Hey <STR>(JUD)...the reason you were destroying 
the hermes blastia was because they 
were a danger to the planet, right?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
That's right.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
So in other words, you did it 
to save the world from harm?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
I don't mind if you 
think of it that way.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
...Something about that just 
doesn't make sense to me.<PAGE>Why not just take down that Hermes 
guy who was making the blastia?<PAGE>Either that, or tell a mage 
about it, or something...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
...I was putting my life on the line to put 
a stop to rogue blastia that were causing 
strange effects on the world's aer...<PAGE>No one would believe a 
crazy story like that.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
! If you had only told me...!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
You think you could have done something about 
all of the hermes blastia in the world, when 
you don't even know how many there are?<PAGE>I'm sure that you may have been 
able to stop one or two of 
them, with enough trying.<PAGE>But you would surely die before you had 
managed to take care of all of them.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
......

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Since you were with Ba'ul, there was something you 
could do about the blastia going out of control.<PAGE>Is that what you mean, <STR>(JUD_P)?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
I don't have any way of making adjustments to 
the blastia, so destroying it was the only way 
I could make sure it wouldn't be a problem.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
But...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
You think we might be able to go by Aspio 
the next time we get some free time?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Why bring that up all of the sudden?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
It's about the hermes blastia. 
There's something I'd like 
to investigate a bit.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
...But you see...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, you'd like to go back 
home, wouldn't you, <STR>(RIT)?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
Not particularly...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
All right, let's stop by there 
when we have some time.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
The city of Aspio's pretty 
much gone now, isn't it?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
Why bring that up all of the sudden?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(JUD)
There were several things 
I wanted to investigate regarding 
the hermes blastia.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
...Most of the city's books and other 
resources were probably taken out 
of the city by the refugee mages.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
So then, if we find the mages that 
fled from Aspio, <STR>(JUD_P) might be able 
to investigate what she wants to.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
Right.
