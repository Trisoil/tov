<STR>(RIT)
Come to think of it, 
I forgot to ask.<PAGE>You said you were looking 
for a book. Why?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, did I 
say that?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
You can stop playing dumb, <STR>(JUD). I'm 
not going to fall for it anymore.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
...He's my dad.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Huh? Who is?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
Hermes.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
...Huh...?<PAGE>What...?!<PAGE>What the...? I mean, how... But you...? 
And you broke all those blastia...?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
I destroyed the blastia precisely because 
it was my dad who'd made them.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
W-why didn't you tell me that sooner? Don't 
you think that's important to know?!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
I don't really think the connection between Hermes 
and myself is that important, myself...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
...*Sigh*... You don't seem to 
realize the importance of sharing 
any of your knowledge...<PAGE>So? You were destroying the blastia your father 
had made...to atone for his mistakes?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
No, I'm hardly that noble. I 
was just trying to clean up his 
mess before anyone noticed.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
What do you mean...? So, you weren't 
doing it for the planet...you 
were doing it for your father?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
Yes...I guess so.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
I can't understand how you could 
feel that sort of sympathy. 
I don't have a father, so...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
You don't remember your father?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
He left right after I was 
born. There's no way 
I could remember him.<PAGE>I hardly even remember what my 
own mother's face looked like.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
...I see.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
What's that...?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
It's a keepsake of my dad. A thermo blastia, 
used to measure the temperature.<PAGE>He created some things that 
weren't harmful, too...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Hermes must have been really 
amazing... To create new blastia 
so easily like that...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
You can have it.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
What do you mean? Isn't it 
a memento of your father?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(JUD)
That's why I'm giving it to you.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
That's why you're...what?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(JUD)
...I think you'd be a better person 
to have it than I would. I don't 
know much about blastia, anyway.<PAGE>Don't you think it's better for the 
blastia if you're holding onto it?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
Wait, but why should I...?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
You should keep the blastia. Think 
of it as...for its own good.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RIT)
B-but...

## POINTER 29
<STR>(JUD)
All right, how about we call it a night?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
Ah...

## POINTER 31
<STR>(JUD)
Good night!

## POINTER 32
<STR>(RIT)
......
Good 
night...

## POINTER 33
<STR>(JUD)
...Feel free to give it a name, if you'd like.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(RIT)
But... I mean...<PAGE>All right then, Juana it is...

## POINTER 35
<STR>(JUD)
Tee hee... That's a cute 
name... I'm sure she's 
quite happy with it.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(RIT)
...Juana...
