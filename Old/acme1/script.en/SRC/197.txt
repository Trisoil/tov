<STR>(RIT)
Hey, I thought 
you went to
see <STR>(EST)?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
She seems to be 
asleep already.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
She must have been 
exhausted today. 
I didn't want to wake her up.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
We can still 
talk tomorrow.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Right. Why don't we all 
return to our rooms then.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAP)
...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
What's the matter, <STR>(RAP)?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Do you guys hear a strange sound?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Now that you mention it, yeah...

## POINTER 9

Oh, I've been hearing that 
the barrier blastia's been 
acting up lately...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, hold your horses!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
I can't!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Commandant Alexei is there, isn't he? 
He should be able to take care of it.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(RIT), if we let you go out on 
your own, it'll just be another 
repeat of Ehmead Hill.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Well, if you want, we could at 
least let <STR>(FRE) know about it.
