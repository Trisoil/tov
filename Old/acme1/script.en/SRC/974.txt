...Ah, so this is what they were 
keeping in the lower levels.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
What is all this?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
That blastia network that Alexei was 
trying to create... This is all equipment 
that was to be used for that.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
This is...?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Yes. It seems that he had Barbos 
set up Ghasfarost as one of 
the nodes in the network.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
So Alexei was behind what 
Barbos was doing, after all.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
With Zaude at the center of the network, 
and other nodes at Ghasfarost, the capital, 
Capua, Halure, Heliord, and Aspio...<PAGE>This network siphoned aer from 
blastia all over the world to Zaude, 
giving him all that power.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Aer should be used so people can 
live happily, but he wanted to use 
it for his own personal gain...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
And that's what caused this 
teensy little global catastrophe 
we're dealin' with.<PAGE>I can't forgive what he did, 
but I can't help feelin' 
a little sorry fer him.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
There's no need to 
feel sorry for him.<PAGE>It's because of Alexei's evil 
deeds that our world is in 
such trouble right now.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
There's no use arguing about
someone who's already dead!<PAGE>What's important is that fight to 
protect what's important to us now.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
I couldn't've said it 
better myself, <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Ah, it was nothing...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
What the... This is...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
What's up, <STR>(RIT)?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
This is what Alexei was using...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
It's the fake Dein Nomos.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
How'd it get here...?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Wasn't this destroyed 
in the fortress 
shrine of Zaude?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
Maybe they made 
multiple copies.<PAGE>That would make sense... Each of the 
copies is a control key for the blastia 
in its node of the network.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
Then the blastia here is also...?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
Yes... I thought it was strange!<PAGE>I never saw how Barbos could control this 
tower's blastia, as immense as it is, 
with that crude imitation he had.<PAGE>But if they had this one that 
Alexei made, I can believe it.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
Is it okay if we take that?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
It could cause the aer supply 
to stop working, and make the 
tower stop functioning, but...<PAGE>That's all right, right?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAV)
Sure, sure, no problem at all. 
Take it, would ya, lad?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
Take this...?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
So we're going to use the power that 
released the Adephagos to go and defeat 
it... I like the way that sounds.<PAGE>All right...

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
Let's go!
