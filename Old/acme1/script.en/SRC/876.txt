<STR>(RAP)!
Catch!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Same ol' 
<STR>(RAP)...

## POINTER 2
Rich
...<STR>(RAP)...?

## POINTER 3
Karen
<STR>(RAP)? I can't believe it...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? What do you mean?

## POINTER 5
Karen
Oh, it's just...he has the same 
name as a dog that someone 
we know used to have.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
You don't say...

## POINTER 7
Karen
Were you the one who 
named him <STR>(RAP)?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
No... It was a name given to 
him by his previous owner.

## POINTER 9
Rich
...Then he must be...

## POINTER 10
Karen
But...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
What is it?

## POINTER 12
Rich
...Hold on...

## POINTER 13
Rich
...Take this...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAP)
Wooo...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Hey now, what's this all about?

## POINTER 16
Rich
...This is an arte that was 
given to us by your mother...

## POINTER 17
Karen
You see, <STR>(RAP) was the name of one 
of the pups of a dog who belonged 
to an acquaintance of my father.<PAGE>But...after my father's friend 
died, <STR>(RAP) went missing.<PAGE>Soon after, <STR>(RAP)'s mother passed 
away, and she left behind a manual 
of technique that she used.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
There's still no guarantee that <STR>(RAP)'s 
the same person-- dog, I mean-- 
as the one in your story.<PAGE>It's still okay 
if we take that?

## POINTER 19
Rich
...Yes...
...Take 
it...

## POINTER 20
Karen
Hmmm, yes...
Only a dog 
would be able to use 
that arte, anyway.<PAGE>And it's only fitting that it 
be kept by a person-- a dog, 
that is-- who can use it.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Really...
Well then, 
we'll gladly take it.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
...But you can't 
read this, 
can you?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAP)
Woof woof!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
Okay, okay, I'll 
help you out.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAP)
Wooo!

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
Wow! <STR>(RAP) learned 
how to do it!<PAGE>...<STR>(YUR), were you up all night too?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah. I'm 
pooped.<PAGE>Are you happy, <STR>(RAP)?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RAP)
Wooo!
