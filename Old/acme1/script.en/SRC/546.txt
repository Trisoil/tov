It'll work!!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Connect the spirits directly
with the core and excite it!<PAGE>Converge the generated power onto 
Vesperia No. 1 through the four spirits 
and then use it against the the Adephagos.

## POINTER 2
Witcher
I was the one to find this method.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Synchronize this device with the barrier blastia
placed around the world and then use it to 
interfere with the surrounding blastia.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
???

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
...So you mean we can
transform the blastia core 
into spirits, right?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
That's what I have been telling you.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
I knew you could do it <STR>(RIT)!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Our only problem is time.<PAGE>We need to build the blastia core network and
prepare for the converge process simultaneously.

## POINTER 9
Witcher
I'll handle the network. We do have
some people from Aspio who can help too.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
We'll need a guard too. Better keep an
eye on the Monsters and the Adephagos.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(FRE)
The knights will take that position.

## POINTER 12
Sodia
We will protect all with our life.

## POINTER 13
Kaufman
The guild will backup wherever necessary.
We also have engineers who can help.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, this is going to work out!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
We just need to get close to
the Adephagos so that the power
of the spirits will reach it for sure,<PAGE>and then activate Vesperia No. 1.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
That means we need to get to...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
The Tower of Tarqaron.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RAV)
Duke's hideout.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
Are we going to fight him?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
I don't know.<PAGE>But we can't let 
him use Tarqaron.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
I guess we 
can't walk around it.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
We're departing tomorrow.<PAGE>Let's take a good rest today.
