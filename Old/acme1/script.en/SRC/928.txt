Does this stone look 
really worn down 
to anyone else?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
It looks like it's been 
pretty worn down by wind.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
...Huh...?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
That's the sword we got 
from the Elder in Myorzo.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Ack!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
Eeek!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Waaah!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Eek!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
Wahoo!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
Ahhh!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
...A spear came from inside the rock...?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Its shape... It looks like 
this is a fell arm, too.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
Yes, I think so.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
It seems like there's some sort 
of strange power linking these 
two weapons together.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, I think we can 
get inside from here!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
It doesn't look like we can go in.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Can you break that?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
I think it's impossible.<PAGE>A giant, hard rock like 
this... No way.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Maybe we can scale it?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
We don't need to get inside 
that badly, do we? 
Let's just go back.
