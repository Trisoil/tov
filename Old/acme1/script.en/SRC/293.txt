Oh my...what happened?<PAGE>I can't believe the mast would suddenly collapse like that...

## POINTER 1
Tokunaga
Are you all okay?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
We're fine, but...<PAGE>I hope <STR>(YUR) and the others are okay...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
I'm A-OK!<PAGE>But I dunno about the gang that 
went off on their own...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Yeah, it seems like I'm unharmed.<PAGE>I wonder how the kids that went 
off to investigate are doing?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. But are <STR>(YUR) and 
the others okay?!

## POINTER 6
Kaufman
I'd be surprised if they came out of an impact 
like that without a few scratches.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
I-I'm worried about everyone. Umm, would it 
be all right if we went and checked on them?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
I think we've gotta go and make 
sure they're okay. Is that okay?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
...Those troublesome kids. 
You mind if I go and make 
sure they're still alive?

## POINTER 10
Kaufman
Now, hold on just a second. Who'll 
protect the ship while you're gone?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
I'm sorry, but protecting 
<STR>(EST_P) is the guild's 
most important task!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
I'm sorry, but by ourselves 
we wouldn't be much help in 
protecting the ship, anyway.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
I have to look after <STR>(EST_P). 
Don't worry. The mermen were 
wiped out, after all.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
Don't worry, I don't think mermen would 
show up in a place like this. At least, 
my intuition says they wouldn't...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
Hey, I ain't in the guild, anyway! 
I don't have to look after your 
ship if I don't wanna!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm sorry! But I can't stand 
not knowing what happened 
to my friends...

## POINTER 17
Kaufman
Yes... I suppose we don't have a choice...

## POINTER 18
Tokunaga
Everyone, be careful.

## POINTER 19
Tokunaga
It sure is creepy with 
just us here...

## POINTER 20
Kaufman
Eek, don't say things like that! 
Talk about something more fun!
