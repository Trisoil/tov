Fresh air!!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Phew... Thank goodness.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Aww, I wanted to play 
a little more.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Should come back again? 
We can try a different 
route next time!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
You're not funny! Stop it!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
But I still gotta know...
What's with that voice, anyway?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm... No idea on that one.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
A ghost, probably.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
I told you! There's no such 
thing as ghosts!!<PAGE>I'm sure it was just some lame old 
mage who gets a kick from making
illusions for people to get lost in!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
All right, let's leave it at that, then.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
Good idea. Otherwise <STR>(RIT)'ll 
be in a rotten mood all week.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
But whaddaya think would make 
anyone wanna do that?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Our money, maybe?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
No way...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
It's nice to see the 
world is still full 
of mysteries.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, I agree.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
Anyway, let's get out of here! 
We're done with this place!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
I second that. We should go before 
we get yanked into another labyrinth.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Okay, okay.
