Yaaawn!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Good morning!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
This town's gotten 
pretty cozy.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Good morning, everybody!<PAGE>Huh? Is <STR>(JUD) 
still asleep?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
She wasn't in her room...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, good morning, everyone!

## POINTER 6
Kaufman
Well, I'll be off. 
Sorry I couldn't be 
of any more help.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
No, not at all. Thanks for your time.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
Ya had business with the president 
of Fortune's Market?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
She just came to give me an update on something 
I'd asked her about a while ago.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Something you asked her about... 
You mean the spear that was taken 
from you back in Ghasfarost?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
Yes.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
...The spear that you used to 
destroy all that blastia...<PAGE>So you've been looking for it.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
That was a pretty nice spear...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
So, did President Kaufman 
tell you anything useful?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
There hasn't been any news, 
so far as spears out on 
the market are concerned.<PAGE>So she said it might be a 
good idea to try to track 
down the Blood Alliance.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
The Blood Alliance, eh...
I wonder if they had another 
base besides Ghasfarost...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
So do you want to look for it?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
...Nah, that's okay.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Really? But you were so 
intent on finding it.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(JUD)
...Yeah. But it's reached the 
point that it might not be 
worth the trouble anymore.<PAGE>The Adephagos isn't going 
to wait for us while we 
look for it...you know?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
I see. Well, if you really don't mind, 
then we don't have to look for it.<PAGE>Anyway, we're all together... 
Shall we head out?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(JUD)
