<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_063)All finished?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_064)And are we done whispering secrets?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_065)I've heard your story up until this 
point, <STR>(YUR). And also the reason 
for the bounty on your head.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_066)First off, I owe you my thanks 
for protecting her.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS15_067)Oh, I've been meaning to express 
my gratitude as well, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_068)It's nothing. I was already out searching 
for that blastia thief.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_069)And that's where we have a problem.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_070)Hmm?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_071)Regardless of the circumstances, the imperial 
law cannot allow the obstruction of officers, 
jail breaking, and trespassing.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS15_072)I'm sorry. I'm afraid 
I told him everything.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_073)Don't be sorry. I mean,
I did all that stuff.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_074)Then I assume you are prepared to receive 
the punishment your actions deserve.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS15_075)<STR>(FRE)?!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_076)Do whatever you like, but just 
listen a minute, will you?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_077)So you can tell me how it was all done in order 
to get back the lower quarter's blastia core? 
That's what you wanted to say, right?

## POINTER 15

<VOICE>(VS15_078)Sir <STR>(FRE), I have news... Wh-what 
is <STR>(RIT) doing here?!

## POINTER 16

<VOICE>(VS15_079)I heard you refused an imperial 
request for assistance.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS15_080)Do you think it's all right for a mage 
employed by the empire to 
simply abandon her obligations?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_081)Who's that?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS15_082)Got me...

## POINTER 19

<VOICE>(VS15_083)...Humph, whatever. It's 
not like I care a whit 
about you either.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_084)I'll make the introductions. 
This is my second-in-command, Sodia.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_085)This is Witcher, a mage who 
offered his assistance to us 
at the laboratory in Aspio.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_086)This is my...

## POINTER 23
Sodia
<VOICE>(VS15_087)You...! Sir, it's the criminal 
from the wanted poster!!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_088)At ease, Sodia...! He 
is a friend of mine.

## POINTER 25
Sodia
<VOICE>(VS15_089)What?! But Sir, he's a wanted man!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_090)I've just heard his story. While he is 
guilty of minor crimes, the warrant for 
his arrest contains false accusations.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS15_091)Later, I will return him to the capital 
and explain the situation. <PAGE><VOICE>(VS15_092)And he will receive 
his due punishment.

## POINTER 27
Sodia
<VOICE>(VS15_093)My... my mistake, Sir. Witcher,
let's have your report.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS15_094)So we're done here, right?

## POINTER 29
Witcher
<VOICE>(VS15_095)I believe the ongoing 
rain and wind are being 
caused by a blastia.

## POINTER 30
Witcher
<VOICE>(VS15_096)The weather in this season is unpredictable, 
but this does not explain why it 
worsens whenever boats leave port.

## POINTER 31
Sodia
<VOICE>(VS15_097)We also have testimony that something 
like a blastia was carried into 
Magistrate Ragou's residence.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS15_098)I've never heard anything
about a blastia that 
controlled the weather. <PAGE><VOICE>(VS15_099)Nothing like that has ever been excavated... 
Wait, the aque blastia, the ruins... 
It couldn't be...

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_100)So his lordship, the magistrate, is using
a blastia to control the weather.

## POINTER 34
Sodia
<VOICE>(VS15_101)...It appears that way, though 
we can't yet say for certain.

## POINTER 35
Sodia
<VOICE>(VS15_102)The harbor has been closed due to 
weather. Any ship that leaves is fired 
on for disobeying the ordinance.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_103)So much for crossing 
over to Torim...

## POINTER 37
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_104)Those aren't the only rumors 
surrounding the magistrate.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS15_105)He's released a monster known as Rhybgaro into 
the wild, and amuses himself by forcing those 
who can't pay their taxes to hunt it.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS15_106)He claims he'll pardon their taxes if 
they can manage to capture the beast.

## POINTER 38
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS15_107)How cruel...

## POINTER 39
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS15_108)That injured couple we met 
near the entrance must be 
two of his victims.

## POINTER 40
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS15_109)And their child...

## POINTER 41
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS15_110)What? What happened to their child?

## POINTER 42
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_111)Forget about it.

## POINTER 43
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_112)Well, it's been a hell of a day for 
us and we're tired. Let's just stay 
at this inn for the night.

## POINTER 44
Sodia
<VOICE>(VS15_113)Also...we can't forget about 
a certain "missing person..."

## POINTER 45
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS15_114)...Missing person?
