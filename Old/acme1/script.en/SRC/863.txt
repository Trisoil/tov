Isn't this the same box that 
we found in the Atherum and 
delivered to that girl?

It looks like it's unlocked.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
Eh? 'Zat a journal?

"I think that today is the day that I'm going 
to stop waiting for you to come back."<PAGE>"It's been three years since those travelers 
came to town with the box, but they came 
with no word of what happened to you..."<PAGE>"The box that I gave you as a gift, which you guarded 
with your life... There's no way you would have ever 
given it up so long as you were strong and well."<PAGE>"I'm sure you would want 
me to move on and look for 
happiness yet again."<PAGE>"That's why it's time that I said farewell. 
Thank you for everything you've done for me."

Her name was Yuefan, wasn't 
it? What a strong girl.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Well, I guess ya can't really move on 
in life if ya spend all yer time waitin' 
for someone who's passed on.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Y-you all don't think that there's
something a little unusual about this?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
About what?

<STR>(JUD)
The version of Yormgen that we went to 
was an illusion that Phaeroh created...<PAGE>And yet the box we delivered in the illusion...is right here.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
And the travelers she wrote about in the 
journal...that would be us, wouldn't it?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
So the Atherum was in our modern 
time, and the box was, too.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
H-huh? Y-you're right, but...how 
could this be possible?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
It looks like the
world's still chock
full of mysteries.
