Hey!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Wah! ...Y-you 
startled me...<PAGE>Huh? Aren't 
you...<PAGE>H-harry...right?

## POINTER 3
Harry
Weren't you practicing 
here last time, too?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Oh...yeah... I always have 
trouble sleeping whenever 
I come back to this city...

## POINTER 5
Harry
...Because of the Don?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
...Yeah. I want to
be strong, like
he was.<PAGE>Every time I think of what he did, I 
feel like I have to work harder...

## POINTER 7
Harry
......

## POINTER 8
Harry
...You can borrow this.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
What's this...?

## POINTER 10
Harry
It's the sword that the Don used.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
It's heavy... It 
feels heavier than 
it looks...

## POINTER 12
Harry
Yes, all of the responsibility 
of holding the guild together 
is contained in that sword...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
...Yeah.

## POINTER 14
Harry
I'll let you use it whenever you're practicing here. It should 
make for better training than what you've had in the past.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
I can use this sword...?

## POINTER 16
Harry
I'm just lending it to you, though! You 
have to give it back in the morning.<PAGE>I still need to work on 
mastering it, myself...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
I see... Thank you.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
The Don's sword... 
All right then...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
Dyeeaah! Hyaaah!
