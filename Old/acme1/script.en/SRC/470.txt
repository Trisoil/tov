Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_065)...Are you going out alone?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_066)I don't think that's any of 
Your Highness's concern.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_067)I want to know how things 
are in the lower quarter, so 
I'm just gonna go take a look.

## POINTER 2
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_068)The Council has decided to bring 
formal charges of criminal conspiracy 
against Alexei.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_069)The Knights are currently forming a strategy 
for reentering the capital from Deidon Hold.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_070)With all that aer in the city? 
I doubt they'll get very far.

## POINTER 4
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_071)...<STR>(EST) 
is with Alexei, 
isn't she?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_072)How did... So you caught on, 
huh? I wondered why you 
didn't bring her up earlier.

## POINTER 6
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_073)What do you intend to do about her?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_074)What do you mean?

## POINTER 8
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_075)...All those who carry the imperial 
blood possess a certain power.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_076)In most of us it is too faint 
to be of use, but I have heard 
that hers is extraordinary.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS48_077)I'm sure it was for this reason that the 
Council threw their support behind her.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_078)Why are you bringing this up now?

## POINTER 10
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_079)Isn't this current disaster 
being caused by her power?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_080)So what if it is?

## POINTER 12
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_081)The Knights may have to... 
You're aware that defeating 
Alexei may not be enough.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_082)That's not going to happen.

## POINTER 14
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_083)...Because you'll 
do it yourself?

## POINTER 15
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_084)<STR>(FRE) told me about you. That 
you always try to carry far too 
much on your own shoulders.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_085)You can tell him that 
we'll be just fine 
without the help.

## POINTER 17
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_086)But why?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_087)I thought I told you, this 
isn't your concern.

## POINTER 19
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_088)That sword... Perhaps 
you are just the person 
it was waiting for.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS48_089)Keep talking and I'll 
try it out on you.

## POINTER 21
Ioder
<VOICE>(VS48_090)...Forgive me.
