Hey guys, look...!

## POINTER 1

Come see us again real soon, 'kay?

## POINTER 2
Gauche
Okay...

## POINTER 3
Droite
That's a promise.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
...We run into each other 
in the craziest places.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Whoa now, let's take it easy. 
This isn't really the time...

## POINTER 6

What's wrong, Gauche? Droite?

## POINTER 7
Droite
Ah, umm...

## POINTER 8
Gauche
…………

## POINTER 9
Gauche
Goodbye...

## POINTER 10
Droite
Kay, bye!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
Now whaddya s'pose 
those two're up to...?

## POINTER 12

Pardon me, but...are 
you acquaintances of 
the two young ladies?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
I wouldn't say 
acquaintances, really...

## POINTER 14

Oh, I'm so relieved.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Huh?!

## POINTER 16

I worry about those girls. They 
have the misfortune of being easily 
misunderstood, you see...<PAGE>But now that I see they have this many 
friends, I can stop my worrying.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
Misunderstood? But they're 
members of Leviath--oof!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RAV)
And how might you know 
our friends, Miss?

## POINTER 19

I am the governess of this home, and 
they once lived under its roof.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Home?

## POINTER 21

This orphanage was built to shelter those 
children who have no one to depend on.<PAGE>The two of them lost their family 
in the war ten years ago.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
She's gotta mean the Great War...

## POINTER 23

Hey, who are they?

## POINTER 24

If they're our big sis' enemies, 
I'll beat 'em up!

## POINTER 25

Here now, hush, 
both of you.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(EST_P)
How generous and kind of you. 
It must not be an easy job...

## POINTER 27

Oh my, no. I could never manage all 
of this alone. It is all made possible 
by the donations I receive.<PAGE>Yeager is his name.
He really does too much for us...

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RAV)
Yeager?! But what'd 
he want ta do a thing 
like that for...?

## POINTER 29

I don't know his reasons. 
But he has never asked 
for anything in return.

## POINTER 30

Nanny! I'm hungry!

## POINTER 31

Oh yes, it's time, isn't it? 
I'm sorry, I must be going...

## POINTER 32
<STR>(JUD)
I wonder what it could mean. 
I wouldn't think he would have 
much interest in charity.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(RIT)
Something's going on here. I 
mean, those two are obviously 
Yeager's personal guard.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(KAR)
You don't think he raised 
them as orphans just to make 
them his underlings?!

## POINTER 35
<STR>(RAV)
He just might try somethin' like 
that. Huh? What is it, lass?

## POINTER 36
<STR>(EST_P)
...Oh, I... When we were talking with 
her just now, I truly felt that whoever 
did this had good intentions...<PAGE>But can that person... 
Can that really be 
the Yeager we know?

## POINTER 37
<STR>(YUR)
Your guess is as good as mine.

## POINTER 38
<STR>(EST_P)
...
