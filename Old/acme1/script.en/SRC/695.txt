Some pretty flowers to give to your 
parents? Or your sister? Or someone 
you love...? Oh, you over there...<PAGE>Ah, it's you...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Aren't you the woman from the orphanage...?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Ah, so you're actually a florist!

## POINTER 3

N-no... That's not 
quite right...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Then why are you selling flowers...?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
...You need money, don't you?

## POINTER 6

W-well, you see...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Ah, yes...now that Yeager's 
gone, the orphanage doesn't 
have any money?

## POINTER 8

Unfortunately, that's the case...we've actually 
been renting the orphanage building from 
a certain well-known man in town.<PAGE>But since we've stopped receiving 
contributions from Yeager, we're 
no longer able to pay that debt.<PAGE>The rent for the building aside, it takes 
a lot of money to feed the children...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
But aren't some of the kids 
out and workin' now?

## POINTER 10

They're all still struggling to make a living 
for themselves. It would be far too much to 
ask them for help with something like this.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
What about that pair of assertive young ladies from the orphanage?

## POINTER 12

Gauche and Droite are in the same situation.<PAGE>They were both working 
for Yeager.<PAGE>But now that he's passed away, 
they're probably having just 
as hard a time as anybody.

## POINTER 13

...Oh, sir, would you like 
to buy some flowers...?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Is she really going to be able to 
pay off their debt like that?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Maybe she'll be able to make a 
little profit, but I don't know 
about paying off that debt...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
It kind of...hurts to 
watch, doesn't it?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
Please, take this. You should be able 
to sell it for a good amount of money.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Whoa, whoa, are you 
sure it's okay to 
give that away?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm just doing something 
that the empire should've 
done already. That's all.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
But if you give that away, won't that 
mean you won't have any other proof 
of being in the imperial family?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
No, it's okay. Not 
having this won't 
change who I am.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
Before we go any further here, how 
much is it that you need, exactly?

## POINTER 23

Let's see... 500,000 Gald 
should be enough...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
We've got that much.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(KAR)
I mean, I suppose we 
have it, but it's still 
a lot of dough...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah...

## POINTER 27
Pay 500,000 gald?
Do not pay
Pay

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
We'll give you the 
500,000 Gald.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
Wh-what are you saying...?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
Don't be such a scrooge!

## POINTER 31

But I can't just let 
you give me so much 
of your own money...

## POINTER 32
<STR>(YUR)
We're not the ones 
paying you.<PAGE>Isn't that right, <STR>(EST_P)?

## POINTER 33
<STR>(EST_P)
Huh? Why me...?

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
Didn't you say you were just 
doing something that the empire 
should've done already?<PAGE>So we're just spotting them the money until 
they take responsibility for it themselves.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(EST_P)
Huh? So you mean...

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
Once you go back, see if you can 
get the Council to pay us back for 
giving the orphanage this money.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(EST_P)
Y-yes...I'll 
do it...!

## POINTER 38

What are you talking about...?

## POINTER 39
<STR>(YUR)
This money is assistance from the empire, so you 
can take it and not have to feel bad about it.

## POINTER 40

Ummm...well, I don't really 
understand, but...

## POINTER 41
<STR>(YUR)
...It's tough 
to explain. You 
do it, <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 42
<STR>(KAR)
What? M-me?

## POINTER 43
<STR>(YUR)
You like explaining things, right?

## POINTER 44
<STR>(KAR)
N-not particularly...but 
I'll give it a go.

## POINTER 45
<STR>(KAR)
She said she would work 
hard and pay us back 
for the money, but...

## POINTER 46
<STR>(YUR)
The empire'll reimburse 
us. Right, <STR>(EST_P)?

## POINTER 47
<STR>(EST_P)
I'll ask Ioder about it. If 
he refuses, then...I'm sorry.

## POINTER 48
<STR>(KAR)
You're "sorry"...?!

## POINTER 49
<STR>(YUR)
We'll cross that bridge when we come 
to it. We're just asking you to twist 
His Highness's arm a little.

## POINTER 50
<STR>(EST_P)
I'll try 
my best!

## POINTER 51
<STR>(YUR)
Okay, let's go.

## POINTER 52
Information
You paid 500,000 Gald.

## POINTER 53
<STR>(YUR)
It's a lot of money. We don't have 
to make a final decision just yet.

## POINTER 54
<STR>(KAR)
...Well said, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 55
<STR>(EST_P)
Then I guess the only solution 
is if she takes my...

## POINTER 56
<STR>(YUR)
No matter how much that's worth, it couldn't 
possibly be enough, could it?

## POINTER 57
<STR>(EST_P)
But...

## POINTER 58
<STR>(YUR)
Don't rush things. Let's give some more 
thought as to whether or not we could 
still get by if we gave her the money.

## POINTER 59
<STR>(YUR)
I'm sorry about not being 
able to help out for now...

## POINTER 60

No, that's okay...

## POINTER 61
<STR>(JUD)
That's quite a hefty sum. I'm afraid 
we don't have that kind of money.

## POINTER 62
<STR>(EST_P)
Then I guess the only solution is if she takes my...

## POINTER 63
<STR>(YUR)
We can work hard 
and save up that 
much, right?

## POINTER 64
<STR>(EST_P)
Wait, you don't mean...

## POINTER 65
<STR>(RIT)
He means that we all understand 
how you feel, <STR>(EST_P), and 
we want to help. Right?

## POINTER 66
<STR>(YUR)
...Well, yeah, you could say that.

## POINTER 67
<STR>(KAR)
We'll come back when we've saved 
up enough. Be patient!â™ª

## POINTER 68

What? I... I... 
Really...?

## POINTER 69

Phew...what should I 
do...? If I only had...500,000 
Gald...

## POINTER 70
Pay 500,000 gald?
Do not pay
Pay
