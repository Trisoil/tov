What's this...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Some sort of 
ruins? Maybe?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
But it doesn't look 
like humans built 
anything here.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(JUD_P), do you know anything 
about this place?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
No. To me, it looks like it 
was formed naturally, rather 
than made by human hands.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
There's not anythin' here, 
from the looks of it.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Well, let's have a look around, at least.
