This isn't about luck.

I went to check the barrier blastia.<PAGE>Its power had been raised.<PAGE>And I guess the monsters 
were drawn to it.<PAGE>The power is returned to normal now.

We thought raising the power will protect
us but, it turned out to be the opposite.

## POINTER 6
Natz
I'll go see the citizens.<PAGE>Feel free to rest here 
as long as you please.
