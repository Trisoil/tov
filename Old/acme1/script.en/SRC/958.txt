Kiss your freedom goodbye, 
for it ends today!

Adecor
I say, prepare to face the 
Imperial Knights' ultimate fighting 
technique: the burst arte!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Again, you're claiming regular 
techniques as your own... That 
doesn't belong to the Knights!

## POINTER 3
Adecor
I say, be quiet!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
The Burst Arte, huh...
I've heard of it before, but...

## POINTER 5
Boccos
You don't know how 
it's done? You fool!

## POINTER 6
Adecor
I say, we shall show you!<PAGE>But before that happens, you'll be 
reduced to no more than a worthless 
caterpillar crawling on the ground!

## POINTER 7
Adecor
Rargh!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Maybe it has something 
to do with Over Limit...

## POINTER 9
Boccos
Go! Show him 
how it's done, 
Adecor!

## POINTER 10
Adecor
I say, watch me now...!<PAGE>The arcane arte of 
the Imperial Knights!

## POINTER 11
Boccos
It didn't hit him! 
What are you doing?!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Huh. Burst artes 
can be linked from 
an arcane arte.<PAGE>I wonder if I could imitate that...

## POINTER 13
Adecor
Ha, there's no way an 
amateur could do 
something like that, I say!

## POINTER 14

...And now, Over Limit...!

## POINTER 16
Boccos
Wah, be careful! 
<STR>(YUR) Lowell's going 
to attack!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Arcane arte...!

## POINTER 18

those, but how about this?!
