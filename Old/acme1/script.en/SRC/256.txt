<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS24_028)It seems like the area 
has returned to normal.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS24_029)Yeah. Doesn't look like it's 
gone berserk since then.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS24_030)Hey, it's those guys we 
met at Nor Harbor...

## POINTER 3
Pauly
<VOICE>(VS24_031)Miss <STR>(EST_P)!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS24_032)How have you been?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS24_033)Who is this?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS24_034)We helped these people 
out at Nor Harbor.

## POINTER 7
Kellas
<VOICE>(VS24_035)We can't thank you enough 
for all you've done for us.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS24_036)Where is your father?

## POINTER 9
Kellas
<VOICE>(VS24_037)I haven't seen Teagle--my 
husband-- for the past 
three days...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS24_038)It sounds like that 
rumor might be true...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS24_039)Don't you have any hunches?

## POINTER 12
Kellas
<VOICE>(VS24_040)Yes... The night before he 
disappeared, he talked again 
about working to become a noble...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS24_041)Become a noble? 
What do you mean?

## POINTER 14
Kellas
<VOICE>(VS24_042)When this city is finally completed, 
we will be able to live here as 
members of the nobility.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS24_043)Huh? That doesn't 
sound quite right.

## POINTER 16
Kellas
<VOICE>(VS24_044)What do you mean?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS24_045)The rank of nobility is reserved for 
those whose service has earned 
the emperor's confidence.

## POINTER 18
Kellas
<VOICE>(VS24_046)B-but, Sir Cumore gave his 
word to us! He said we would 
be welcomed as nobles!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS24_047)Cumore... From the 
Imperial Knights?

## POINTER 20
Kellas
<VOICE>(VS24_048)Yes. He is acting as the current 
magistrate of the city.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS24_049)I'll bet he is...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS24_050)That is strange, though. 
I mean, the imperial 
throne is empty and all.

## POINTER 23
Kellas
<VOICE>(VS24_051)But then... Then why on earth 
have we been working this hard? 
And what about Teagle...?

## POINTER 24
Pauly
<VOICE>(VS24_052)Is Father not 
coming back...?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS24_053)Hey, <STR>(YUR)...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS24_054)You're gonna ask me why 
we don't take this on 
as a guild, right?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS24_055)I promise to take care of 
her fee when I pay my own.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS24_056)Well...okay, that's fine.

## POINTER 29
Kellas
<VOICE>(VS24_057)What? But I...

## POINTER 30
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS24_058)So this means our next job 
is finding a missing person.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS24_059)And if Cumore's up to his usual 
stunts, we'll just have to slap 
him around till he stops.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS24_060)Right. The Knights do exist for the 
protection of the people, after all.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS24_061)L-let's just make 
sure we're careful.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS24_062)The Knights could squash 
a little guild like us if we 
get on their bad side.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS24_063)As you wish.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS24_064)We'll find your father, 
I promise. Just wait 
right here.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS24_065)Well, that's that. 
We'll take the job.

## POINTER 37
Kellas
<VOICE>(VS24_066)Thank you. 
Thank you so much!

## POINTER 38
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS24_067)All right, let's go find him.

## POINTER 39
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS24_068)There's something very suspicious 
about that area over there.

## POINTER 40
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS24_069)Yeah. Even more so 
because it's marked 
off-limits.

## POINTER 41
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS24_070)I wonder if there's some 
way we could get in...

## POINTER 42
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS24_071)Careful, guys. Remember? Careful...
