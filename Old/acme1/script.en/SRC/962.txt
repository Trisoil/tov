That one room's been locked 
shut for a long time now.<PAGE>Apparently a famous locksmith 
forged the lock, so getting into 
the room is no simple feat.<PAGE>They say the locksmith locked 
himself in a prison whose locks 
he'd made himself, as a test.<PAGE>But he soon realized that he wasn't 
able to get past his own locks.<PAGE>And so he was stuck in that prison for good. 
A pretty dumb story, if you ask me.<PAGE>I wonder if that prison 
exists somewhere...<PAGE>Oh, I'm actually doing inventory here, 
right now. Please make your purchases 
at the next counter over.
