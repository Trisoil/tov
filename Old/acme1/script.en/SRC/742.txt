## POINTER 0

Welcome to IACCRO's official 
testing facility! Are you 
here to take the test?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
I...uh...
I don't even know what 
ta say ta that.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Well, first off, what 
sort of place is this?

## POINTER 3

This is where you can take the 
Imperial Academic Conference 
Collaborative Research 
Organization's certification test!<PAGE>We've set the hurdle rather high, 
but passing this fine examination 
will earn you a special doctoral degree!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
H-h-hold on a second! IACCRO...you 
mean the top research organization 
in the whole empire?<PAGE>The famous organization recognized by
Researcher's Weekly, the top academic journal
for peer review and research presentations?

## POINTER 5

Oh, quite impressive! It 
seems you are no stranger 
to our field of study.<PAGE>Then you are no doubt familiar with the 
"Miska Doctoral Degree?" You can
take the test to get that degree here!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Quit pulling my leg! The Miska 
degree is the highest honor a 
blastia researcher can achieve!<PAGE>You expect me to believe that you 
can take a test for something like 
that here, of all places? Hah!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, <STR>(YUR). Are those two 
speaking in another language, 
or is it just me?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
I don't understand what they're 
talking about, either. I guess all 
we can do is see what happens.

## POINTER 9

The original test can only be taken in the 
imperial capital, it is true. But our facility is 
recognized as an official alternate site.<PAGE>Actually, it was at this 
site where I received 
the degree, myself.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
You're saying that YOU are the single 
person who's managed to obtain 
the Miska Doctoral Degree...?!

## POINTER 11

Oh, I'm afraid I forgot 
to introduce myself. 
I'm Miska Jutalion.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Whaaaaaaaaa! Hold on, you 
can't be serious...!!<PAGE>Are you saying you're the same Miska 
Jutalion who discovered magical antibodies? 
You're THAT Miska Jutalion?!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
That's a person?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, looks like it. 
He's standing on
two legs, isn't he?

## POINTER 15
Miska
Yes, I am the same Miska 
Jutalion who discovered 
magical antibodies.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
Ummm, <STR>(RIT)? I'm not really sure 
we all understand what you've 
been talking about...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
Ahhh, right. Simply put, this 
person is the most renowned
blastia researcher in the world.<PAGE>I've always felt a certain connection to 
what he wrote in his research papers, 
and his ideas are very close to my own.<PAGE>I had never met him before, 
but I guess I felt like we 
were close nonetheless...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
So you were trying to get this 
"Miska Doctoral Degree?"

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
To be honest, I never really cared about other 
prizes or papers, but I always thought, if I 
could only get the Miska Doctoral Degree...

## POINTER 20
Miska
Oh my! How flaaattering that 
you could have so much
respect for what I've done!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
I guess ya can't 
judge a cow by 
its udder...

## POINTER 22
Miska
So, what do you say? Would 
you like to take the test?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
We've already come all the way out 
here...what do you say, <STR>(RIT)? I'm sure 
you'll pass with flying colors!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(EST_P)'s right. We wouldn't be 
able to go to the original test 
site in the capital, anyway.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
Are there any requirements for taking
the certification test? Anything I need?

## POINTER 26
Miska
You're determined. I can tell from 
the look in your eyes. You remind 
me of myself when I was your age.<PAGE>All of the items that you need in order 
to take the test are written on this
piece of paper. Make sure not to lose it.

## POINTER 27
Miska
If you come back with those 
five books, you'll be able to
take the test.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RIT)
"The Village Carpeted with Flowers"
"Reflections on the Scent of the Sea"
"Urban Planning for Bustling Cities"<PAGE>"The Legend that Sleeps in Searing Sands"
"Against a Backdrop of New Hope"

## POINTER 29
Miska
Think of the search for these 
books as the first part of your test.
Good luck!âˆ€

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
Since it's books we're looking for, maybe 
we should look in the sort of places that 
you'd normally find things to read?

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RIT)
Right. Let's go around and 
see if we can think of any 
good places to search.
