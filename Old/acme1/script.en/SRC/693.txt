Why would you use your healing artes 
on someone who tells you not to?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Master...<PAGE>I just wanted to make 
that person happy...

## POINTER 2
Drake
Every single one of a princess's actions 
is exceedingly meaningful.<PAGE>Countless people are affected by what 
you do, and if you're not careful, 
they can result in confusion.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Isn't it better than sitting 
around doing nothing at all?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)...

## POINTER 5
Drake
Sometimes the best course of action 
is taking no action at all.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
What about all the people back in Halure that <STR>(EST_P) 
helped? They're grateful for what she did.

## POINTER 7
Drake
Are you aware that due to that action, a 
strange rumor of the appearance of a "princess 
of redemption" has taken shape?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
What's so bad about that?

## POINTER 9
Drake
Once you get people's hopes up, they expect things 
from you. And these expectations grow and grow, until 
their hopes are finally dashed against reality.<PAGE>Once you fail to live up to their expectations, people 
become discontented, and this results in chaos.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
B-but...

## POINTER 11
Drake
Luckily, none of the townspeople are 
aware that their princess of redemption 
is in fact the Princess herself.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
I...

## POINTER 13
Drake
To rule an empire, you must think rationally, 
and not be swayed by fleeting emotion.

## POINTER 14
Drake
You are not cut out to sit on the imperial 
throne. It would be best if you stepped down 
from the candidacy as soon as possible.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
What should 
I do?!

## POINTER 16
Drake
Here, take this.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
This is...the imperial 
crest...

## POINTER 18
Drake
Look at that and put some 
thought into your actions.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
......

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, keep your chin up.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm okay... Master Drake 
told me to put some thought 
into what I'm doing.<PAGE>So that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to think about whether 
my actions are really the right ones for a future empress.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
I see. Good luck with 
that, <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. Thank you.
