Sir, you wouldn't happen to have 
any Luluria Petals, would you?

## POINTER 1

Who'd you hear that from? 
I mean, I do, but...

## POINTER 2

Ahh, so that's why you need a petal.

## POINTER 3

The luluria is one of the 
three flowers that blooms 
on Halure's tree.<PAGE>The petals are dried for half a year in 
the shade, and they're very valuable.

## POINTER 4

This is my last petal, but if it'll restore the tree 
to its old self, then I don't mind giving it to you.
