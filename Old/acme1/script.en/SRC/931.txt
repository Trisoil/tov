So this is an aer 
krene too...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
I guess there are more 
around the world 
than we thought?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
You think there are still 
more in other places?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
I think there might be. There are surely 
a lot of places on the planet that 
humans haven't laid eyes on.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
How's it look, 
<STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
All I have to do 
is get close, right?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Aha, there 
we go!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Let me see.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
The geometry's already 
changed.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
And that means?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Time for a test shot!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Wow, it powered 
up a lot!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
It got faster, and 
moves farther now!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Judging from the size of the 
Sorcerer's Ring, I think 
it's reached its limit.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
I think this is 
enough to do what 
we need to do.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
I hafta say, I'm surprised 
at all of the different 
effects aer can have.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
Well, you see--

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
But I feel like all of those effects 
are simply different ways of 
aer interacting with itself.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
Well, aer's high affinity creates--

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
And then, the application of those effects 
on certain objects allowed the technologies 
of blastia and magic to be developed.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Well, converted mana is--

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
So aer is divided into different attributes in 
the form of magic, and when it's used, it releases 
energy and then turns into aer again.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RAV)
So that's how aer's helped 
sustain our day-to-day 
lives, eh...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
I give up...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
No, your explanations are just 
too hard to understand!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(KAR)
...But the civilization we have, 
based on aer and blastia, is 
about to come to an end...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(JUD)
Well, we'll still have elemental spirits!

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RAV)
Yeah, we've still got some time until 
we gotta give it all up, too. 
Until then, use it or lose it!

## POINTER 28
<STR>(KAR)
...Yeah, you're right.<PAGE>Well, we can at least be thankful that the 
Sorcerer's Ring is even more useful now.
