Wow, what a strange group of people. A dog 
and even a couple of kids...and they don't 
look like they're related, either.

As the gateway to all of Tolbyccia, 
Capua Torim sees its fair 
share of interesting folks.<PAGE>A motley crew like theirs isn't 
too uncommon among all of the 
guilds that pass through here.

But I could swear that 
I've seen that young man 
somewhere before...

## POINTER 3

You too, ma'am? To tell the truth, 
he looks familiar to me, too.<PAGE>I wonder where I've seen his face...

Your room is the last 
one down, on the right. 
Have a pleasant stay.
