I can't believe this is Dein Nomos...the 
proof of imperial succession.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(YUR), you can become the emperor!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
This is just for decoration. 
I wouldn't wanna be the emperor 
even if I could.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
Duke went around using 
that sword to control 
aer krene...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Oh! So Duke's doing 
the same thing as 
the Entelexeia?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
Maybe so.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
That sword...it produced the same 
phenomenon as <STR>(EST_P) did.<PAGE>Maybe the Rizomata Formula was already 
worked out once before? But then, why 
was that information lost?<PAGE>Maybe it's related to the cataclysm, like 
the way that the blastia was lost?<PAGE>Why did that become an Imperial treasure?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
There are tons of things we don't know about 
this sword, but let's wait to figure them 
out until we've settled things here.<PAGE>Right now, rescuing <STR>(EST_P) 
is our top priority.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Right. Let's hurry!
