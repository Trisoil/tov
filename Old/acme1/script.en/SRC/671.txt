You kids have a nice chat?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(RAV), were you waiting 
for us outside?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
Yeah, I didn't wanna butt in 
on two old friends catchin' up. 
Wouldn't be right, ya know.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
That's unusually considerate 
of you, old man.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
I didn't expect to hear you talking 
so happily about your time in 
the Imperial Knights, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Oh yeah?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
I mean, it seemed to me like 
you didn't enjoy your time 
as a knight very much.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Joining them was a 
decision I made myself.<PAGE>It's not all bad memories. Practice 
wasn't so bad, and I had all sorts of fun 
with my fellow knights-in-training.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
From the way that knight was 
talking, it sounds like you acted like 
a crazy and rambunctious kid.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(RIT), if there's one person who 
doesn't need to be scolding me for a 
little youthful indiscretion, it's you.
