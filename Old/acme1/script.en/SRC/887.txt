Ack!
E-excuse me!

## POINTER 1

Oh no, excuse me. Here, 
you dropped this book.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, yes... Thank 
you very much.

## POINTER 3

The Collector's Book, eh...? Yours contains 
an impressive amount of data. <PAGE>It seems you've found lots of rare 
items. This is quite intriguing.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh? It is?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RIT)'s always saying how we haven't 
found nearly enough...

## POINTER 6

Ahem!
If it wouldn't be 
too much trouble...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Y-yes?

## POINTER 8

Do you think I might be able to borrow 
this book for a short while?<PAGE>If I had one month...no, even two 
weeks, that would be enough! Please! 
Please let me borrow it.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Ah, well...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
No, you can't. That's 
too long, anyway.

## POINTER 11

Ack! Mordio!
Y-you know this
young lady?!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah. I know you don't wanna hear this...<PAGE>But we can't give 
you the book yet.

## POINTER 13

Wh-why?!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
We still haven't completed it yet. If 
you'd like to look at it, wouldn't 
a complete book be better, anyway?<PAGE>We don't want to have to lend 
it to you every time we 
make an update, either.

## POINTER 15

Err, I... I see, yes.<PAGE>Then once you've finished filling in that book, 
allow me to borrow it for a bit! Of course, I 
don't expect you to lend it to me for nothing.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, you don't have to give us anything! Really, 
it's quite all right. We'll bring it to 
you once we've finished updating it.

## POINTER 17

Th-thank you!<PAGE>My name is Giovanni. You probably 
already know this, but 
I'm a researcher her.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
Okay, Mr. Giovanni. We'll bring 
you the Collector's Book as 
soon as it's completed.

## POINTER 19
Giovanni
Oh, thank you so much! I'm 
looking forward to it.
