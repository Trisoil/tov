<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA018_001)I didn't really think about 
it before we started taking 
on these jobs, but...<PAGE><VOICE>(VA018_002)Keeping a guild going 
is really tough..

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA018_003)What's with the deep 
thoughts, all of a sudden?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA018_004)Well, I mean it's pretty obvious 
why we started taking on 
work in the first place.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA018_005)Because we like seeing 
people smile...?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA018_006)But what happens if we help out 
the wrong people, or end up 
doing more harm than good?<PAGE><VOICE>(VA018_007)Then we'd be getting the 
total opposite results of 
what we set out to do.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA018_008)Yeah, but take that guy... 
Nobis, right? He looked 
pretty happy in the end.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA018_009)I hope they can restart 
their guild now that 
everything is finished.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA018_010)And the man from Ruins' Gate 
was pretty excited when 
we returned his shovel.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA018_011)A little too excited, if ya ask 
me. I mean, it's a shovel.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA018_012)Some people, like Mimula, will 
try to use us for the wrong 
reasons, too, though.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA018_013)You always have to watch the good, 
the bad, even the ugly, sometimes. 
That's what guilds do.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA018_014)I just wish we could take a pass 
on the bad and the ugly...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA018_015)We just need to stand up to those 
things when we come across them.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA018_016)Everybody's born 
with a bad side.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA018_017)That's not so. There is something beautiful 
in the core of each and every person.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA018_018)We may have to try harder to see it in 
people who do things they shouldn't...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA018_019)Peace, love, and understandin', huh?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA018_020)Don't make fun of me. Bad
people always have reasons
for what they do.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA018_021)Actually, Your Highness, I beg ta 
differ with ya on that point.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA018_022)Anyway, goals are important, 
but you don't always have 
to achieve them..

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA018_023)Maybe you're right...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA018_024)If everyone's happy where they 
are, who cares if it's not the 
goal they were going for?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA018_025)Even if that means 
failing sometimes?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA018_026)You cut your losses, and 
move on to whatever's next.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA018_027)Even if you wind up naked in 
the street, you're not finished 
as long as you're still breathing.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA018_028)Huh? Naked? Did our lovely 
<STR>(JUD) here just say somethin' 
about gettin' naked?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA018_029)Down, boy. Down...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA018_030)Well, <STR>(YUR). Are you on 
<STR>(RAV)'s side, or mine?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA018_031)Hold on, when did we start choosing sides...?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA018_032)What's so tough about this?<PAGE><VOICE>(VA018_033)You just have to learn from your mistakes. ...That's 
the basis for any kind of learning.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA018_034)<STR>(RIT)...

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA018_035)For starters, just try to 
enjoy the ride a bit more, 
like these clowns do.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA018_036)...Yeah, I will.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(RAP)
<VOICE>(VA018_037)Woof!
