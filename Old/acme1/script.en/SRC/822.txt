<STR>(RAV)
It's sure gotta weird feelin' to it.

## POINTER 2

Good afternoon, 
visitors!

## POINTER 3

This is your first time 
here, am I right?<PAGE>First of all, you'll 
need to buy tickets.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Tickets? We need 
tickets to go in?

## POINTER 5

Correct. They're only 
10 Gald per person 
to buy, though.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
That's all? You've gotta be joking.

## POINTER 7

Not at all! We're not doing this 
to make a profit. For us, it's all 
about helping others have fun.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
What's going on 
here, anyway?

## POINTER 9

It's not easy to summarize, 
but basically, it's like 
a big, fun party!<PAGE>I think the best way to understand 
what I mean would be to just go 
in and have a look for yourself.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)

## POINTER 11
Buy ticket?
Buy ticket
Do not buy ticket

## POINTER 12

Thank you very 
much. Here are 
your tickets.

## POINTER 13

You can go and come as you please, 
so just have a good time and 
don't worry about anything!<PAGE>You'll need to use chips for everything while 
you're here.  Make sure to go and exchange 
your Gald for chips in the Gymnasium.

## POINTER 14

Oh... It looks like you 
don't have enough Gald. 
I'm terribly sorry...

## POINTER 15

Please come again!

## POINTER 16
