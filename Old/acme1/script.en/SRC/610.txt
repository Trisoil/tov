Back again, huh?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Sheesh, we missed you too, pal.

## POINTER 2

Afraid I don't really have any 
jobs to offer you right now.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
It's cool. We'll try again later.

## POINTER 4

Actually... It might be better to 
say that I'm not gonna have any 
for you in the future, either.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? Why not?

## POINTER 6

There's getting to be more guilds 
with even less experience in 
this racket than you guys.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, but we're not exactly 
seasoned pros yet ourselves.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
It's always been that way, what with 
formin' a guild bein' free, and all.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
So you get new guilds 
springing up day in 
and day out, huh?

## POINTER 10

Sure do. With the way things are, the ones 
who're still going strong after a month 
can't rightly be called rookies anymore.<PAGE>Besides, you guys've been getting 
your name out there well enough. Can't 
see that you need us anymore.<PAGE>Why not try your hand at 
finding work on your own?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Well, if you've made up your mind about 
it, we don't have much choice.

## POINTER 12

Nothing personal, you know. I'll 
be rooting for Brave Vesperia's 
success in my own way.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
All right, then. Thanks for all the help.
