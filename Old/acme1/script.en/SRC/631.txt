<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA022_072)I feel kinda dizzy...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA022_073)I can't believe he kept us up all 
night tellin' those stories...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA022_074)Well I was fascinated by his epic 
tale of the girl who fought with 
a frying pan and a ladle!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA022_075)...<STR>(EST_P), it sounds like you 
want to hear even more stories.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA022_076)Yeah, well you can count me out...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA022_077)Anyway, this is quite impressive for 
something that's just an illusion.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA022_078)It's so weird... It's an illusion, 
but we can talk with people, 
and everything feels so real...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA022_079)Perhaps it's because these 
things really did exist 
at one point in the past.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA022_080)Humans could never give up blastia 
completely... Which has brought 
us to where we are today...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA022_081)The empire was only meant to 
monitor the blastia, but they started 
digging them up and studying them.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA022_082)The Entelexeia despised 
the blastia, but humans 
just can't let them go.
