I, I lost...

## POINTER 1

This competition doesn't really 
mean anything, anyway.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
That's right. It doesn't 
matter to the customers, 
either.

## POINTER 3
Mimi
I feel so pathetic...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
But you know, it's 
not like we're here 
every day working.

## POINTER 5

Right. They're really just 
here to help out when we 
need it. Nothing else.

## POINTER 6
Mimi
But...we can't both be working for 
you at the same time, can we?

## POINTER 7

That's not a problem. We've had more 
customers recently, so we have a bit 
more money to spare for extra staff.

## POINTER 8
Mimi
So you mean I can work here?

## POINTER 9

Right. From now on, 
you'll be working 
together with them.

## POINTER 10
Mimi
I understand. I'll 
do my best!<PAGE>I'm sorry. I guess I got a little 
prideful back there. I hope 
you won't hold it against me.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
Don't worry about it, missy! I 
can't wait ta work next ta a pretty 
little thing like yerself!

## POINTER 12
Mimi
Heh, is that all you've got? Come back 
when you can give me a real challenge.
