<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(KAR), what are you doing? 
Let's hurry up and go.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Y-yeah...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
..........

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Waaaaaaaaahhhhhh...!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Get away! Don't touch me! Stay back!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(KAR), <STR>(KAR), it's okay! 
It already flew away.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
...Huh? Ha, ha ha ha, it did...
Alright, let's keep moving.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
...Captain <STR>(KAR) seems a little 
different than usual, doesn't he?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
You think? He seems like his usual 
spaced-out kid self to me.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
No, something's different about him. The <STR>(KAR) I 
knew before would've been peeing his pants or running 
for his life if something like that happened.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh...now that you mention it, I think you're right.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
Wah! Bugs, a giant swarm of them! Watch out!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Waah, stay away, stay away...!!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
Blech! Hey!
Wh-wh-what 
did you do that for...
Agh, 
my eyes...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
I was just giving you a little something 
to keep away the giant swarms of bugs!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
Ah, I don't believe it..

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
*Hack* *cough* ...I thought I was gonna die!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(KAR)...
You're really afraid 
of bugs, aren't you?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Wh-who, me? N-not at all...!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
It's okay, <STR>(KAR). You 
don't have to pretend.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Here, take this. Aspio-brand insect spray, 
the best to keep the bugs away!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
Oh, uh...y-you don't mind...?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
Not at all. Just make sure not to spray 
it near any people. It can sting!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RAV)
So I'm not a person anymore, 
am I... Yeesh...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
Come on, let's go.
