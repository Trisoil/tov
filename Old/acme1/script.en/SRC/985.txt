So there are monsters
down here too...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST)
....Monsters...
That's what these things are...?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
You've never seen one before...?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST)
Uh, umm...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
...Well, let's hurry up
and take care of this,
shall we?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST)
<STR>(YUR), they're coming
from the front, too...!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Ugh...this is annoying.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
...That should take care of it.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST)
I didn't know what
to do when they all
attack at once...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
You generally have to defeat
each monster one by one, but
sometimes they come in groups.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST)
Really?
We should be careful
when we go ahead.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
You can take on a monster
one at a time, or take them
on in a group. Your choice.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST)
<STR>(YUR), which way do you
think we should go?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Whichever. Let's
just get out of here.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST)
Ah, wait...
Wait for me.

## POINTER 15
