What are you 
all up to?

## POINTER 1
Nobis
...Eh? Well, if it isn't 
Brave Vesperia!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, Nobis... It looks like you're doing 
well. We were worried about you.

## POINTER 3
Nobis
Yes, as you can see, I've 
made a complete recovery.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
That's good. What have 
you been doing with 
these mages here?

## POINTER 5
Yu
I made a weapon from the everlight 
that you got for me.<PAGE>Now I've been trying to get these mages 
to apply a formula to it for me.

## POINTER 6

I'm really looking forward 
to working with everlight!<PAGE>As far as metals go, everlight has an amazingly 
high level of aer conductance.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Aer conductance...that's how easily 
something can carry aer, right?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Right. Formulas used on weapons with a high 
level of aer conductance have stronger effects, 
and make for more powerful attacks.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Aer...conductance?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
It's a measure of how easily something carries aer.<PAGE>You know how you use your 
bag to attack enemies?<PAGE>Formulas used on weapons with a high level 
of aer conductance have stronger effects, 
and make for more powerful attacks.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
So that's why enemies 
get weaker when I hit 
them with my bag...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Right, same with my belt.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Hmmm...I should take better 
care of my bag...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
You sure don't know very much 
about your own possessions...

## POINTER 15

We're going to try to apply the spirit 
formula that we've recently developed.<PAGE>By our calculations, when the stored energy is 
released as magic, it will be several times 
more powerful than magic produced from aer.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
A technique for combining a sword with magic...very clever.

## POINTER 17
Nobis
Yes...
Well then, 
if you're ready...

## POINTER 18

Yes, of course...

## POINTER 19

...It's finished!

## POINTER 20
Nobis
Ohh... It's giving off a 
fantastic level of power!<PAGE>Truly, the light of the Soul Smiths 
has been restored to this blade!<PAGE>Now I have to find someone 
to use the blade...

## POINTER 21

If you do, we'd also like to record 
exactly how much of an effect the spirit 
magic is having on the weapon.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Oh yeah? I think I know just 
the person for the job.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
...You mean me?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
Don't you think that weapon 
would suit you pretty well?<PAGE>And you'd be able to record accurate data, too. 
There's no one better suited to take it.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
That's true, but...

## POINTER 26
Nobis
I'd be quite comfortable with you using it.

## POINTER 27

...I guess we don't have any choice. If 
the client himself is suggesting it, 
we'll have to let the weirdo have it.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RIT)
This is...

## POINTER 29

You can tell it's quite powerful
just by holding it, can't you?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(EST_P)
...We would love the chance 
to use this weapon.

## POINTER 31
Nobis
Certainly. I'd love if you could use 
it in battle, all the while helping to 
promote our guild and our services.<PAGE>Then perhaps the name of the Soul Smiths will once 
again begin to be known across the world, and skilled 
artisans will seek us out to join our ranks!

## POINTER 32
<STR>(YUR)
This way, it works well for both of us.

## POINTER 33
Nobis
Yes.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(EST_P)
It looks like you've taken a liking to it.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(RIT)
...Let's go.
