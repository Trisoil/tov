Awww, I can't believe we 
have to travel with you.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
What, you ain't happy?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Well, I'm not exactly jumping for joy.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
You're too glum. Lighten up!<PAGE>Didn't I stand together with 
you in the face of evil?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
That was only because you had 
to. I still haven't forgotten 
what you did at Nor Harbor.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
You still remember that? Some people 
just don't know when to give up...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
I'm not about to make a list of all your offenses.<PAGE>Saying that I'd rather not have 
your company on our trip is already 
more than enough.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Don't worry, don't worry. I'll 
be on my best behavior!<PAGE>I behaved myself at 
Keiv Moc, and at Ghasfarost, 
didn't I?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, that sure would be nice.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
What should worry you more is whether or 
not these ol' bones will be able to keep 
up with you young'uns for much longer.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
You plan on sticking with us until 
<STR>(EST_P) goes back to the castle?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
The Don ordered me to keep an 
eye on the girl. I ain't got 
much choice in the matter.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Sounds like 
a tough job.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
I wonder if I could hand her over to 
the Imperial Knights somewhere...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
I can see it in your eyes, old man...
you're thinking bad thoughts again.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
Nah, not at all!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Well, it's really too bad that you're going to be travelling 
with us, but might as well make the best of it.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
Whaddaya mean "really too 
bad?" Hmm, well, whatever.<PAGE>Anyway, <STR>(RAV) the Great is going back to the inn. Later, boy.
