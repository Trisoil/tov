Hey, wasn't there an injured 
person in this room earlier?

## POINTER 1

Ah, are you friends 
of Nobis 
Celestia?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
He was actually a sort of 
business partner to us.

## POINTER 3

He was here until 
recently, but has 
disappeared...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
I thought his condition was bad enough 
that he wasn't supposed to move.

## POINTER 5

Yes, that's right. Nonetheless, 
he just got up suddenly 
and walked out.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
What the hell is that 
guy thinking?

## POINTER 7

If you happen to see him, would you 
mind bringing him back here for me?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, we'll make sure to give him a couple 
more lumps before we send him your way.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
What have I said about hitting 
injured people, <STR>(YUR)?
