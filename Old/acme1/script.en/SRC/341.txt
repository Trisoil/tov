I have nothing left 
to say to you.

...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
You're not going to follow him?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
What's the point? He's 
not gonna talk to me.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
So this was a complete waste of time?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Well, I wouldn't 
go that far.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Apatheia...?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
When the aer krene went berserk, 
Regaey--I mean, Yeager--was 
carrying this box.<PAGE>This box was what messed 
up my magic...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
You think the apatheia is what's causing 
the aer krene to go out of control?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Judging from the evidence, it 
could be a valid hypothesis.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
So when the blastia in Heliord was 
going out of control...you think 
there was apatheia nearby?<PAGE>And the aer krene 
in Keiv Moc, 
too...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
There may have been.<PAGE>Otherwise, maybe the apatheia's 
been damaging the whole world's 
aer krene little by little,<PAGE>and a large distortion just 
happened to appear then.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
...I see.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
It's really nothing more than a 
guess, but it could be right.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
You don't sound very sure of yourself.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
In science, you continually make hypotheses, 
then test them, and you get closer and closer 
to the truth. That's how it is.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Hmph...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
...Well, okay. Maybe I can do 
something with this after all.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
What are you going to do now?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
The next step after a hypothesis is testing it!
