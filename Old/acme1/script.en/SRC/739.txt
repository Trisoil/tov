How's it going? Any progress?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Each page is a little different, but it 
looks like he's just using a cipher to shift 
all of the characters in the text.<PAGE>It just takes time to figure 
out the cipher...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
What sort of things 
is the book about?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
...At first, I thought that Hermes 
was an average mage who was using 
his knowledge for evil...<PAGE>But he wasn't. He was an upright mage who had dreams 
about the potential of blastia and aer, and he was just 
innocently going wherever his curiosity led him..

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
...So what is it that's 
troubling you?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
There are so many interesting things 
written in Hermes' notes.<PAGE>There are plenty of formulas for magic 
I've never heard of, for example.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
So Hermes was a genius...even 
compared to you?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
It hurts a little to admit it, but yes.<PAGE>I was shocked to see that he wrote down so many 
ideas and observations I'd never hadâ€¦<PAGE>And it seems he wrote down a formula 
in this book to destroy blastia 
that had gone out of control...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
......!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
Hermes fully understood the possibility 
of the amount of aer on 
the planet increasing.<PAGE>He understood the dangers of 
the blastia he had created.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
Hmmm... Yes, I see.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
Yes. That's why he was studying magic to destroy 
the blastia in case that happened.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
...If a type of magic like that exists, 
I think that you should use it!<PAGE>No matter who or how, Hermes 
was looking for someone who could 
use that magic for good.<PAGE>He was looking for someone to take 
over his work for him. That's 
why he left behind these notes.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Wouldn't the best person to continue 
Hermes' work be his own daughter?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
Oh? But what if that daughter 
doesn't know how to use magic?<PAGE>Or maybe...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
......
Or 
maybe...?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
We'll never get anywhere if we 
keep talking in hypotheticals.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
Well, yes...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
Even if it's something that was 
thought up to destroy blastia...<PAGE>...You could put it to some other 
use. Don't you think so?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
W-well, that's true, but...<PAGE>...You're right. I don't think that 
any other mage besides me could 
ever use this formula properly.<PAGE>Perhaps I'll take it, after all...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(JUD)
Heh heh. I'm sure Hermes would be very happy, too.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
You're just saying that...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
No, I'm saying it because 
I really think it's true!
