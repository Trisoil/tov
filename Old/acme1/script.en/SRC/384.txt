## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
Ya do realize what going 
to the enemy's compound 
means, right?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
We're gonna be on their 
turf, playin' by their rules.<PAGE>If we get there and we're not ready to 
roll, they could give us a mighty beatdown 
and it'd be lights out for us...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
So, you're asking if we're 
totally prepared to go?

Not yet

<STR>(YUR)
You're worrying more than 
usual. We're ready.
