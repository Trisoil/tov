Hello!

## POINTER 1
Nobis
Hey, it's Brave Vesperia!
Thanks for your help the
other time.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
So, what happened
to the Everlight after
that?

## POINTER 3
Nobis
I haven't heard
a thing since then...<PAGE>On that note, do you think
I can ask you to gather some
information for me again?

## POINTER 4
Nobis
A fiery soul into a sea of flames.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
It's you...!

## POINTER 6
Nobis
Hello there.
I apologize for not staying in touch.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Why would you? All we did 
was deliver a package.

## POINTER 8
Nobis
Ah, that's a good point.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
We heard from Yu that there's something 
you'd like to have done?

## POINTER 10
Nobis
Really? Oh, I would 
be so grateful..

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
Thank goodness for friends, right?

## POINTER 12
Nobis
Actually...I have a job for 
you, if you're interested.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
A job? Huh? 
For us?

## POINTER 14
Nobis
I've actually heard your guild mentioned 
here and there recently.<PAGE>I thought you could 
probably find the 
answer I seek.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
So you want 
to hire Brave 
Vesperia?

## POINTER 16
Nobis
Yes, that's right. I'd actually 
like you to go gather information 
about a certain something.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Gather information? Sounds like another 
job that just keeps going and going...

## POINTER 18
Nobis
Well, I tried to do it myself, and I've 
also asked whatever guilds would help...<PAGE>So far though, there haven't 
been any promising leads...<PAGE>However...I cannot afford to be dissuaded. 
I must obtain what I seek at any cost.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
This sounds pretty...serious.

## POINTER 20
Nobis
Yes. For me it is a matter 
of great importance.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
Great importance, huh...? So what 
is it you're looking for?

## POINTER 22
Nobis
An ore of the metal known as Everlight.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
...But that's...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
The girl who asked for our help 
back in Dahngrest...her necklace 
was made of Everlight.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
She did say something about her dad 
digging it up in a mine somewhere.

## POINTER 26
Nobis
Really...?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
Yes. We might be able to get 
more information if we asked 
her a few questions.

## POINTER 28
Nobis
Splendid. You will of 
course be paid well for 
useful information.<PAGE>Allow me to explain.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
You really need this Everlight... 
What are you going 
to use it for?

## POINTER 30
Nobis
A dream I would give my life for...

## POINTER 31
<STR>(KAR)
...A dream you'd...give your life for...

## POINTER 32
Nobis
Sorry, I shouldn't bore 
you with personal matters.
Will you do this for me?

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
Give us just a minute, would you?<PAGE>Can we really accept a job without 
asking the Union first?

## POINTER 34
<STR>(KAR)
The Union doesn't keep 
other guilds from doing 
their own work.<PAGE>The Union system for getting jobs 
is just to help out guilds that 
couldn't get work on their own.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(JUD)
So we just 
moved up as 
a guild.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(KAR)
Exactly. And this way, there's 
no finder's fee, so we get 
all the money ourselves!

## POINTER 37
<STR>(YUR)
Ah, I see... All right...

## POINTER 38
Accept job?
Yes
No

## POINTER 39
<STR>(YUR)
Well, guess we'd better see if
we can't get this thing done.

## POINTER 40
Nobis
Oh, really?

## POINTER 41
<STR>(KAR)
We couldn't possibly refuse to help with 
something that's so important to you!<PAGE>We accept this task in the name 
of the brightest star in the 
night sky--Brave Vesperia.

## POINTER 42
Nobis
Thank you. I'm counting on you.<PAGE>I'll be waiting here in this 
town for a while in case 
you find some good news.

## POINTER 43
<STR>(YUR)
Sorry, but we have
matters we need to
attend to.

## POINTER 44
Nobis
I see...
You are a well-reputed
guild afterall.<PAGE>But if you find some free time, will you
come back and listen to what I have to say?

## POINTER 45
<STR>(YUR)
Sure thing.
