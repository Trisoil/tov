Woof!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? Is this aer?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
...It appears so. Aer is flowing 
through this pipe.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Ain't it dangerous getting' 
so close to it?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
This aer isn't very 
thick. It's safe.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
But why is aer 
flowing through 
the Heracles?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
It seems that aer is what's making 
this giant contraption work.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
It's being supplied with aer, without 
the need for aer krene...wow...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
The Sorcerer's Ring 
is glowing...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
I saw it do the same thing 
back in Ghasfarost.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, we were together when that happened.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
Let me see that.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Aww, I've always wanted to 
hold hands with you, <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
It's being affected by the aer. The 
interior geometry is changing.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Try pointing it 
at this gate.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
...It really seems a lot more 
powerful than it was before.<PAGE>Are you sure that's okay?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
If it can destroy everything it shoots, 
that would definitely be dangerous.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
That was a reaction between the aer inside 
the gate and the aer that the ring shot.<PAGE>It won't destroy anything and 
everything. You can relax.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
Let's use the Sorcerer's 
Ring to destroy that 
gate, too.
