Good timing. I could use 
your help right now.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
What happened?!

## POINTER 2

There was a landslide. They 
were bringing down building 
materials for town...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
It looks like you're short on 
help. Can we lend a hand?

## POINTER 4

That would be great.<PAGE>We're running low on water...would 
you mind going and bringing 
some from the watering hole?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Hey old man, <STR>(KAR), did you hear that?

## POINTER 6

Some of the injured are still back 
where the landslide happened.<PAGE>The Imperial Knights have gone out to rescue 
them, but I'm sure they're short on hands. 
If you could somehow help them...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(JUD_P), take Ba'ul.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Okay, you go 
too, <STR>(RAP).

## POINTER 10

You two can go and buy supplies.<PAGE>Go get the materials in the Imperial 
Knights' facility and take them to the 
shop to synthesize into medicine.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Gotcha. Let's 
go, <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Doctor, I've used my healing 
artes on the people outside. 
How are things in here?

## POINTER 13

Almost everyone here's been healed, too. 
But there are more people on the way.<PAGE>For now, take care 
of those people.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
Okay...!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
...It looks like things have calmed down here.

## POINTER 16

Everyone outside wasn't wounded 
too badly, so we sent them home 
after they were healed.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm so glad no 
one was hurt 
too badly.

## POINTER 18

You've gotten quite good at the motions 
and techniques involved in healing.<PAGE>I'd say you're well on your way 
to becoming a fine healer!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
U-ummm...
About that...

## POINTER 20

Eh? What is it, young lady?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
I don't want to 
become a healer! 
I'm sorry!!

## POINTER 22

I see...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
I think that healing others like 
a doctor does is an amazing 
thing to do. I really do.<PAGE>But my dreams lie 
somewhere else...

## POINTER 24

I see, I see...
It appears I jumped to conclusions.
I'm the one who should be sorry.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
Not at all...
It was my fault for
not telling you sooner...<PAGE>I'm so sorry.

## POINTER 26

No, no. Don't worry about it.<PAGE>Besides, whatever you want to 
be eventually, you already make 
a remarkable co-medical.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(EST_P)
A...co-medical?

## POINTER 28

It's someone who's neither a doctor nor a 
healer, but who helps doctors to treat the 
injured and the sick in a number of ways.<PAGE>Allow me to give you this, as a testament to your abilities.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(EST_P)
A nurse's cap...

## POINTER 30

You possess the
special gift of healing,
young lady.<PAGE>If you come across someone who is 
in pain, you must use this gift 
to help them, however you can.<PAGE>Even if you're not officially a healer, 
healing the pain of others is one of the 
finest things you can do in this world.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, it is!

## POINTER 32

Good luck in pursuing 
those dreams of yours.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(EST_P)
Thank you.
