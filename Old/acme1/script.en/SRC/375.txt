...Oh, <STR>(YUR)...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
What's the matter? You look 
more serious than usual.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah... I was just thinking 
about how hard it is to put 
a guild together...<PAGE>I thought things might 
go okay since I was with 
you guys, but...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
...Have you lost faith in your 
ability to lead the guild?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
No, not at all! I'm working 
as hard as I can...!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
All right, then I'll borrow 
from your attitude and do 
the best I can, too!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
...Hey, <STR>(YUR). Can I 
ask you something?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Is it true that you...that you 
killed Ragou and Cumore?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
It's true.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
How could you keep that from me...?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
I kept meaning 
to tell you.<PAGE>I'm sorry.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Even though I think it's 
bad...you don't regret 
killing them, do you?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I don't.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
...I just don't 
know...<PAGE><STR>(FRE) and <STR>(EST_P) were trying to 
bring them to justice, too...<PAGE>Did you really have 
to kill them?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
I think there are some things 
that you have to do, even 
if they're a crime.<PAGE>Someone has to do them, even 
if it means taking the blame.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Maybe so, but even still...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
I just did what 
had to be done.<PAGE>You shouldn't force yourself to try to accept what I did.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah.
