## POINTER 0

Excuse me, Miss <STR>(RIT), I have 
another message from my boss.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Ah, finally. What does 
she need this time?

## POINTER 2

Yes ma'am. This time she's asked 
for two things: ○○○○ and ○○○○.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Ah, yes...
She could certainly 
put ○○○○ to good use...

## POINTER 4

As usual, the items should be brought 
to the Capua Torim office.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Of course! I'll take them both to the office 
as soon as I manage to acquire them.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Taken out of context, that conversation 
would sound pretty shady...
