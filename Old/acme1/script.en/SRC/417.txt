Halt! This area is currently 
under the control of the 
Imperial Knights!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
The Royal Guard... This is 
the Commandant's private 
force of elite knights.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
What are the Commandant's forces 
doing in a forest like this 
with hoplon blastia?

## POINTER 3

I have no reason to answer your questions. 
And civilian activity is restricted 
by law in this area.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm, be that as it may, 
why are you pointing that 
weapon at us like that?

## POINTER 5

Bring it on!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Man, that escalated 
quickly.<PAGE>Well, we're off 
to a good start.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
So the mysterious group of people 
was the Imperial Knights...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
But why did he 
attack us?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
Maybe because they're doing something here 
that they don't want anyone to know about?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
You mean...with that blastia?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Maybe, yeah.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Watch out...!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(EST_P)...!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
...What did you just do?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Same as what she did in Heliord...!<PAGE><STR>(EST_P)'s power took the aer 
and made it dissipate!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
You've got to stop doing crazy things like that...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm, I'm sorry! I just thought about 
how everyone was in danger, and before 
I knew it my power...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
Her power is starting to unconsciously 
respond to her feelings...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
That last attack came from that blastia. 
It was aiming straight at us.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(JUD)
Which means that <STR>(EST_P) will 
end up using her power every 
time we're shot at.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
...But then...what 
should I do...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Hey hey, you saved 
us, didn't you?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, if that had hit us head on, 
we would've been goners for sure!<PAGE>We should be mad at the fact that they 
shot at us, not that <STR>(EST_P) protected us!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
We've sworn to settle <STR>(EST_P)'s 
problems along with the world's 
problems.<PAGE>Everything we're doing right now is 
towards that purpose. We shouldn't 
let the details get in our way.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RAV)
But won't Phaeroh get mad if she 
keeps doin' stuff like this?<PAGE>Whether it's by a blastia or by Phaeroh, 
I don't wanna be barbecued alive!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
Come on, this is simple. We 
just have to do something about 
that blastia, right?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
That's right.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RIT)
Let's pummel the jerks who are 
controlling that blastia!

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
All right, let's go. Try 
to keep a low profile.
