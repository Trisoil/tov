## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Having trouble sleeping?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)

Mmm? Not exactly...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Once we beat the Adephagos, 
I guess we'll all end up 
going our separate ways.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Will you go back to the 
castle when that happens?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
Yeah, I'll 
have to.<PAGE>...Will you go back to Aspio?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
Well then, I guess I'll 
have to go visit you 
from time to time!<PAGE>...What are you going to do?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Help with the reconstruction 
of Aspio, I suppose.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
Well then, I'll 
go and help, too!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
A princess can't exactly go wandering 
around doing whatever she wants.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, I forgot...<PAGE>...Will you still be my friend 
after I go back to the castle?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(EST_P), you'll forget all about 
me as soon as you go back.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
No, I won't!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Even if His Dumbness becomes the 
emperor somehow, you won't exactly 
have your hands free.<PAGE>Running a kingdom is a lot of work. You won't 
be able to just do whatever you want.<PAGE>You'll have new stuff coming up day 
in and day out, and you'll be up to 
your neck in people's problems.<PAGE>And in the meantime, all of those memories you 
have of me will be thrown to the farthest reaches 
of your memory, like sand on the wind...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
B-but...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
...I'll go and visit you.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
What...?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
I said, I'll 
go and visit 
you!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RIT)...!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
Don't misunderstand me. 
It's not because I'll 
be lonely or anything.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
I understand. ...<STR>(RIT), 
you're a good person!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
Will you cut that out? I'm not 
anything like a good person!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
All good people deny being 
good. Just like that.<PAGE>Only good people act 
like bad ones. Like 
you, for example...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
You could really say that about a lot 
of people in our party, couldn't you?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
Ah ha ha, come to think of it, everyone's 
like that, aren't they?<PAGE>...Do you mind if I ask again?<PAGE>...Will you always 
be my friend?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
So long as you don't 
forget about me.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(EST_P)
I won't!

## POINTER 27
<STR>(EST_P)
We'll be friends forever, then.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RIT)
Forever?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(EST_P)
Forever and eeeever!

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
Oh boy... That sounds like a long time...
