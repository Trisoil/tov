Next up is the eggbear claw.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Are we going to walk around the 
woods and look for an eggbear?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
No, we'll never find one that way.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah? What'll we do then?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Hand me a nia fruit, would 
you? I'm going to use it to 
lure out the eggbear.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
The eggbear has 
very unusual tastes, 
you see.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAP)
...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Jeez, you smell 
horrible!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
ME? The smell isn't coming from me!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Please tell us when you're going to do something like that.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, no! <STR>(RAP)!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Everyone keep a lookout! An eggbear 
could come out anytime now.<PAGE>And they're famous for their 
terrible ferocity.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
So then, Captain <STR>(KAR), I'm assuming that you're going 
to lead the charge against this terribly ferocious monster?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Of course! But I could use 
a hand from you, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
I'll help too. Oh, 
and <STR>(RAP) also.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Well then, how about 
we have a bit of a walk 
around the forest?
