<STR>(EST_P)
Master, so you were 
here in Aurnion!

## POINTER 1
Drake
Yes...But I regret 
that I must set out 
again quite soon.<PAGE>I've been waiting here 
so that I could speak 
with you, <STR>(YUR) Lowell.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Huh, me?

## POINTER 3
Drake
I would like you to return to the Imperial Knights, 
and provide support for Commandant <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Support for <STR>(FRE)? Return to the 
Knights? You gotta be kidding me.

## POINTER 5
Drake
I've always thought that the Imperial 
Knights let a very precious 
asset go when they lost you.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Master Drake, flatter me all you like, 
but it's not going to change my mind.

## POINTER 7
Drake
It's not flattery; I'm being 
sincere. What do you say?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
I'm sorry, but even 
if you offered to make 
me Commandant...

## POINTER 9
Drake
Of course, you'd be starting off as 
an apprentice, but with your abilities, 
you'd make captain in no time.<PAGE>...Take this armor!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
I don't want it!

## POINTER 11
Drake
With <STR>(FRE) as Commandant, 
the Knights will change 
for the better.<PAGE>...Still, you are not interested?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
With that stuffy spoilsport 
as Commandant? 
No thanks!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, <STR>(YUR)! Master, please accept 
my apology on <STR>(YUR)'s behalf!

## POINTER 14
Drake
......

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Commandant <STR>(FRE), huh...I can't say
it doesn't have a nice ring to it...
