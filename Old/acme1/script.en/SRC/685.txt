Shel?

## POINTER 1
Shel
<STR>(YUR)! My brother 
has returned!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? What?

## POINTER 3
Shel
Like I said, my brother Clay is back... 
But I'm sorry, I really have to go!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
So they finally found Clay! We 
weren't very helpful at all.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
But Shel seemed to be in such 
a good mood. I'm happy for him.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
Maybe we should go meet 
the long-lost brother?

## POINTER 7
Shel
Waaahhh...!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
It's you...!

## POINTER 9

Looks like fate has 
brought us together 
again, <STR>(YUR) Lowell.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
Who is this?!

## POINTER 11
Shel
My...brother... Why would you...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Y-your brother? You 
mean this man is...!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
So you're Clay?

## POINTER 14
Clay
Why did you do it? That's 
what I want to know.<PAGE>Why did you kill my master, Lune's father?

## POINTER 15
Shel
B-but...I thought if 
he were gone...you, 
Lune, and I could...

## POINTER 16
Clay
Is that what Lune wanted?

## POINTER 17
Shel
I just wanted...the 
three of us...<PAGE>My brother...Lune and I were...we were 
waiting for you this whole time...

## POINTER 18
Lune
Aaaahhhh!

## POINTER 19
Lune
Shel! Shel!

## POINTER 20
Lune
What happened to you...Clay! 
Do you realize what 
you've done?!<PAGE>How could you do that to Shel?! My father 
didn't teach you to use a sword so 
you could do something like this!

## POINTER 21
Clay
I had to see that justice 
was done...I couldn't 
overlook what Shel did.

## POINTER 22
Lune
Your justice was more important 
than Shel's life?!

## POINTER 23
Clay
......

## POINTER 24
Lune
So stupid...

## POINTER 25
Lune
I'm so stupid...I 
should have 
told Shel...<PAGE>He was always there for me...I should 
have told him "thank you"...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
Clay! Are you happy 
with all of this?

## POINTER 27
Clay
I don't know...I don't 
even know what justice 
is anymore.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Then why did you 
attack Shel?

## POINTER 29
Clay
I told you...it's who I am.<PAGE>If I hadn't brought him to justice, it would make 
everything I've been until now a lie. I'd be brought 
down to the level of the villains I hate.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
But you already 
knew, didn't you?<PAGE>That's why you didn't go back to her. You'd gotten 
your hands dirty in the pursuit of your "justice", 
and you felt you were no longer worthy of her.

## POINTER 31
Clay
It is as you say. I dirtied 
these once innocent hands 
for the sake of justice...<PAGE>I even cut down the people I wanted to 
protect, all in the name of justice...

## POINTER 32
<STR>(YUR)
If your resolve is that weak, 
you shouldn't throw the word 
"justice" around so lightly!

## POINTER 33
Clay
...Huh?

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
Anyone who learns to use 
a sword should know...<PAGE>Swords should be used to protect others!<PAGE>Once it's clear to you what's 
worth protecting, your resolve 
won't waver ever again!

## POINTER 35
Clay
What's worth protecting...

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
What is it you wanted 
to protect?

## POINTER 37
Clay
Swords should be used to protect 
others... That was the first thing 
I ever learned from my teacher.<PAGE>I wonder where I ended up forgetting that.

## POINTER 38
Clay
Your resolve never wavers, does it?

## POINTER 39
<STR>(YUR)
I'm just lucky enough to have 
a lot that's worth protecting.

## POINTER 40
Clay
...Hey, I owe you one. 
Take this. Consider it my 
way of saying thank you.<PAGE>Maybe it'll help you protect 
what's important to you.

## POINTER 41
<STR>(YUR)
What are you going to do?

## POINTER 42
Clay
I can't take back what I've done.
But I won't run away. I'm going 
to go atone for my sins.

## POINTER 43
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)...

## POINTER 44
<STR>(YUR)
How are things going over there?

## POINTER 45
<STR>(RAV)
We left the rest to the 
knights. What about Clay?

## POINTER 46
<STR>(YUR)
He went into the castle. I think 
he plans to turn himself in.

## POINTER 47
<STR>(JUD)
Good. Things should work 
themselves out, then.

## POINTER 48
<STR>(KAR)
Why did this have to happen...

## POINTER 49
<STR>(YUR)
Don't cry, <STR>(KAR). 
We've still got 
a lot to do.
