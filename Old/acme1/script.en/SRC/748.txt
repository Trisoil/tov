From the look on your face, I'd guess that 
you've brought back all five books.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Yep, every single one!

## POINTER 2
Miska
All right! Then without further ado, shall 
we get started with the written test?<PAGE>You may refer to the books that 
you brought to answer all of 
the questions that follow.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
How hard can it be to ace a 
test where you can look up 
all the answers in books?

too, <STR>(KAR). Who knows--you might 
surprise yourself and pass.

Th-the Nam Certificate?

## POINTER 9
Miska
Yes. It's a test for kids around 
age ten. It's one of our 
most popular attractions!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
Oho, aren't ya scared ya might 
fail? A test like this could 
be tough for a kid like you.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Don't insult me! I'm already twelve years 
old! That's a full two years above the age 
level for the test. It should be a cinch!

## POINTER 12
Miska
If that's what you've decided, then both 
of you, get ready to take the test.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, don't distract me 
or anything, okay? This 
isn't a game, you know!

## POINTER 37

Heh heh, I guess.

## POINTER 39
Miska
Sorry to keep you waiting! I would like 
to present the results of your tests!

## POINTER 40
Miska
First, Miss <STR>(RIT) Mordio. 
Out of a possible 800 
points, you received...<PAGE>800 points!
You passed with 
a perfect score!

## POINTER 41
<STR>(EST_P)
Wow, <STR>(RIT)! You're amazing!

## POINTER 42
<STR>(RAV)
When it comes down ta it, ya can get things done, kid.

## POINTER 43
<STR>(RIT)
I'm actually quite relieved... 
Only one other person has

## POINTER 44
<STR>(JUD)
So then, that makes you the second
person in the world to pass it, <STR>(RIT)!

## POINTER 45
<STR>(KAR)
You guys!

## POINTER 46
<STR>(KAR)
I still haven't gotten my results yet!

## POINTER 47
Miska
Next, we have <STR>(KAR) Capel. 
Out of a possible 100 
points, you received...<PAGE>82 points!
You just barely 
passed!

## POINTER 48
<STR>(KAR)
I did it! I did it!! 
Yeesssss! I passed, 
I passed!

## POINTER 49
<STR>(KAR)
Eh? Why isn't everyone 
else celebrating?

## POINTER 50
<STR>(RAV)
Well...they're questions written fer 
a ten-year-old. A twelve-year-old
passin' them just isn't too impressive.

## POINTER 51
<STR>(RIT)
It would've been pretty 
shameful if you'd failed.

## POINTER 52
<STR>(KAR)
C-come on...

## POINTER 53
Miska
Now, to bestow the honored titles 
onto the successful test-takers!

## POINTER 54

you happy, <STR>(RIT)?

## POINTER 58
<STR>(RIT)
Uh...y-yes, of course. 
I'm happy...

## POINTER 59
<STR>(RAV)
You're cryin'! Overwhelmed by 
emotion! Reduced ta tears! 
Salty, salty tears of joy!

## POINTER 60
<STR>(RIT)
S-stop saying such ridiculous things! There 
was just something in my eye, that's all!

## POINTER 61
<STR>(JUD)
Heh heh. Suuure, <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 62
Miska
Now then, next off, 
we have a title for 
<STR>(KAR), as well.

## POINTER 63
<STR>(KAR)
F-for me? 
Really?!

## POINTER 64
Information
<STR>(KAR) obtained the title,
"Little Shrimp Professor".

## POINTER 65
<STR>(KAR)
L-little shrimp! I thought I was 
getting the Nam Certificate!

## POINTER 66
Miska
The Nam Certificate has various levels, and 
you're at the lowest of those levels. If you 
get a higher score, you'll go up in rank.

## POINTER 67
<STR>(RAV)
Hoo boy! Little shrimp professor! 
A fittin' title, if I do say so myself.

## POINTER 68
<STR>(RIT)
A good title...for a ten-year-old.

## POINTER 69
<STR>(KAR)
Oh no...oh no! Ack, I don't want 
it! I can't have a title like 
that! You can have it back!

## POINTER 70
Information
<STR>(KAR) gracefully declined the
"Little Shrimp Professor" title.

## POINTER 71
Miska
I think it's a perfectly good title...<PAGE>Anyway, Miss <STR>(RIT) Mordio, 
congratulations.

## POINTER 72
<STR>(RIT)
Ah, yeah, thanks.

## POINTER 73
Miska
Keep up your research so as 
to not soil the honor that 
you have earned today. âˆ€

## POINTER 74
<STR>(RIT)
Leave it to me. This 
genius mage has yet 
begun to shine!

## POINTER 75
<STR>(RAV)
So, how'd it go?

## POINTER 76
<STR>(RIT)
Terrible... Thanks to this 
little bozo, I couldn't 
concentrate at all.

## POINTER 77
<STR>(KAR)
Whaaaaat?! It's not my fault 
if you didn't do well!

## POINTER 78
<STR>(RIT)
What do you mean it's not your 
fault? You were the one groaning 
in despair the entire time!

## POINTER 79
<STR>(KAR)
Th-that was just me 
thinking out loud...

## POINTER 80

the results of your tests!

## POINTER 81

Miss <STR>(RIT) Mordio, out of a possible 
800 points, you received...<PAGE>715 points!

You passed!!

## POINTER 82
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, not half bad.

## POINTER 83
<STR>(RIT)
Hmph. I would've done better if 
not for that little squirt.

## POINTER 84
<STR>(RAV)
Nah, doin' that well even with all 
that distraction...that's quite 
a feat. Genius mage, indeed.

## POINTER 85

What about me? 
What about me?

## POINTER 86
Miska
Ah, yes. Next we have <STR>(KAR) 
Capel. Out of a possible 100 
points, you received...<PAGE>66 points!
Unfortunately, you didn't 
pass. Better luck next time.

## POINTER 87
<STR>(KAR)
Oh no! It can't 
be true!! This is 
a joke, right?

## POINTER 88
Miska
No, no. Sorry, you just 
didn't pass. You didn't 
have enough points.

## POINTER 89
<STR>(RAV)
*Whistles* A 12-year-old failin' 
a test with problems written fer 
a 10-year-old! It's a new low!

## POINTER 90
<STR>(EST_P)
Well, you were just having an 
off day today! Right, <STR>(KAR)?

## POINTER 91
<STR>(KAR)
I, I...
I don't...

## POINTER 92
<STR>(YUR)
Don't cry, <STR>(KAR). We all flub 
up every now and then.

## POINTER 93
Miska
Every cloud has a silver lining. 
Let this failure inspire you 
to try harder in the future.<PAGE>So then, a glorious title for 
the successful test-taker.

<STR>(RIT)
I'm just so happy to 
know that I was right 
to believe in myself!

## POINTER 98
<STR>(JUD)
You wouldn't be the <STR>(RIT) we know without 
that self-confidence of yours!

## POINTER 99
<STR>(EST_P)
Congratulations, <STR>(RIT)!
