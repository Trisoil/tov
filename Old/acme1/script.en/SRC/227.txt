It looks like we can't go any higher, 
and we can't go outside, either.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
What 's the matter?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
My spear is gone.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Things might be
difficult without
a weapon...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
What the? Is the Sorcerer's 
Ring broken?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Did the aer here do this?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
Hey, you're more fashion-conscious than I thought!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
This isn't 
fashion...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
You go like this, and...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
It moved.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)

levers with that, too.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
You think it's okay? 
I'm afraid it might blow 
up or something.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)

let's pull that lever over there.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
If something this tiny exploded I guess 
it wouldn't be too dangerous...
