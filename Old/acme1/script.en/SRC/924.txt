## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
What...?!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(FRE)
No... I was just thinking how poorly 
that knight's armor suits you.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Like I care what you think.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(FRE)
No, I mean... I'm starting to think you quit the Knights 
just because of how ridiculous you look in armor.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I quit! So?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(FRE)
And yet you seem to be pretty happy 
to wear the armor around right now.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
I just decided to wear it on a whim.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(FRE)
So are you going to join 
the Knights again?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Why should I?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(FRE)
Oh? You can't 
do that on 
a whim too?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
There's not even a one in a million chance 
of me ever having that sort of whim.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(FRE)
Oh? Too bad.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
It's not "too bad" at all!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(FRE)
Oh yeah?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, it's not...
Anyway, 
I'm going.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(FRE)
It's really too bad, but 
I guess the free life suits 
you better, <STR>(YUR)...
