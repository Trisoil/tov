Hello!

## POINTER 1
Yu
Ahh...if it isn't my faithful delivery guild...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
This may be a bit abrupt, but 
are you with the Soul Smiths?

## POINTER 3
Yu
Soul Smiths? Oh, you mean the blacksmith guild. 
No, I'm afraid I have nothing to do with them.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
...Um, <STR>(RAV)...?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
That book these guys delivered for ya...<PAGE>That's no ordinary book, now, is it? There 
were guild codes written in there.

## POINTER 6
Yu
You mean you looked inside 
it?! And wait. You 
can read codes?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Guild codes used to be a way 
for the guilds to communicate 
with each other in secret.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Huh. Pretty clever.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
And the Soul Smiths're about 
the only guild still usin' 
'em at this point.

## POINTER 10
Yu
"Dealing in weapons...carefully" 
has always been our guild's motto.<PAGE>Those who make the best weapons 
must always be neutral.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
...So then, you are 
one of the Smiths?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
Which would make that Nobis 
who picked the book 
up a member as well.

## POINTER 13
Yu
...It would seem 
the jig is, as 
they say, "up."

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Leviathan's Claw wants to 
get in touch with you.

## POINTER 15
Yu
Oh, do they...<PAGE>Our boss never had much 
stomach for Yeager's 
unpredictability...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Ah, then...

## POINTER 17
Yu
But...I hear that man is dead now.
Perhaps change is on the wind.<PAGE>It would at least be worth 
making contact with them.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Whoa, we've gotta get that written down! 
They'll want some sort of proof we actually 
met one of the Soul Smiths.

## POINTER 19
Yu
...If I must, I suppose.

## POINTER 20
Yu
Here you are.<PAGE>This signature represents the will of my guild. When coupled 
with our guild's reputation, it should be sufficient.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
Then we should be getting 
back to the Fallen Manor.
