What about the apatheia!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
If you've got enough spare time to be hanging 
around those idiots, you'd be better off 
using it to think of another plan.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Another plan...
It's not that easy...

## POINTER 3
Harry
...Here.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Are you...giving this to us?

## POINTER 5
Harry
No, this is going to be stolen.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
What do you mean?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
...I owe you one.

## POINTER 8
Harry
Get a move on before the 
others realize it's gone.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Ta what do we owe this generosity?

## POINTER 10
Harry
I dunno. Maybe it just left a 
bad feeling in my stomach to get 
lectured by a kid like that.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
Maybe there's some hope for that boy after all.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
So now that we've gotten the 
apatheia, what's next?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Next up, we're going to the Zopheir Rift.<PAGE>I'm going to use the inactivated 
aer krene that's there.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
The Rift? We're going someplace cold 
again? Mind if ol' <STR>(RAV) waits here?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
You'd rather be cold than have the world 
be destroyed, wouldn't you? Let's go.
