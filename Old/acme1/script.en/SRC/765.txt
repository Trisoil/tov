How strange...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
What's the matter?

## POINTER 2

The shaggothim flowers are only supposed 
to open during the rainy season, and yet, 
look! They're already in full bloom!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
That sounds pretty weird...

## POINTER 4

I know, right? I wonder if someone's 
been coming here and watering 
the ground, or something...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
Would just that be enough to 
make these flowers bloom?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Another cause for flowers blooming early 
could be an imbalance in the aer.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
So you're sayin' that this place...?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
It's okay. Even if my guess is right, 
this level of aer imbalance can 
occasionally be found in nature.<PAGE>Plants are simply more sensitive to 
changes in the surrounding aer than 
humans, and they're reacting to that.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
We wouldn't wanna have what happened 
in Heliord happenin' here...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
......

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
What the... <STR>(JUD_P)...?

## POINTER 12

Waaah! The warehouse's 
aero blastia is...!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
I can't believe that dragon freak would 
do this again...! I'm going to go see...!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, <STR>(RIT)...!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Dragon freak, huh...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
What's all this commotion about?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? It wasn't 
you?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
I plead the 
fifth.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
......

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
It was terrible... There was 
nothing left for me to fix.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
I'm sorry for your...loss.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
Urgh... The next time I see that freak, 
I'm going to punch him into the stratosphere!! 
Stupid dragon freak!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RAV)
Whoa, scary.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
I don't know what you're 
trying to do, but...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(JUD)
It's not causing any of 
you any trouble, is it?<PAGE>I already told you.<PAGE>I'm not going to do anything that 
would cause any of you harm.
