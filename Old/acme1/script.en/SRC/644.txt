Hello there. Mind if I ask 
who your connection is?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
What, we can't buy things from 
you without an introduction?

## POINTER 2

I'm afraid not. I'm not 
quite like the other 
merchants, you see.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
You mean you're different from 
the people in Fortune's Market?

## POINTER 4

Yes, yes, most correct. I 
am Mercedes Dunkel, black 
marketeer extraordinaire.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Black marketeer?

## POINTER 6

A salesman for Leviathan's Claw. 
I travel the wide world, selling my 
weapons wherever I set up shop.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Leviathan's Claw... So you're 
one of Yeager's henchmen...?!

## POINTER 8

Ah hah hah. Henchman has such 
a villainous ring to it.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
What sort of things 
do you have in stock?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Jeez, <STR>(JUD). Go ahead 
and make friends, 
why don't ya.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
I beg your pardon, but when did knowing 
one's enemy become a bad thing?

## POINTER 12

Hah hah, I suppose I could show such 
an honest young lady my wares. I 
can't sell you anything, though.

## POINTER 13

Here. This is a hoplon blastia 
that can spray a target with 
flames up to 100 meters away.<PAGE>It's actually an antique from quite 
a ways back, but I've kept it in 
top shape so it still works fine.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Hey...this. There's a 
name written on it...

## POINTER 15

Yeah, must belong to whoever 
dug it out of the ground.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, those guys from Ruins' Gate in 
the Shaikos Ruins were writing their 
names on the stuff they'd found.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
What's worse, this thing's got 
that idiot's name on it, too.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RAV)
Oopsie... Looks like that's solid proof 
of a connection between the two...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
You know something 
don't you, old man?!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RAV)
Well, the Don's got this little hunch 
ya see, that Yeager and Regaey 
are one and the same person.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
No way. You don't really think 
they're both one guy...?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RAV)
That doesn't change the fact that 
Leviathan's Claw and Ruins' Gate're 
two different guilds, though.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
But imperial law forbids the 
trafficking of blastia.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAV)
That's got nothin' ta do with the Union.<PAGE>Fortune's Market's about the only 
guild that follows the Empire's laws. 
Business and all, ya' see...

## POINTER 25

...Oh, well now. 
You're Brave Vesperia, 
aren't you?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
We have been making a bit of a 
name for ourselves, I guess.

## POINTER 27

A man in black, a princess-like young 
lady, a mage, a man from the Union, a 
young boy, a femme fatale, and a dog.<PAGE>I received word from Yeager to treat you 
with extreme caution should we meet.<PAGE>And with that I'll be bringing our little 
business engagement to a close.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(JUD)
What do you think, should 
we get rid of him?

## POINTER 29

H-hold on, now, do you enjoy threatening 
poor, defenseless merchants?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(JUD)
Oh stop, you have all these 
weapons don't you?

## POINTER 31

These blastia are my inventory. I can't 
just use them whenever I like.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(RIT)
He's not worth the trouble. Taking 
care of this guy won't put a stop 
to their blastia smuggling.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(RAV)
Well, if it gets ta be a problem for 
the Union, they'll be sure ta lay down 
the law. Ya know, like with Barbos.

## POINTER 34

Just like the man says. So if it's 
all right with you, I'm going to get 
back to earning a living, here.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(RIT)
I am seriously looking into 
this whole Ruins' Gate thing 
when I get back to Aspio.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
Depending on Yeager's next move, 
we might be forced into action 
ourselves, before too long.
