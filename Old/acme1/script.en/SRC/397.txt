## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS37_003)These are human 
footprints, right? There 
sure are a lot of them.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS37_004)Could it be the Hunting Blades?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS37_005)That, or it might be the Knights.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS37_006)But why would the Knights be here?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS37_007)<STR>(FRE) was looking for apatheia 
too. If that's what the Hunting 
Blades are doing here...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_008)Then the Knights could be 
here for the same reason.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS37_009)Why is everyone scrambling 
to get their hands on 
apatheia all of a sudden?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS37_010)We never had the 
chance to get an 
explanation from the Don...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS37_011)If <STR>(JUD_P)'ll clue us in on what she 
knows, things might clear up.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS37_012)Hey! You guys, come look at 
this! Th-this is crazy!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS37_013)What the heck is 
this? The mountain's 
been...flattened.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS37_014)What could have happened...?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS37_015)Is there really supposed 
to be a town here...?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS37_016)Well, it was here ten years 
ago, that I'm sure of.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_017)But I can't vouch for what's 
happened since then.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS37_018)Ten years? That's quite 
a ways back. What were you 
doing way out here?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS37_019)Uh, well...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS37_020)That voice... Is that you, Freak?!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS37_021)Here's hopin' everything's 
all right.
