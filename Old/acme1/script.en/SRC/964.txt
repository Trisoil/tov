Undine...!

## POINTER 1
Undine
Salutations.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
What's the matter? What is it?

## POINTER 3
Undine
This large contraption has 
caught my interest...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
An elemental spirit, interested in blastia?

## POINTER 5
Undine
Is it strange?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
No. You used 
to be Belius, 
after all.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
I feel like it makes sense you'd be 
interested in something like this.

## POINTER 8
Undine
I'm contemplating using 
my power to move it.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
Wha... What?! You can't do that...!

## POINTER 10
Undine
Don't you think it would provide viable 
proof of the effects of the powers 
of elemental spirits over blastia?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
No, that would be...

## POINTER 12
Undine
I shall return...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Hah... She does whatever she wants, I see.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
You're laughing?! Aren't 
you going to stop her...?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
It's a little late for that.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
It's started to move...?
