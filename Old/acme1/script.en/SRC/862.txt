Hey, it looks like things have calmed 
down a bit for Palestralle.

## POINTER 1
Natz
Whenever I see your 
faces, I can't help 
but remember Belius.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I still feel bad about that...

## POINTER 3
Natz
No, don't. I've got more good 
memories than bad ones.<PAGE>Like when I first met 
her, or when I joined 
Palestralle.<PAGE>I remember it like it was yesterday...

## POINTER 4
Natz
I'd been traveling on a solo journey around 
the world. The night that I first saw 
her, a full moon hung in the sky.<PAGE>I shivered with anticipation. It 
was a monster I've never seen before! 
If I beat it, I'd be famous!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Y-you're saying that you 
challenged Belius?

## POINTER 6
Natz
Well, I was pretty foolhardy back then. And much 
to my surprise, I got my butt handed to me.<PAGE>When I came to, I was in the 
Coliseum, lying on a bed.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
You fought Belius and lived...that's 
pretty impressive in and of itself.

## POINTER 8
Natz
No...I wasn't even in the 
same league as Belius.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Ahh, so she let you live?

## POINTER 10
Natz
When I asked her why she spared 
my life, she told me this:<PAGE>"There's nothing to be gained by making 
a short life even shorter."

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
...That sounds like something only 
an age-old Entelexeia could say.

## POINTER 12
Natz
I'm sure she's seen thousands of humans 
come and go in her lifetime.<PAGE>Even if they became her friends, or her subordinates, 
she'd eventually outlive all of them. I can't 
even imagine how lonely that must be.<PAGE>But when she passed away, 
she was finally freed from 
that terrible loneliness.<PAGE>That's why I think...that what happened wasn't such a bad thing at all.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm...maybe you're right.

## POINTER 14
Natz
Oops, sorry if I got off on a tangent there. 
I never know when to stop talking.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
No, I don't mind at all. I 
feel like I understand Belius 
a little better now.
