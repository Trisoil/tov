It seems like it should 
be around here...<PAGE>Oh! Here it is, here it is! It's "The Legend 
that Sleeps in Searing Sands!"

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Well, well! This book belongs 
to the inn, doesn't it?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Yep.

## POINTER 3

Is there something you wanted?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Well, it's about this book 
in this shelf here...

## POINTER 5

Oh that?<PAGE>That shelf is full of books that guests have accidentally
left in the inn when they've stayed here.<PAGE>To be honest, we don't have any use for them at all, 
and guests hardly ever come back for their books...<PAGE>You can feel free to do whatever you'd like
with any of the books in that shelf.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
So you mean, you don't mind 
if we take one of them?

## POINTER 7

No, go right ahead! In fact, that shelf fills 
up pretty quickly. We've just been throwing 
away the books whenever it gets full.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
All right, we'll take 
it, then. Thank you!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
All right, so you've finally 
gotten all of them?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Yep. I've collected 
all five.<PAGE>Now I can go and 
take that test.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Going out to look for books all across 
the world...what a crazy test!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Oh, the real test has yet to begin.<PAGE>There'll be a written test that requires 
using these books as reference material.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Agh, just thinking about taking 
tests makes my head hurt.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Wouldn't you like to give it a 
try? Just to see how you do.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, I wouldn't have a chance. I don't care 
about that what's-his-face degree anyway.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah, giving something like that to you
would be like casting pearls before swine.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, who're you calling swine?!
