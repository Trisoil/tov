hands full with the monsters 
that managed to escape.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS34_004)Yeah, but it's too quiet. 
Especially compared to the 
checkpoints back at Cados.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS34_005)I think <STR>(RAV)'s got it right. 
The Knights are up to 
something, and I don't like it.

things I want to ask that guy...
