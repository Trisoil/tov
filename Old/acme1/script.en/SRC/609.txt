So, you're back. 
How'd it go?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
We took him down, check it out!

## POINTER 2
Dyne
That confirms it. Nice work, kid.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Is this guy 
your client?

## POINTER 4
Dyne
Yeah, that's him. I just don't get it. He really 
had it in for that monster. Not that he ever 
had a snowball's chance in hell of winning.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
He must have really 
wanted that Everlight 
badly...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
What is it about Everlight that would make 
him risk winding up like this? Not that he's 
in a position to tell us at the moment.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
I thought it was a guild rule 
not to go poking around in a 
client's personal business.<PAGE>I'd be lying if I said I wasn't 
curious myself, though.<PAGE>At least he ended up getting what he 
wanted. Hopefully this means his days 
of being a nutcase are behind him.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
And how are you feeling?

## POINTER 9
Dyne
Me? I'm fit as a fiddle again. Afraid I can't 
say the same for my buddies yet, though.<PAGE>You really saved our butts this time. Hope this 
shows you guys how much we appreciate it.

## POINTER 10
Dyne
I'll look after mister 
reckless here, myself.<PAGE>Thanks again, <STR>(KAR). You've really 
learned a thing or two.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Take care of yourself, Dyne.
