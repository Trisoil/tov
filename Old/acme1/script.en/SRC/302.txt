What'll you do while 
we're away?

I was thinking of going around 
and buying some tools for the 
maintenance of the ship.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
You're not expecting us to 
pay for that, are you?

## POINTER 3
Tokunaga
Don't worry. Madam President Kaufman is paying 
for all of the ship's maintenance costs.<PAGE>I'd like to get a new ceres 
blastia as well, but it's 
so expensive...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Yep, very true. That's due to the 
Empire's supervision of its sales.

## POINTER 5
Tokunaga
Therefore, it's possible 
I may not be here when 
you come back.<PAGE>If that's the case, please wait 
for me to return, would you?

Sure thing!
