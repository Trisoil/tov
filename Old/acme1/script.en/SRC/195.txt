So <STR>(EST_P)'s going back home, huh.

You don't have a problem with this, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
It's not my decision to make.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Well...I guess that's true, but...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
More importantly, where are we?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
This is the city of Heliord. Geographically 
speaking, it's located between Torim Harbor 
and the city of Dahngrest.<PAGE>It was only just recently built. 
It's still a very new town.<PAGE>If you follow this road to the east you'll hit Caer 
Bocram, where we were earlier. Cut through the west 
and go to the northwest to reach Dahngrest.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
I see...well, maybe I'll have 
a look around the town a bit.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
...I've got my own business 
to attend to.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Hmmm, what to do...
