It's my grandson's favorite food, you see. 
He's working in the Imperial Knights right 
now, so I don't get to see him very much...<PAGE>He's right around the same age as you, young man. 
I wish I could give my grandson a taste of his grandma's 
home cooking, which I'm sure he's missing...<PAGE>Oh, I'm sorry... I must sound so selfish. 
But please take it, if you'd like.
