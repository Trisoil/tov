rather quick.

Yep, here you go! Now, show us the synthesis 
workshop, like you promised!

## POINTER 3
Kaufman
...I'd be glad to take you...but 
only you, <STR>(RIT).<PAGE>The others will have to 
wait outside. I'm sorry.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Really? But we wanted 
to see it too!

## POINTER 5
Kaufman
Sorry. These are pretty high-level corporate 
secrets we're talking about.<PAGE>Please don't think too harshly of me for saying 
so, but we can't just show it to anyone.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
Ah, you might be 
interested...<PAGE>It seems they should be able to synthesize 
a lot more types of items soon!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Because of the ○○○○ 
we gave them?

Oops! That's covered 
by the NDA as well.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Ah, sorry, sorry.

## POINTER 13
Kaufman
Our production process still has room for
improvement, so we might ask for your assistance again in the future.<PAGE>Just to give you the heads up.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Sure, of course! I'd love to get another 
look at the synthesis workshop, too...
