Good day!

## POINTER 1

Ah, are you going to the Weasand of Cados?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Yes, we are. Why do you ask?

## POINTER 3

The Imperial Knights have sealed 
off passage through Cados.<PAGE>It's not just here--they've set up blockades 
at all of the routes through the mountains.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Blockades...? Why 
would they...

## POINTER 5

I don't know all the details, but 
I heard that it has something to do 
with some danger in Nordopolica.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
What should we do... We 
need to get to Nordopolica 
before the new moon!

## POINTER 7

I wish I could help, but they 
wouldn't even let me through, 
and I have a travel permit.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Are you a member 
of the Fortune's Market?

## POINTER 9

Yes.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
How'd you get 
your permit?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
The empire issues travel permits to Fortune's Market 
so that its members can travel wherever they want...at
least, that's how it's supposed to be...

## POINTER 12

Right, but the Imperial Knights 
wouldn't let me go any further.<PAGE>I'm going back to Mantaic, since there's 
no way to get around them.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Do you think <STR>(FRE) ordered 
the blockades?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm, I couldn't say.<PAGE>Either way, we can't 
afford to be stuck here 
for much longer.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
Yes, it'll be a lot of trouble 
if we miss the new moon.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
But I don't think they'd 
let us through, even if 
we asked nicely.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
Well, to be honest, we can go take a look and 
think about how to get in... The hard part 
will only come once we've gotten inside.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
What do you mean, "once 
we've gotten inside?"

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
They set up blockades to make it hard 
to get outta the mountains...gettin' 
inside shouldn't be nearly as tough.<PAGE>I think that much 
is safe to assume.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Well then, should we go back to Mantaic 
to do some final preparations?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
No, we're fine. Let's 
go like we are.
