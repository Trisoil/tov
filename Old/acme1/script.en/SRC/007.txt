## POINTER 0
Kozakura
A type of item you will most
likely be synthesizing often
are weapons.<PAGE>This is because there are lots
of skills attached to weapons.<PAGE>Old weapons are often needed
as raw material for synthesizing
new weapons.<PAGE>I suggest you don’t discard
or sell any weapons that
come your way.<PAGE>On the other hand, old armor
is not necessary in synthesizing
new armor.<PAGE>It is better to sell old armor first
when short on Gald.

## POINTER 2
Kozakura
Do you see the section titled, ”Sub”
under the Equip. menu?<PAGE>In addition to main weapons,
each character can also equip
a sub weapon.<PAGE>For instance, <STR>(YUR) can equip gloves
and <STR>(RAP) can equip collar type
items as a sub weapon.<PAGE>Sub weapons are extremely valuable
and are not sold in shops. They can
only be made through synthesizing.<PAGE>It is worthwhile to create sub
weapons. They have skills which
you will find useful in your journey.<PAGE>Also, sub weapons can affect
the character’s appearance.
Try giving them a new look!

## POINTER 3
Kozakura
You can synthesize
a new item with the
item still equipped.<PAGE>So say you equip a Wood Maul. 
You don't have to unequip it 
to create a Wood Maul + 1.<PAGE>Synthesizing can be done while
an item is still equipped, but 
raw materials will be used up.<PAGE>Before synthesizing a new weapon,
it is a good idea to check whether
you’ve finished learning a skill first.

## POINTER 4
Kozakura
Are you familiar with 
attachmentparts?<PAGE>They don't serve much purpose,
but they can alter the character’s
physical appearance.<PAGE>Attachment parts can be created
through synthesizing. Check out the
recipe if you’re interested!<PAGE>It might be fun to give your
characters a new look!

## POINTER 5
Kozakura
Are you familiar with the
“Half Damage” skill?<PAGE>This skill allows you to cut the
damage dealt to enemies by half.<PAGE>Well, you might think, ”What's
the use of that?!”<PAGE>But, it comes in handy when you
want to use Fatal Strike to finish
an enemy low in HP.<PAGE>Item drop rates and experience
increase when you finish an
enemy with Fatal Strike.<PAGE>This skill is actually more
useful than you think!

## POINTER 6
Kozakura
It seems like you can use
Over Limits.

## POINTER 7
Kozakura
Did you know that you can
use a certain item to raise
your level during an Over Limit?<PAGE>The items ”Limit Trio” and
”Limit Quartet” allow you
to do this.<PAGE>These two items can only be
obtained by synthesizing. It might
be worthwhile to remember this.

## POINTER 8
Kozakura
Have you ever noticed that there
are some exceptionally large
enemies lurking in dungeons?<PAGE>These are known as ”Giga
Monsters”. They’re a lot
stronger than normal enemies.<PAGE>They cannot be defeated
easily. Sometimes it may
be better just to run.<PAGE>Even if you do manage to defeat
them, however, they will reappear
in the same area after some time.

## POINTER 9
Kozakura
Have you heard of a skill that
changes an existing arte?<PAGE>When this skill is set, certain
artes will transform into a
different arte.<PAGE>For instance, with the ”Chain”
skill set, the arte, ”Azure Edge”
will transform to ”Azure Storm”.<PAGE>Some artes might require two
skills to be set before they change.<PAGE>Altered artes can be learned if
used repeatedly.<PAGE>Once learned, you can continue
to use the arte without having
to set the skill.<PAGE>This is something you want to
keep in mind, as it will increase
the scope of each battle.

## POINTER 10
Kozakura
Have you noticed that the weather
seems to change in certain areas
of the world?<PAGE>For instance, sometimes it is
sunny, and at other times raining
in Quoi Woods?<PAGE>It seems that some monsters
only appears under specific
weather conditions.<PAGE>These monsters may even
drop rare raw materials.<PAGE>If you’re after these monsters, it is
best to wait at a nearby inn or set
up camp until the weather changes.
