What was that?

## POINTER 1
Karen
Oh my, it looks like some of our 
things fell from the carriage.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(RAP)? What's that 
in your mouth?

## POINTER 3
Karen
Oh, that's the...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
...A medal?

## POINTER 5
Karen
That belongs to <STR>(RAP)... That 
is, the pup of the dog that 
our father's friend owned.<PAGE>That medal is the mark of a knight's 
dog. <STR>(RAP)'s mother received 
it from the Imperial Knights.<PAGE>After she died, it was 
supposed to have been 
passed on to <STR>(RAP).

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
...But no one knew 
where to find him.

## POINTER 7
Karen
Right. It ended up being 
entrusted to us, at least 
until <STR>(RAP) came back.<PAGE>It seems it was mixed 
up with our bags...

Good job, <STR>(RAP).

## POINTER 10
Karen
...Amazing...

## POINTER 11
Rich
...Take it...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Wait...isn't this 
important to you?

## POINTER 13
Rich
...He should be the 
one to have it...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 15
Karen
Yes...
There's no point 
to us holding onto 
it anymore...<PAGE>It seems your <STR>(RAP) has taken 
a liking to it, too.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
I guess it's yours then, <STR>(RAP)...
It makes you look pretty distinguished.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!
