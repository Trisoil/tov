This blastia is 
working. Why...?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
...This one is fitted with a core.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Something's written here... 
Warp blastia...?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
So in other words, someone 
used this to leave Myorzo?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
It looks that way.

## POINTER 5

Hmph.<PAGE>What could a functional 
blastia be doing here?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
It appears that someone's left the town.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(EST_P)......where's <STR>(EST_P)?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Wait, and where'd the old man go?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? You don't think...both 
of them used this?

## POINTER 10

Hmm...<PAGE>The blastia in our town should 
have all lost their cores back 
in ancient times...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
A core was probably brought 
in from outside the town.<PAGE>It should require adjustment to 
function properly, but <STR>(EST_P)'s 
an exception to the rules.<PAGE>If she can interact directly with aer, 
she might also be able to reconstruct 
aer to fit the core's formula.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
But why would she...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
Elder, could you get everyone 
to help us search to see if 
our friends are in town?

## POINTER 14

Hmph. Very well.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Let's look for them, too.
