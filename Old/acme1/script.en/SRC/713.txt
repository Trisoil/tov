I see...so the Chief and the others 
left town this morning.

## POINTER 1

I'm not sure if they left the town, but 
they did spend the night here last night,<PAGE>and I'm fairly sure that their 
leader was your Chief.

## POINTER 2

I see.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
M-mister, who was that man just now?

## POINTER 4

Oh, he said something about being a member of 
a guild called the Hunting Blades, I believe.<PAGE>It seems he got separated from the rest of his guild, though.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
D-did Nan stay here 
last night?!

## POINTER 6

Nan?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Chill out, <STR>(KAR). You can't 
expect him to know that.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
Sir, members of that guild were 
staying in this inn, correct?

## POINTER 9

Yeah, they were here until early this morning.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
W-was there a girl with brown 
hair travelling with them?

## POINTER 11

Actually, I seem to remember someone like that, 
yes... She looked like she'd be injured, somehow.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
That must be her wounds from 
fighting with us... Oh no...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
You don't know that for 
sure. Those guys get into 
fights all the time.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
Hey <STR>(YUR), ya think we might be
here fer the night?<PAGE>Looks like the kid's a mess. Some relaxation'd 
be good fer his nerves.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
You're sure it's not just that you're tired and want to rest?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
Well, there is that, too...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm...

## POINTER 18
Stay at the inn?
Yes
No

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Good idea. Let's get some rest.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RAV)
Well, you said it!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
We don't really have time to 
be lounging around in a place 
like this. Right, <STR>(KAR)?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
Y-yeah...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
You heard him, old man.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAV)
Oh, too bad...
