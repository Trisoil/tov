We've filled up our water... 
I think we're ready to go.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Right.

## POINTER 2

Stop it! Let go!

## POINTER 3

Bad boys and girls that 
break curfew must be punished 
by the magistrate!

## POINTER 4

No way, we're going 
to look for Mommy 
and Daddy...!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Leave these children to me. I'll see 
that they're properly disciplined.

## POINTER 6

Stay out of this, stranger!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Please, forgive these children.<PAGE>I will go and apologize 
in person to the magistrate 
on their behalf.

## POINTER 8

Hey...wait, aren't you...

## POINTER 9

My deepest apologies...!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Do you think that maybe...I could've 
handled that better?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, it worked, didn't it?

## POINTER 12

Thanks for saving us 
from those bad guys!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
What are your names?

## POINTER 14
Alph
My name is Alph! My 
sister's Layla.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
What happened to 
your mom and dad?

## POINTER 16
Alph
They got taken into 
the desert in the 
magistrate's big wagon!<PAGE>Someone told me they're going 
to look for Phaeroh!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
Phaeroh...!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
But what d'ya think they're plannin' 
on doin' once they find 'im?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
And using the townspeople 
to do their dirty work? 
It's despicable!

## POINTER 21
Layla
Hey...big bro, are we 
going to go look for 
Mommy and Daddy?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
No, you're not. If you 
kids go into the desert, 
you'll die for sure.

## POINTER 23
Alph
Ack!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(JUD)!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(JUD)
We'll look for your parents. You kids 
can't go out into the desert.

## POINTER 26
Alph
Really?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
I don't lie. ...You don't 
mind, do you, <STR>(KAR)?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(KAR)
Nope. Fine by me.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RIT)
You're surprisingly agreeable.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(EST_P)
His guild is guided by 
justice, after all.

## POINTER 31
Layla
Thanks, everyone!

## POINTER 32
Alph
Here, take this, 'cause you're so nice!

## POINTER 33
<STR>(KAR)
...A glass bead?

## POINTER 34
<STR>(JUD)
It's a precious gem.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(EST_P)
It's our reward for taking the job.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
Now that we've gotten paid in advance, we've 
got our work cut out for us, don't we, <STR>(KAR)?

## POINTER 37
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, you're right.

## POINTER 38
<STR>(YUR)
...But what concerns me...

## POINTER 39
<STR>(YUR)
...is that the empire is investigating Phaeroh...
