Actually, Ioder, I have 
a favor to ask you.

## POINTER 1
Ioder
Is this about the orphanage 
in Torim harbor?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes...did you happen to hear 
it from my master...?

## POINTER 3
Ioder
Indeed...he visited not long
ago, and we spoke of it.

## POINTER 4
Ioder
After some further investigation, I've received 
reports that disasters have made orphans 
of children in several other cities.<PAGE>We've discussed the problem, and it's been decided that a portion 
of the salaries of Council members and Imperial Knights will 
be given to those cities as relief money for the orphans.<PAGE>This includes the orphanage 
in Torim harbor, of course.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Have all of the Council 
and the Imperial Knights 
agreed to that?

## POINTER 6
Ioder
Only the Council members and the knights who've 
voiced their assent will be required to 
give part of their salaries to the fund.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
So you're biting the bullet and agreeing with this 
plan to make yourself look better...is that it?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
The Council and the Imperial Knights are in 
heated competition with each other, too.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
This kid is shrewder 
than he looks!

## POINTER 10
Ioder
That was never my intention, 
though it may seem 
that way to some.

## POINTER 11
Ioder
Come to think of it, <STR>(EST), 
there's something that 
I wanted to give you.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Something for me...?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
That's...the proof of vice-emperorship...the 
Blue Crystal Rod.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
The proof of vice-emperorship...? 
What's a vice-emperor?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
The vice-emperor serves as the empire's second-in-command, and has 
a level of authority very close to that of the emperor himself.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
The Blue Crystal Rod is an honored
treasure of the Imperial family,
though Dein Nomos is more so.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
But the vice-emperor is only a temporary 
position, and isn't actually 
an official appointment...

## POINTER 18
Ioder
In a time like this, we could 
really use someone else to 
help support the empire.<PAGE>I need your help, <STR>(EST). 
Will you grant me this favor?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
But...I have to continue 
travelling with all 
of my friends...<PAGE>...No, I don't have to... I want to.

## POINTER 20
Ioder
Yes, I understand.<PAGE>You wouldn't be confined to the imperial throne, but 
rather, you could travel to places all over around the 
world, and help me by advising me of what you see.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
...I don't see any reason 
not to do it.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
I'm not sure what it would involve, but 
if you can keep travelling together 
with us, it sounds good...I think?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
Then...I'd be glad to help!

## POINTER 24
Ioder
Thank you very much...!

## POINTER 25
Ioder
The Blue Crystal Rod is evil's 
bane. May it serve you 
well in your journey.
