<STR>(RIT)
Huh? No one's here...?

## POINTER 1
Kaufman
Oh, you're here? I apologize. 
We've all been so busy, with the 
world in the state it's in.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
I brought the ○○○○ 
and the ○○○○, 
as you asked.

## POINTER 3
Kaufman
Then shall we...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Leave it to me!<PAGE>You guys...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
...can wait right here. We know the drill.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Right. Well then...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
There she goes again... I wonder what 
she's doing in there, anyway.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
She's probably fiddling 
with blastia, right?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
The things they've been asking us for have 
all had to do with aer conversion devices.<PAGE>Though it wasn't hard to 
tell that, from how excited 
she's been getting.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
So you noticed, <STR>(JUD_P)? But is it really okay 
for her to be working on blastia like that?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
It seems like it's not related 
to Hermes blastia. It doesn't 
need to be destroyed.<PAGE>But their cores should still go through spirit conversion, 
in order to help us beat the Adephagos.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
That's a little 
sad...<PAGE>Even though they know they have destroy them eventually, 
they're still doing research to improve them...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(RIT) knows that, too. But she'll 
be obsessed with blastia 
until the bitter end...<PAGE>No, in her case, it's more a case 
of love than obsession, I think.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes...
That's definitely 
what <STR>(RIT) 
would say.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Anyway, it's not useless, right? 
Whatever they can synthesize will 
be useful for us in our journey.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Oh yeah...
Yeah, 
you're right.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
I'm baaack!!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, welcome back.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
You must be tired after all that work!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
???<PAGE>I thought you'd just say "you're 
late!" and grumble a little. What's 
with the warm reception?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Heh, don't worry about that. 
More important, how'd 
it go with the blastia?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
Who do you think you're talking 
to? It went perfectly, of course!<PAGE>With my help, the synthesis blastia is 
now at its full production potential...<PAGE>...W-wait, I mean, uh... Crap, 
I spilled the beans!

## POINTER 23
Kaufman
Heh, don't worry about it, <STR>(RIT).<PAGE>We won't be able to do business 
using blastia for much longer.<PAGE>As you know, we've been using blastia 
in our synthesis process.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
It was a little one that I'd never 
seen before! I couldn't help but 
want to take care of it...

## POINTER 25
Kaufman
For that synthesis blastia, and 
for everyone else, I need you all 
to work hard and do your best!<PAGE>I'm expecting big things 
from you, Brave Vesperia!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(KAR)
Okay! You can count on us!
