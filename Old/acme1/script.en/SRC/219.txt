Out of the way! The Don 
is passing through!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Is he really planning on going 
to war just to lure those 
rats out of hiding?

## POINTER 2
Don Whitehorse
We'll teach those imperial 
bastards to look down 
on us!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Oh, <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Have you finished healing the injured yet?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
How did you know that?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
The Don told me. This is from him--his way of saying thanks.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
But <STR>(YUR), things have 
gotten really bad!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I noticed.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
No, that's not what I mean.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
What else?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
I saw them!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
You saw...who?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
The Blood Alliance! Barbos 
wasn't with them, but...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(RIT) and <STR>(RAP) are shadowing 
them right now.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Just what the Don wanted...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Let's catch up with <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah.
