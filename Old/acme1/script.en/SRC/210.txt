...We're too late. This 
is so horrible.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Outta the way!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Hmm, I might be able to do something with this.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RIT), watch out! Behind you!

## POINTER 4

We won't let you fix the barrier.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
What the hell! It's just one thing 
after another! I'm sick of this!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Looks like we have those guys to thank 
for the barrier blastia failing on us.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
But why?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(FRE)
Looks like you've got your 
hands full over here.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
So, the Don's little 
lecture didn't stick?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(FRE)
I'm just doing what I can to help. How's 
the repair of the barrier blastia going?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
That'll depend on our genius mage, here.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
...The core is still there. They just fiddled 
with your formula a bit and stopped it, didn't 
they? What the...? This is...an amplifier?!<PAGE>And this formula again... The same as 
they were using back on Ehmead Hill...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
The barrier disappeared when the monsters 
attacked. It can't be a coincidence that 
they happened at the same time, can it?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(FRE)
...Probably not.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
So does your appearance here 
mean this is tied up with all 
of the empire's problems?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(FRE)
I don't know. That's why I came 
here to check things out.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
...That goes there, and 
this goes...here!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
That's our <STR>(RIT)!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(FRE)
All right, time to clean up the monsters outside the barrier! The guilds 
won't be able to complain if we fight monsters outside the city.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
We'll leave the monsters to 
<STR>(FRE). Let's go to the Union 
and ask about Barbos.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
You really trust 
<STR>(FRE), don't you?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Only because there's no one else I 
can trust. That's how I look at it.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR), I don't get 
you sometimes.
