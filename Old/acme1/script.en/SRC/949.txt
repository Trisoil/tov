Hey kid, how's it goin'?

## POINTER 1
Alph
Oh, it's you! Yay!

## POINTER 2

Thank you for saving 
our Mommy and Daddy!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Aw, shucks, kids, 'tweren't nothin'!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
What are you getting all 
bashful for, old man?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
After all, we even got a 
reward for helping them.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, what's the matter?

## POINTER 7

Hey, it's you!
Thanks so much 
for your help back there!

## POINTER 8

Thanks to you, our children have someone 
to take care of them again.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
No, really, we hardly 
did anything.

## POINTER 10

No, no, it's thanks to all of 
the precious water you shared 
with us that we're here today!

## POINTER 11

I doubt this is really enough to thank 
you for all you've done, but...

## POINTER 12

No, no, it's thanks to the precious 
water you shared with us that 
we were able to survive.

## POINTER 13

Please take this as a token of our 
thanks for saving our lives.

## POINTER 14

That's true, you hardly even 
had any water to give us...

## POINTER 15

B-but...they protected 
us from that 
monster!

## POINTER 16

Well, for a while, but then we all ended 
up getting knocked unconscious anyway...

## POINTER 17

You ungrateful... Oh, uh, 
um, thanks! Take this!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Thank you!

## POINTER 19

It's the least we could 
do. Thank you.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(JUD)
Here you go.

## POINTER 21
Alph
Huh...?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
This is important to you, right? 
You can have it back.

## POINTER 23
Alph
But...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
Don't worry, your Mom and Dad already gave 
us something to thank us for helping them.<PAGE>We couldn't take your reward, 
too! That would be greedy!

## POINTER 25
Alph
O-okay...!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(JUD)
See ya later, okay?
