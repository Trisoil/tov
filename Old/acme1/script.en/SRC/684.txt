Hey, thanks for the help back there.<PAGE>And you reproduced the move I used 
back in Nordopolica perfectly...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
I thought it'd be a good way 
to attract your attention.<PAGE>You're the man who was with those kids down 
by the lake in the afternoon, right?

## POINTER 2

Ah, so you noticed. We're two 
of a kind, you know. Maybe 
fate's brought us together.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
How do you know...

## POINTER 4

I know who you are. <STR>(YUR) Lowell, 
you're a man who's had to get 
his hands dirty, just like me.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Well, that's not fair. 
I hardly know anything 
about you.

## POINTER 6

Unfortunately, I don't think I really 
have time for us to get all chummy.<PAGE>But just for tonight, I'll 
let you ask me one question. 
Besides my name, that is.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Just tell me why...you've had 
to get your hands dirty.

## POINTER 8

Let's just say my reasons 
are not the same as yours.<PAGE>I'm looking for the man who killed my swordsmanship 
teacher. I'm just purging the world 
of a few villains in the meantime.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
You don't mind murdering people along your quest?

## POINTER 10

Just a little collateral 
damage. But it's 
who I am.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
It's who you are...?

## POINTER 12

It's fine if you don't understand. 
Maybe it's better, even.<PAGE>You can still turn back.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
What are you talking about...?

## POINTER 14

I thought I told you, you only get one question.<PAGE>Well, I'm off. I hope that our 
paths don't cross again.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I'm not too crazy about seeing you anytime soon, either.
