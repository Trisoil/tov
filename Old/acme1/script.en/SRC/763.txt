Sir <STR>(RAV), a mission 
well done!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
Mission? Whaddaya mean...?

## POINTER 2
Leblanc
Sir <STR>(RAV), word of your formidable success 
has reached our ears, even here!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Enough with the formalities.

## POINTER 4
Leblanc
Yes sir, that is, I've come with a 
gift of clothing from Master Ioder!<PAGE>This is a gift of encouragement to Sir <STR>(RAV) 
from Master Ioder. Please take it, that it 
may serve you well in the final battle.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
An outfit for the final battle, eh?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
It's given by the emperor to a distinguished 
commandant to recognize their 
loyalty and great deeds.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
He's probably trying to get you pepped up by 
giving it to you before the final battle.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
But shouldn't you be givin' 
it ta <STR>(FRE), then? I'm not one 
of the Imperial Knights!

## POINTER 9
Leblanc
Apparently, Sir <STR>(FRE) refused to take it. He said 
that you deserve it, Sir <STR>(RAV), as you will 
be the one to stand on the real battlefield.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
I think that's <STR>(FRE)'s way of saying, 
"I'll clean up for Schwann's mistakes. 
Go and give 'em hell."<PAGE>He'll be pretty steamed if you turn it down.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
...I understand. Then I'll accept 
this gladly, as an imperial 
gift from Master Ioder.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Once you accept it, you have to wear it.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
Right here?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. It's the custom.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
It suits you rather well.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
I'm glad ya like it. Now, 
let's get out of here.

## POINTER 17
Leblanc
C-Captain Schwaaannâ€¦<PAGE>Schwann Brigade! All 
salute Sir <STR>(RAV)!

## POINTER 18
Leblanc
Godspeed!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
Wow...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RAV)
That's why I wanted us 
to get out of here!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
Everyone has such high hopes for us.
