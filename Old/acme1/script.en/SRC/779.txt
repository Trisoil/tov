Woof!

## POINTER 1

Bark!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAP)
Woof woowoof!

## POINTER 3

Bark, woof!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
I wonder what they're talking about.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, me too.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
You too...
<STR>(YUR), I thought 
you understood what <STR>(RAP) 
means when he's barking?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
When did 
I ever say 
that?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Oh... That dog ran off!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
But don't you interpret 
what <STR>(RAP) says 
sometimes?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, I've just been saying whatever I 
think he might be thinking at the time.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Really? I'm not so sure.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Do I really look like 
a dog whisperer to you?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Ah, he came back!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
Hey! The puppy came 
an' brought somethin' 
fer the pup!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
What is it?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Looks like the Little Wolf's fur.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
Ah, I see what's goin' on. The pups are 
having a territory markin' competition.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Right, and with that fur, <STR>(RAP) will 
be able to use his sense of smell to 
figure out where the Little Wolf is.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
Oh, I see! That dog went and brought back 
some fur that had been left in town.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RAV)
With this, not even yer rival's 
a match fer you! Right, pup?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!
