I think so... I was too flabbergasted 
by all this weirdness 
to really notice.

## POINTER 24

Yo, give that apple 
gel back, you!

## POINTER 25

Give it back? Don't 
be so heartless, 
Flatty!

Fresh-squeezed from the udders 
of yours truly! Moo hoo hoo. ∀

Come back if you 
change your mind.

a change of heart about 
that apple gel, then?
