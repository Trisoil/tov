Doors like this never open when you want them to!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
I guess we'll have to climb over the 
wall and open it from the inside.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
A little quick to jump to our last resort, aren't you?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Let's wait for <STR>(FRE) 
to come out, then.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Even if <STR>(FRE) comes out, it's not like he's 
going to bring Mordio out with him.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
Well, if <STR>(FRE) comes outside, we can 
just ask him to let us in, can't we?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
He'd never go for a plan 
like this. He's far too 
much of a goody-goody.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(KAR), what are you doing?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
There, it's open!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Huh...? Y-you can't 
do that!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
...Your guild specializes in hunting 
monsters, right? Or are you guys into 
thieves' guild-type stuff, too?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Heh, umm, yeah... Well, I'm 
pretty much the only one who 
can do anything like this.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Well, good job! Shall we?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
No, that's bad! We should 
just wait here for <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
I don't have the patience to wait 
for <STR>(FRE) to just happen to walk 
out of this town by chance.<PAGE>It was unquestioning obedience to laws and authority 
in times like this that made me quit the Imperial 
Knights in the first place!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
But, but...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Well then, <STR>(EST_P), keep a lookout 
for us here, won't you?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
Wait, but, but, 
umm...!! I-I'm going 
with you!
