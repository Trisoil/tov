Wh-what's up? I feel kind 
of sick all of a sudden.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Even someone as dense 
as you can feel it?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Who are you calling--
Wait, does that mean 
you can feel it, too?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Ugh, what a feeling...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(YUR)...<STR>(EST_P), too?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm f-fine.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Don't overexert yourself. We can 
rest here and have a look around.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Seriously, what's going on? 
Ever since we got here...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
If a monster attacked us right now, 
I don't think I'd be up to it.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Saying stuff like that is the best 
way to attract monsters, you know.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)...!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
If you're going to keel over, couldn't you do it 
in the middle of a crowded city street? I can't be 
expected to be there to catch you every time.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Y-yes, thank you. I'm 
still doing okay.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
...This is aer.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
What? I thought aer couldn't 
be seen with the naked eye.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
If it's dense enough it can be.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(EST_P), weren't you saying something 
about that earlier?<PAGE>That dense aer is 
bad for the body.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes... "High-density aer can occasionally 
have very negative effects on 
the human body."

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
It made you pass out in 
the Quoi Woods, too.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
...Really? Wow.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Maybe we should get out of here.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
But we still haven't made sure if 
the mercenaries are here or not.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
I guess that's true, but...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
Let's keep moving.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
It looks like this blastia 
is linked to the door.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(KAR)
How do we open it?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RIT)
It seems that we have to carefully 
put together the symbols to form 
the right phrase.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Wouldn't it be faster 
to break it?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RIT)
That's not a good idea. What if 
it makes the door stop working?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
Hey...something's coming out of it.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RIT)
...So should we just put 
some letters in here?

## POINTER 32
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, didn't we pick up some 
odd pieces of paper?

## POINTER 33
<STR>(EST_P)
Actually, come to think of it...<PAGE>Could this be a clue to
the passcode?

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
Seems we need to use our 
mind to get an answer.
Let look at the paper again.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(RIT)
...So should we just put 
some letters in here?

## POINTER 36
<STR>(KAR)
What letters?

## POINTER 37
<STR>(YUR)
We need some sort of clue, or 
else this door won't open.
