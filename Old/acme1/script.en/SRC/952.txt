...So it looks like the Blood Alliance...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
...isn't here after all.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Those guys are the Hunting Blades.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Th-that man...we saw 
him in Deidon Hold.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Ah, now that you mention it, 
we did see him. So he's the 
leader of your guild, then.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
He's gonna fight that monster all by himself?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
...What? No way, man!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
He took it out in one hit...?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
That was a fatal strike.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
A fatal strike?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
It's a crazy-powerful technique that 
extremely skilled swordsmen can use.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm... So how do you do it?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
How do you do it...?
H-how should I know?!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
"Fatal strike--A strong attack which 
throws your opponent off balance..."<PAGE>"...Followed by a single, well-timed 
strike to finish the enemy."

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Is that something else 
you read in a book?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
Y-yes, it is...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
I see... It sounds like it's 
easier said than done.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
You really want to get back 
into your guild, don't you?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Wha, what makes you say that?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh...? <STR>(KAR), are you going to 
go back into the guild?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
I won't go back...! I'm sick 
and tired of monster hunting.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
Won't go back, or can't 
go back? It sounded 
like you were fired.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
N-no way. I had been 
planning on leaving 
for a while.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Mmm, is that so? Well, 
no matter, then.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
So, uh, let's get going.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
Well, I'm glad you're 
staying with us, <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
Anyway, what do you think they're 
doing with such a large contingent?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(EST_P)
Yeah, if they wanted to take out that monster 
we saw, one person would've been enough.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(KAR)
This is actually the first time I've ever seen 
this many guild members gathered in one place.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(EST_P)
Really?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, a lot of the members are loners. 
They tend not to travel in groups.<PAGE>And the Chief being here is 
out of the ordinary, too.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RIT)
Curiouser and curiouser...

## POINTER 32
<STR>(KAR)
You want to...follow them and see what they're up to?

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, that sounds interesting, 
but I'm gonna keep going.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(EST_P)
He's looking for members of the Blood 
Alliance, after all. Right, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 35
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I don't want to worry about two 
guilds. One is more than enough!
