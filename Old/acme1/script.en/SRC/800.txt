Hello! How may I help--oh, 
<STR>(YUR), it's you.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, <STR>(JUD_P)? I didn't recognize 
you at first. What do they 
have you doing here?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
I'm running the souvenir shop. They sell 
all sorts of interesting stuff here. 
Just looking around is pretty fun.<PAGE>And keep this on the down-low, 
but I'm also on the 
lookout for <STR>(RAV).

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
It looks like <STR>(EST_P) and <STR>(RIT) haven't caught 
on yet, but when I saw how he passed out last 
time, I knew exactly what was going on.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
I have to say, I'm surprised at how 
little experience <STR>(RAV) actually has.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
So you noticed, <STR>(JUD_P)...

## POINTER 6

Oh, did I?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
No, no, I'm no match for you, 
<STR>(JUD_P). Poster girl for the 
souvenir shop, indeed.<PAGE>Those clothes look 
great on you.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
Oh <STR>(YUR), you're nice and all, but 
flattery will get you nowhere.
