<VOICE>(VS44_167)What's this...?!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS44_168)The blastia's out of control!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS44_169)Looks like Zagi smashing up 
that control panel did more 
damage than we thought.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS44_170)So, so what the hell are we 
gonna do about this thing?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS44_171)Wait!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS44_172)I don't think waiting is 
going to do us any good.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS44_173)No, I think I get it! 
Look at that!!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS44_174)Ugh! What is that?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS44_175)Aer is being transferred 
at a tremendous rate.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS44_176)There can only be one place 
something this big could be 
sending that much power.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS44_177)A cannon?!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS44_178)If we were to destroy 
this blastia now...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS44_179)It might stop Heracles, but the 
cannon could go off and blow 
Zaphias clean off the map!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS44_180)No way! S-so what 
should we do?!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS44_181)Well, whatever we do, we 
have to stop this aer.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS44_182)Dein Nomos, huh?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS44_183)Oh yeah! That's what 
Duke used to get the 
aer back under control.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS44_184)Can you really do that?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS44_185)I don't really have a choice. 
Here goes nothing.
