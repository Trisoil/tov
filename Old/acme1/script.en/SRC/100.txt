Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_010)<STR>(YUR)! Where've 
you been?!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_011)I got an invitation to the castle and 
had the most marvelous time.

## POINTER 2
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_012)Of all the... And who's the young lady?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST)
<VOICE>(VS04_013)Pleased to meet you. 
I'm <STR>(EST).

## POINTER 4
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_014)The pleasure is all mine, Miss.

## POINTER 5
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_015)Er, more importantly, about those Imperial Knights.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS04_016)They've been so busy looking for you, they haven't 
paid any attention to our fiasco down here.

## POINTER 6
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_017)So you've really managed to tick them off, huh?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_018)It looks that way. Has 
<STR>(RAP) come back yet?

## POINTER 8
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_019)Sure did, and he was 
carrying some bag.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_020)What happened to it?

## POINTER 10
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_021)It should be up 
in your room.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_022)Go pick it up later. Give it 
a shake. It has a nice jingle 
to it. Mordio liked it too.

## POINTER 12
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_023)You met Mr. Mordio?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_024)Yeah, but the rat left town. 
Apparently he's someone 
important from a city called Aspio.

## POINTER 14
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_025)..."Left town?" Then that means...we've 
been hoodwinked.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_026)Afraid so. His house was empty, and 
I doubt he's even a real noble.

## POINTER 16
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_027)...I see.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_028)Looks like the aque 
blastia's finally stopped 
leaking water.

## POINTER 18
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_029)Well, without a core 
it won't budge.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_030)Is there enough water 
for the time being?

## POINTER 20
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_031)Yeah, but it won't last long.
After that, we'll just get it from 
the river. Get the runs, though.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_032)And the Knights aren't going 
to help. Guess I'll go get it 
back from the thief myself.

## POINTER 22
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_033)What? You aren't thinking 
of following Mordio beyond 
the barrier, are ya?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_034)Don't worry. 
I'll be back before 
you know it.

## POINTER 24
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_035)Humph. 
Who's worried?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS04_036)It's a good opportunity for ya. No 
need for ya to hurry back here.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_037)Huh? What do you mean by that?

## POINTER 26
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS04_038)What I mean is, we can get along 
just fine without you.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS04_039)Even <STR>(FRE) used to say, 
"I wonder how long <STR>(YUR) plans 
on living this life."

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_040)<STR>(FRE) needs to learn to mind his own business.
