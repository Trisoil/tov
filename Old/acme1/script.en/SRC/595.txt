Here now, don't, I say, don't 
interfere in our duties!

You'd better not keep 
us from keeping watch!

## POINTER 3

Pipe down, you two...!

You can always count on 
Tweedle A and B for a laugh.

## POINTER 5
Adecor
I say, what did you say?

## POINTER 6
Leblanc
Don't you have something 
better to do than stand around 
harassing public servants?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
You got it all wrong. We found some 
people helping out the extremists. 
Thought you might want to know.

## POINTER 8
Leblanc
Y-you what?!

## POINTER 9
Adecor
I say, this is of utmost importance!

## POINTER 10

Off we go, Adecor!

## POINTER 11

Halt! ...Where did 
you say they were?

## POINTER 12

Check the alley 
next to the inn.

## POINTER 13

I say, this time it's 
really important!

Here we go again!

Sorry about earlier.

## POINTER 16

Release me! I am a 
noble! How dare you 
knights...! Ugh!
