You can only disembark from the ship where 
you see a dock, a port, or a beach.<PAGE>You won't be able to get onto 
land where there are cliffs.<PAGE>Of course, the ship can't pass over rocks, but you'll also 
have to keep her out of the shallows around islands.<PAGE>You might be able to take her into some 
rivers, if they're deep enough.<PAGE>However, if there's a bridge spanning the 
river, you won't be able to take her under. 
We wouldn't want to clip off our mast!
