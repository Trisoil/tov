Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_139)Back again huh, you stubborn punk?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_140)Sorry to keep you waiting.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS21_600)Hey, the core in that sword!
Is that the core to the aque
blastia.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_601)Yeah, it's gotta be.

## POINTER 4
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_141)These fools don't know when to give 
up. Capua Nor, Dahngrest, and now 
all the way to Ghasfarost!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS21_142)I've always hated kids.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS21_143)Barbos, this has gone on long 
enough. Save what's left of 
your honor and give up!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS21_144)That's right, you're finished.

## POINTER 7
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_145)Oh, this is far from finished.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS21_146)I put 10 years into building Ghasfarost 
Spire, and while it stands, nothing 
can stop me!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS21_147)And with that man and the empire wrapped 
around my finger, I was able to build 
my magnificent blastia.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_148)You think I'm just gonna let you waste 
the lower quarter's core like this?

## POINTER 9
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_149)Oh, it won't go to waste. I'll use 
this to eliminate Whitehorse, and 
then I will be leader of the guilds.

## POINTER 10
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_150)Then the empire is next! With 
this power at my disposal, the 
very world will be mine!

## POINTER 11
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_151)And I'll start with you. Be gone, worms!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_152)That sword is gonna be a problem.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS21_153)Problem? Is that 
thing even legal?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS21_154)It is very powerful.

## POINTER 15
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_155)Gah ha ha!! The blastia 
seems to be working 
just fine!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS21_156)What...?!

## POINTER 17
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_157)What's wrong?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_158)Heh, you haven't won yet.

## POINTER 19
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_159)All right, playtime's over! Time 
to wipe Dahngrest off the map, 
and you along with it!

## POINTER 20
Duke
<VOICE>(VS21_160)Get down.

## POINTER 21
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_161)What?!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS21_162)What happened to not having 
any time or interest?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS21_163)Hey, that's...!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_164)<STR>(RIT), never mind that!

## POINTER 25
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_165)...Piece of crap!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_166)Looks like the tables have turned, Barbos.

## POINTER 27
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_167)...So all that fancy wisdom 
and the power of the blastia 
were nothing but a sham...

## POINTER 28
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_168)Should have known from the start that 
I'd have to depend on my own strength.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS21_169)Take up your swords!

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS21_170)You know, he was so much 
easier to deal with when 
he was all drunk on power.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS21_171)Yeah, there's nothing worse than 
an enlightened idiot.

## POINTER 31
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_172)I am the only man to stand as Whitehorse's 
equal in battle. Now you will know the 
power of Barbos the Stormblast...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS21_173)...and his 
Blood Alliance!

## POINTER 32
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_182)Aguh!

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_183)Your henchmen have run out on you...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS21_184)That's it, Barbos. It looks 
like you were the fool who didn't 
know when to give up.

## POINTER 34
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_185)Urk...Ha ha ha. 
Perhaps you are 
right.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS21_186)Then you'll surrender...

## POINTER 36
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_187)I...I won't be humiliated 
any more than this.

## POINTER 37
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_188)...<STR>(YUR), was it?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS21_189)You remind me of Whitehorse 
in his youth... You're his 
spitting image.

## POINTER 38
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_190)Hope you're not saying I'm gonna end 
up like that old man. Not exactly 
something to look forward to.

## POINTER 39
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_191)Like the Don, sooner or 
later you will make great 
enemies in this world.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS21_192)...And then that world 
will consume you whole.

## POINTER 40
Barbos
<VOICE>(VS21_193)Regret, sorrow, and despair will 
hound you all the way to hell, 
and I will be waiting there for you.
