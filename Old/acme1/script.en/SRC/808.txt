In the kitchen, we chefs act with fairness and

With the recent cooperation between the 
Empire and the Guilds, it's become possible 
for you to do a public competition.

that you've mastered so far, surely nothing will stand 
in the way of you becoming first-class chefs!<PAGE>Now go! Waste not a single moment! 
Your training awaits!<PAGE>I'll be waiting for you on the stage of 
glory, in Dahngrest's Cooking Coliseum!
