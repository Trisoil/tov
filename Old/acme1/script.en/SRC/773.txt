<STR>(RIT)
Argh, come on! 
Wait for me!<PAGE>All of you, wait here.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? I mean, that's fine, but...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm going to go with you!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
No, you wait here too.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
If you and <STR>(JUD) go alone, you'll 
be captured in no time!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
You should give <STR>(JUD_P) and <STR>(RIT) more 
credit than that, don't you think?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
But it would be so much easier if they didn't 
have to worry about being stopped by guards!<PAGE><STR>(JUD), wait for us!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
No, don't come with us!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Well then...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(YUR), where are you going?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, just for a walk.
