Oh, it's you. Thanks again 
for what you did for me.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)

It was nothing.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
It was a lot of work, actually.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
I was trying to be polite...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAP)
*Aggressive bark*

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Actually there's something 
we want to ask you.

## POINTER 6
Rhianna
Oh? I'd be happy to 
help, if I can.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
That necklace you asked 
us to find was made 
of Everlight, right?

## POINTER 8
Rhianna
Yes.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
You said your father mined 
the ore for the necklace and 
made it himself, right?<PAGE>Do you know where he got the ore from?

## POINTER 10
Rhianna
I read in his diary a while 
back that it came from a mountain 
in western Desier.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
Mt. Temza...?

## POINTER 12
Rhianna
Yes, that name 
sounds right.<PAGE>He wrote that he went up to the 
mountain after spending the night 
in a Krityan village there.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
Do you know when this was?

## POINTER 14
Rhianna
Before my parents got 
married, so...over 
twenty years ago.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
Twenty years ago...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
That long ago, huh...
There's no telling if there's any
Everlight left there anymore.

## POINTER 17
Rhianna
...I'm afraid I don't know anything more than that...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
That's plenty. Thanks!
