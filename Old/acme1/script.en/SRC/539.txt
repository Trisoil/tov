...So, are you telling me to go all
the way out to the countryside?

## POINTER 1

I wonder if this place is any good.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
This place is no good.
And Zaphias won't work either.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
We gotta make things
fair for everyone.

## POINTER 4
Harry
This is something important.
For the Empire and for the Guilds...

## POINTER 5

Hmph. I'm not going to be
used like some messenger.

## POINTER 6

I don't want to leave Dahngrest
at a time like this.<PAGE>It's up to you, Harry.

## POINTER 7
Harry
Alright. I guess I'll
be going.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
What? This is important!
You're just going to decide like that?!

## POINTER 9

It's alright. I'm not going
to question Harry's
decision back there.

## POINTER 10

Hmm...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
That settles it. We'll be
back at the little prince's
earliest convenience.

## POINTER 12
Harry
Okay.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Let's go back to where
<STR>(FRE) and the others are.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah. Let's head back first.
