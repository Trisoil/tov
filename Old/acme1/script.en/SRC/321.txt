Oh, where are you off to?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Nowhere in particular. Just going on a walk.<PAGE>What about you? Where 
were you going?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
I just wanted to get a look at the desert terrain 
we were going to be headed into next.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
It's good to be prepared. 
So, how was it?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
It was hot.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Well, I assumed as much.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
But... It wasn't as hot 
as I thought it'd be.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm...well, okay. But what 
I wanted to know was if Phaeroh 
is out there.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
Right...that'd 
be nice.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Oh well, I guess we couldn't 
expect him to be that 
easy to find.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
What?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
You want to go out and 
check for yourself?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
No, that's okay...<PAGE>If we head out to look for him, 
we should do it together.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, I see.
