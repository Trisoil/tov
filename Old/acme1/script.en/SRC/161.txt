So, what's the plan?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm going to go see 
Magistrate Ragou.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
What? We'll get turned away at 
the gate if we try to go there.<PAGE>Even a noblewoman like you would 
have no chance of getting in.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, but with the harbor 
barricaded, we can't cross 
over to Torim Harbor.<PAGE>And that thief Dedecchi, along with 
that one-eyed giant, are both on 
the other side of the water.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Let's stop blabbing about it 
and just go, why don't we?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
If he won't listen to what we have to 
say, we can think of another plan.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
All right, let's head to 
Ragou's palace, then!
