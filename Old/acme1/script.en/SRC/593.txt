*Gasp*
Yur-!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Shh...

## POINTER 2
Sebastian
...Thanks to the confusion caused by the 
motley crew you sent to my rescue, I was 
able to make off with quite a haul.

## POINTER 3
Mimula
Well done, Sebastian, 
my dear.<PAGE>At last...I'll teach those imperial idiots a lesson 
for daring to look down on my family...

## POINTER 4
Sebastian
You do have to give Leviathan's Claw some credit, though... 
They've really got a nice collection of weapons.

## POINTER 5
Mimula
...This should also please 
those excitable extremists.

## POINTER 6
Sebastian
With us on their side, it'll 
be a new day dawning for this 
empire... Heh, heh, heh.

## POINTER 7
Mimula
And with the coming sun, this flower of 
the nobility shall bloom once again...!<PAGE>Those grimy-faced commoners 
won't know what hit them...!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
They want to overthrow the empire...?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
You said once that the emperor 
is the one who makes their noble 
ranks official, right?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
So... If they get rid 
of the empire, she won't 
be a noble anymore.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
Perhaps she has eyes for the throne, herself.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
So? What do ya propose doin about it?<PAGE>Once hired, a guild's pretty 
much limited to doin' the job 
and collectin' a pay check.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
But do we just pretend we didn't hear 
their plans to stage a coup...?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
Not ta worry, Princess. Those 
extremists won't amount 
ta much trouble at all.<PAGE>They'll cause a bit of a panic 
if they're lucky, and then the 
Knights'll come down on 'em.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
You really think so...?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
Why not just pick up your 
reward, and skedaddle?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
Sure it's all right for a former knight 
captain to say that sort of thing?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RAV)
Hey, you're lookin' at a strict utilitarian, here.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
Well, we shouldn't waste any time 
reporting this to the Knights.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
What do you think, chief?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
I'm at a loss...
