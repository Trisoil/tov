<STR>(FRE)
I've been hearing rumors that 
you're even stronger than ever.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
It feels kind of funny hearing a 
compliment like that from you.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(FRE)
Even His Highness Ioder has been praising 
your deeds. He's been saying that he wishes 
to give you the title of free paladin.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Man, that little prince sure 
is a pain in the neck...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(FRE)
I see you haven't learned any manners in all your travels.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Tell him not to so liberal 
in handing out titles 
to someone like me.<PAGE>It's beneath his dignity as a candidate to the throne.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(FRE)
...I thought you might say 
something like that.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
You did?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(FRE)
Yes, but I have to agree 
with his desire to honor 
you for what you've done.<PAGE>Even you should be able 
to understand that, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Hah, when you put it that way, I guess I have 
to admit...I see where you're coming from.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(FRE)
So...you'll accept it?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
No... I appreciate the thought, 
but that's enough for me.<PAGE>Don't you think there's something 
wrong with me taking a title 
like that from the empire?<PAGE>I can't quite put it into 
words, but it's not right.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(FRE)
So you won't accept it, then...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah... That's the long and the 
short of it. See you later.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(FRE)...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(FRE)
Princess <STR>(EST)...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(FRE), didn't you tell me that 
it's what's in someone's heart 
that makes them a knight?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(FRE)
Huh? Yes...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
If what makes a knight is the commitment 
to justice in his heart, and his refusal 
to ignore evil deeds when he sees them...<PAGE>Then <STR>(YUR) is more of 
a knight than anyone 
else, title or not.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(FRE)
I know this. But His Highness and 
I just want to go a step further 
and acknowledge it officially.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
We can acknowledge 
it in our hearts. 
Isn't that enough?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(FRE)
Perhaps...but...<PAGE>...If you could at least give him this...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
This is an official uniform...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(FRE)
From His Highness Ioder. He asked that <STR>(YUR) 
wear it to the ordination ceremony.<PAGE>Please, at least give this to <STR>(YUR). 
As a symbol of Ioder's and my 
thanks for what he's done.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
And what if 
<STR>(YUR) refuses 
to take it?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(FRE)
Then shove it in his bags 
while he's not looking.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(EST_P)
It'll get all wrinkled like that.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(FRE)
Then that's 
<STR>(YUR)'s problem.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
Hee hee...yes. All right, 
I'll take it for you. 
Thank you, <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 29
<STR>(FRE)
A knight in the heart, eh...
