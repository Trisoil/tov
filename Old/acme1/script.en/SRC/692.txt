Is that man injured?

## POINTER 1

Back when we had that stand-off with Palestralle, 
he got crushed in the stampede of onlookers, 
and he ended up like that.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm...<PAGE>...Hey, <STR>(EST_P)...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Damn it... She always 
has to be like this...

## POINTER 4

...Leave me alone!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
...?!

## POINTER 6

You're going to heal me, and then 
I'll owe you tons of money, huh? 
That's quite a scam! Hmph!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
No, that's not true at all!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
The man wants to die, <STR>(EST_P). 
You should leave him alone.

## POINTER 9

You think I'm gonna die from a 
puny little wound like this?!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Even a little scratch can get infected. And then 
the infection can spread through your whole 
body...and then...you die. It happens a lot.

## POINTER 11

Y-you can't be serious...!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Let's go, <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Please hold still!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
It shouldn't hurt anymore.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
Sorry to keep you waiting...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
All right, let's go.
