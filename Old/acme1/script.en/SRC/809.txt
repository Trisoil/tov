I'll need to see a letter of invitation 
before I can allow you to 
enter the Cooking Coliseum.<PAGE>...Ah, the guild representatives? 
Excellent.<PAGE>Once inside, you will not be able to withdrawal 
from the match or leave until it is finished. 
Have you made all the necessary preparations?

## POINTER 1
Enter the competition?
Yes
No

## POINTER 2

Your entry has been accepted.<PAGE>I'm terribly sorry, but for sanitary reasons, 
your canine friend will unfortunately be 
unable to enter the Cooking Coliseum.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
I'm sorry, <STR>(RAP). You'll have 
to wait for us outside.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAP)
Wooo...

## POINTER 5

So, which of you will 
be competing?

## POINTER 6
Select a participant.
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(RAV)
<STR>(JUD)

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
I guess I'll do it. It should be interesting 
to fight in a battle where I don't 
have to be slicing up monsters.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
This is all you, <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Me? You don't mind?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
No, of course not. 
Good luck, <STR>(EST_P)!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
O-okay! I'll do my best!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
It looks like this is a job for the one and 
only boss in the making, Captain <STR>(KAR)!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Uhhh...all right. The reputation 
of all the Guilds is on the line.
I'll do my best!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Who better to compete than <STR>(RIT), who's
acting like she'd rather be somewhere else?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
What?! No way! Pick someone else.

## POINTER 16

Oops... I already registered 
Miss <STR>(RIT) as the competitor.<PAGE>...As per our rules, entrants' names cannot be 
changed once they're registered in the system.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
Hold on, you gotta be kidding me! But it's 
your fault for being so registration-happy!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
A representative for all the 
Guilds? Sounds like you're the 
man for the job, old man.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
A showdown against the Empire, eh? 
Could be interestin'. I'm in.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
I think you're the best cook 
out of all of us, <STR>(JUD_P).

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
Just leave it to me. We can't lose.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
You seem pretty sure of yourself.

## POINTER 23

In order to keep the judging fair, we 
will also be having one member from 
each team participate as a judge.<PAGE>Judges will be chosen during 
the battle itself.<PAGE>Now then, let me show you 
to the cooking arena.

## POINTER 24

Very well. Let me know when 
you're ready to compete.
