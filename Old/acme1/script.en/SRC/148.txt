Now, come back with 
us while you can!

## POINTER 1
Adecor
I say, we've come to courteously 
escort you back to the capital!

## POINTER 2
Boccos
And then we can clamp <STR>(YUR) 
in chains where he belongs!

## POINTER 3
Leblanc
I've been waiting for 
you, <STR>(YUR) Looowell! Don't 
you move a muscle!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Jeez, this guy never lets up, does he?

## POINTER 5
Leblanc
An old acquaintance you may be, but today I 
can overlook your transgressions no longer!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR) isn't a bad 
person. I asked him 
to go with me!

## POINTER 7
Leblanc
Argh, <STR>(YUR), you ruffian! 
You're coercing Lady 
<STR>(EST)!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
No! This is what 
I really want!<PAGE>I'll go back to the castle. Just 
leave me be for a little longer!

## POINTER 9
Leblanc
I cannot allow that! Return 
to the castle with us!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
I can't go back. Please 
understand this!

## POINTER 11
Leblanc
We have no choice. We'll 
have to apprehend the 
criminal as well...

## POINTER 12
Leblanc
Urrgh!
What a shame!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Uh, <STR>(RIT)...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
She says she's not going 
back, so get lost!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)! It's 
them again!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Damn it, I knew they 
were still after us.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
What is it this time?!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Wh-what do you mean?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
I'll explain later! 
<STR>(KAR), which way 
is Nor Harbor?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
Uh, ah, it's west! West! You 
go over Ehmead Hill and Capua 
Nor is right there.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
All right, let's go now, then.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
But, I can't...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
...Argh! Make a decision!<PAGE>Which do you really want to do? Keep 
traveling with us, or go home?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
...I'm going to keep traveling.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
A wise choice! And one that 
those knights surely wouldn't 
be able to agree with.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
Imperial Knight Point #1: "With 
this sword I shall protect the 
people," wasn't it?

## POINTER 27
Leblanc
Indeed!! Come on boys, let's show them 
what the Imperial Knights are made of!

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
...I'm sorry.
