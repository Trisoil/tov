Adecor
<VOICE>(VS02_001)<STR>(YUR)! So it is you who are the 
cause of all this commotion.

## POINTER 1
Boccos
<VOICE>(VS02_002)I know he's poor, but breaking into 
an aristocrat's house... My, my, 
how the mighty have fallen!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS02_003)Just what I needed, Tweedle A and Tweedle B.

## POINTER 3
Adecor
<VOICE>(VS02_004)I say, don't you dare call me that!

## POINTER 4
Boccos
<VOICE>(VS02_005)Just what is a Tweedle, anyway?!

## POINTER 5
Boccos
<VOICE>(VS02_006)There's no hope of escape! 
We've got you surrounded!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS02_007)Does it look like I'm trying to escape? See, it's stuff 
like that that keeps you guys from getting promoted.

## POINTER 7
Boccos
<VOICE>(VS02_008)You did not just say that!

## POINTER 8
Adecor
<VOICE>(VS02_009)I say, you take that back!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS02_010)Enough beating around the bush, I guess.

## POINTER 10
Do you need to see the tutorial?
Yes
No

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS02_011)Come on, guys, you can do better 
than that, can't you?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS02_012)Guess I underestimated these guys...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS02_013)Looks like I won't be catching up 
with that carriage anytime soon.

## POINTER 14
Cumore
<VOICE>(VS02_014)How typical of the Schwann brigade. 
They can't even manage to capture 
a single lowlife.

## POINTER 15
Adecor
<VOICE>(VS02_015)C-Captain Cumore! I say, our apologies 
for this unsightly display.

## POINTER 16
Cumore
<VOICE>(VS02_016)I'm afraid the Imperial Knights 
have no use for you lowborn scum.

## POINTER 17
Boccos
<VOICE>(VS02_017)Uhh... P-please don't 
let Sir Schwann know 
about this, Sir.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS02_018)I can't believe our taxes 
go to paying these guys...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS02_019)There he is...

## POINTER 20
Adecor
<VOICE>(VS02_020)I say, that tops it all! Abandoned 
by his faithful pooch!

## POINTER 21
Boccos
<VOICE>(VS02_021)Gah hah hah hah!

## POINTER 22
Cumore
<VOICE>(VS02_022)Well, well, you've had a busy day 
haven't you, Mr. <STR>(YUR) Lowell?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS02_023)I'm rather busy myself, but I suppose I 
can afford to play with you for a while.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS02_024)Gentlemen!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS02_025)It's rats like you that make 
<STR>(FRE)'s job so difficult.

## POINTER 24
Cumore
<VOICE>(VS02_026)<STR>(FRE)? A little suffering is just what 
that upstart lieutenant needs.

## POINTER 25
Cumore
<VOICE>(VS02_027)When you've finished with him, throw 
him in the prison as usual.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS02_028)Ten days or so ought to 
teach him a lesson.
