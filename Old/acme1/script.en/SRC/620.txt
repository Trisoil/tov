<STR>(RIT)
Man, this place is as muggy as it ever was...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
You don't like it? It's just 
about perfect if you ask me.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Now, if I were a butler, where would I hide 
a stone tablet in a place like this?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
This place is actually pretty big. Where 
are we even supposed to start...?

## POINTER 4

Oh come on, it's not like 
we're leaving empty-handed.

## POINTER 5

Still, I'm always a little bit bummed 
when we don't find any blastia.

## POINTER 6

Yes, but this may just be the clue we need to untangle 
the mystery of blastia once and for all.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
What're those two doin' here...?

## POINTER 8
Markham
Let's see, Brave 
Vesperia, was it?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
You remembered!

## POINTER 10
Markham
How could I forget the 
people who returned my 
dearest Harmfall to me?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
...Hey, what's that 
you've got there?

## POINTER 12
Markham
We dug this up deep within the ruins of the town.

## POINTER 13
Joshua
It has ancient writings on it, so 
it might just contain some important 
information about blastia.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Mind if we take a look at it?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
A black stone tablet with 
red writing... This is...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
I love it when a plan comes together. â™ª

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
...It's about time. I'd 
had it up to here with this 
cat and mouse game...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
I've actually enjoyed all 
the interesting places this 
search has taken us.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
...Do not over-water the plants early on. 
Once they have borne fruit though, take 
care not to let the soil become dry...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? What's that, <STR>(JUD)?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
They're instructions for growing 
delicious cucumbers.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
Wait... Didn't the elder 
at Myorzo say something 
about that...?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
Who cares about gardening 
at a time like this?!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
I only read what's written 
on the tablet.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
...Wait, what do you mean?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(JUD)
Um, just what I said.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
What about the process 
for refining Everlight?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(JUD)
Yes, well... There's 
nothing here about 
that at all.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RIT)
So then, this hunk of rock isn't 
the secret manual after all?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RAV)
But it's a black tablet engraved 
with red writing.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(EST_P)
It's exactly like the 
one Sebastian said 
he brought here.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(YUR)
The story must've gotten turned 
around somehow during all the 
time we were chasing him.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(RIT)
No way... Now we 
look like a bunch 
of idiots...

## POINTER 34
Joshua
You did say the process for 
Everlight refinement, right? 
Is that why you're here?

## POINTER 35
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, we came here hoping to 
find it, but it looks like we 
had our facts mixed up...

## POINTER 36
Markham
I imagine Irmine would know 
something about that.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(YUR)
Who?

## POINTER 38
Joshua
He's a famous shovel maker. He's 
been locked up in the Union's prison 
for quite a few years, though.

## POINTER 39
Markham
If there's anyone who can tell you about 
refining Everlight, he's your man.

## POINTER 40
<STR>(KAR)
Whoa, really?

## POINTER 41
Joshua
Yes. And it's no great secret that 
Irmine was the very one to make Mark's 
precious Harmfall, as well.

## POINTER 42
Markham
Or that the Harmfall itself was crafted 
entirely out of Everlight.

## POINTER 43
<STR>(EST_P)
Is that true?!

## POINTER 44
<STR>(KAR)
But what is someone like that 
doing locked up in a prison?

## POINTER 45
Markham
I'm afraid I'm not privy to the details. He never did 
strike me as the criminally-minded type, though.

## POINTER 46
<STR>(YUR)
We'll worry about that if and when we need to. Let's 
put this Everlight thing to bed once and for all.

## POINTER 47
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, you're right. That was quite a piece 
of information you gave us. Thanks a lot.

## POINTER 48
Markham
The Union's prison isn't a very fun place, 
even to visit. Take care of yourselves.
