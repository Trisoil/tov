Feel free to step inside, if 
you'd like. Aren't you cold?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
I've had enough crimes 
for today, thank you.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Meh, it's not such a big deal.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Not a big deal? "Breaking and entering is a crime punishable by

But they say people with bad 
handwriting have good hearts.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Well, I have good handwriting and 
a good heart! How about that?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(EST_P), do you know what

it a little bit. It means 
nothing to me at all.
