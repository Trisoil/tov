*Gulp* I can feel the life coming back into me...

## POINTER 1

Oh, that really hit the spot!

## POINTER 2

Thank you so much!

## POINTER 3

We're alive, thanks 
to you... You're 
our saviors!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Please, it's nothing...

## POINTER 5

*Huff* Is that...all you have?

## POINTER 6

I wish you had more...

## POINTER 7

But...thank 
you.

## POINTER 8

We've been saved, 
thanks to you.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
N-no, it's quite all right...

## POINTER 10

Wh-where's the water?

## POINTER 11

I-is this all you have?

## POINTER 12

Oh...I'm sorry... Thanks to 
you, we were saved from certain 
death in the desert.

## POINTER 13

...This is really all the water you have?

## POINTER 14

Honey, please...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
We'll have time to relax once 
we get you back alive.

## POINTER 16

I'd like to thank you for saving us...but I'm afraid I 
don't have anything with me that I could give you...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, please, we don't need 
anything like that.

## POINTER 18

No, that simply 
won't do.<PAGE>Please, come to Mantaic so that I can 
pay you back for what you've done.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
Mantaic...?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(JUD)
Wait, are you the 
parents of Alph 
and Layla?

## POINTER 21

Y-yes, yes, we are!

## POINTER 22

Did you see our children 
back in Mantaic...?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, we met them there.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
They were worried about 
their mom and dad.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(JUD)
They were even going to come out 
into the desert to look for you.

## POINTER 26

Oh... This is terrible. 
We have to go back 
to them...

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
Don't be so hasty. Do you think you 
two can go back by yourselves?

## POINTER 28

Well, we...that is... No, 
I guess...we can't.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RAV)
Then just calm down for now.

## POINTER 30

A bird...in this desert?

## POINTER 31
<STR>(KAR)
It sounds close...

## POINTER 32
<STR>(RAV)
Sounds like it came from just up ahead.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
So we'll get to meet him...it's about time. 
I was about to shrivel up in this heat.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(EST_P)
You two come, too.

## POINTER 35

Y-yes...

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
Make sure to keep a safe distance. You'll want to 
be out of the way in case a fight breaks out.

## POINTER 37

Y-yes, okay.
