<VOICE>(VS25_121)Well, if it isn't Mr. <STR>(YUR) 
Lowell. You've come 
at just the right time.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_122)Huh, I guess those wanted 
posters really do work.

## POINTER 2
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_123)Listen, I've got a job that would 
be just perfect for you.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_124)Hard labor, huh?

## POINTER 4
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_125)I like a man who can cut to the chase.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS25_126)As you may have heard, schools 
of mermen often attack cargo 
ships at this time of year.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS25_127)Huh? But I thought there was 
another guild that always served 
as your escort...

## POINTER 6
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_128)It seems the leader of the mercenary 
guild I hire passed away suddenly, 
so they aren't available.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS25_129)The other guardian guild 
simply has no backbone. 
I don't know what to do.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS25_130)What was the name of that guardian 
guild you mentioned?

## POINTER 8
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_131)The Blood Alliance.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS25_132)Gee, I wonder what could have happened to them.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_133)You're all as guilty as I am...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_134)Hate to disappoint you, but we're 
in the middle of something right 
now, so...see you around.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS25_135)Wait, <STR>(YUR)! What 
about the boat?

## POINTER 13
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_136)Hm? Did you say "boat"?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_137)We've made a guild of our own.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS25_138)We're called Brave Vesperia!

## POINTER 16
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_139)That's a wonderful name. Well 
then, shall we talk business?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS25_140)Mutual gain is one of the basics 
of all business, you know. You 
scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_141)Sorry, but like I said, we're in 
the middle of a job. We can't take 
on anything else right now.

## POINTER 18
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_142)We won't call it business, then. 
Let's just say we'll cooperate as 
two guilds helping each other out.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS25_143)That way we won't be going 
against any guild principles.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS25_144)There are various...incentives for 
getting along with me, you know.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS25_145)Um, well...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_146)All right, we can talk, but we 
need to go to Nordopolica. 
We can't afford any detours.

## POINTER 21
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_147)Fine with me. The mermen are only a 
problem in the waters near here. <PAGE><VOICE>(VS25_148)As long as I get to 
another port, I'm good.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS25_149)Once we arrive, I won't have 
any trouble making arrangements 
with another ship.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS25_150)Wow, she means business...literally.

## POINTER 23
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_151)So, do we have a deal?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS25_152)I have the sinking feeling we just 
got tricked into something.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS25_153)Fortune's Market isn't known 
as the best group of salesmen 
under the sun for nothin'.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS25_154)This isn't so bad. Now 
we have a way to cross 
over to Desier.

## POINTER 27
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_155)I'll even throw in a 
bonus for all of you.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS25_156)Bonus? What do you mean?

## POINTER 29
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_157)If we arrive safely in Nordopolica, 
I'll give you the boat we use 
to get there.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS25_158)R-really?!

## POINTER 31
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS25_159)The boat looks pretty beat 
up, but it's still a good deal.

## POINTER 32
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_160)Right?

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_161)So the these mermen must be 
pretty tough customers if you're 
willing to part with a boat.

## POINTER 34
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_162)I'll leave that to your imagination.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS25_163)I figured as much.

## POINTER 36
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS25_164)Marvelous! We have a contract then.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS25_165)Now that we've settled the details, I'd 
like you to get to work right away.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS25_166)Just let me know when you've 
made your preparations.
