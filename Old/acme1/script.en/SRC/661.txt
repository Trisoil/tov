Wow, the Krityans in this painting 
are raising their weapons 
against the Adephagos...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
That's odd. The Krityans don't seem like very
warlike people. Well, besides <STR>(JUD), that is.

## POINTER 2

Indeed, the Kritya have always 
been a peaceful race.<PAGE>We laugh and we 
cry, but seldom 
do we fight.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
So the only time that the Krityans armed 
themselves and fought was against the 
impending threat from the Adephagos?

## POINTER 4

Err, well...

## POINTER 5

It seems it's not so much a depiction of 
real life, as it is a scene that the artist 
thought would be cool to paint.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
What the... You mean, they're 
not really fighting?

## POINTER 7

Well, that was all a long time ago. But 
we do know that around that time, a 
certain type of magic was developed.<PAGE>It was a powerful arte called Astion,
and apparently it served them quite
well in the battle.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
If such an amazing type of magic exists, 
you have to teach it to us!<PAGE>I'm sure it would be useful in 
the battle we'll have to fight.

## POINTER 9

I'm sorry, but I don't know the magic. 
I wouldn't be able to teach it to you.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
...It's just letdown after 
letdown with you, isn't it?

## POINTER 11

Come now, don't be so critical. Perhaps 
this can make up for my ignorance.

## POINTER 12

This is my one and only 
Bush Baby doll.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh my gosh, it's so cute...!

## POINTER 14

Please, take good care of it.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
Of course...!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
I can't believe you...
*Sigh* 
I give up...

## POINTER 17

It's possible the knowledge of Astion is
still being passed on among our brethren who
descended down onto the planet's surface.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
You think the Krityans on the surface would know it?

## POINTER 19

Well, I don't think that all of them are as well-versed in the 
old Krityan lore as others. But someone might know of it.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(JUD)
I wonder what happened to Tort. He's guarded 
the way to Myorzo for generations. 
Perhaps he'd be able to tell us...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Well, I guess we have no choice
but to go to Aspio and ask him
in person.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
That was the man we met in Aspio, 
correct? But Aspio was already...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
That's right... 
He could have 
been...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
I think that he's still alive.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
How would you know that?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(JUD)
I just do.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
??

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
So he's alive, then. We'll ask him about 
the magic if we happen to run into him.
