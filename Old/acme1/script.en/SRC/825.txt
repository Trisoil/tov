Welcome, great to 
see you. This is 
the Poker table.

<STR>(RAV)
Well I'll be! 
They've got 
Poker, eh?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(RAV), you know what this 
"Poke-her" thing is?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
......
Young'un, this is Poker.
It's a type of card game.

## POINTER 4

Correct. In Poker, players are dealt 
from a deck of 54 cards, and compete 
to get the highest hand.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
It sounds hard...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Well, it might be difficult 
for a little shrimp 
like you, but...

## POINTER 7

No, no, not at all! I think 
you'll find it a nice, 
leisurely diversion.<PAGE>Just ask at any time if there's 
something you don't understand, 
so you needn't worry!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
So, we'll need 
chips, right?

## POINTER 9

You'll need at 
least one chip 
to play.<PAGE>However, the more chips you bet, the 
better your payout if you win!<PAGE>What do you say? Would 
you like to play?
