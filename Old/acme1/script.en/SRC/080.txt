Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_018)We've got to seal it off somehow!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS01_019)What's going on? 
Any sunken treasure 
down there?

## POINTER 2

<VOICE>(VS01_020)Yeah, but you're 
late so I'm not 
sharing.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS01_021)Hah hah. How nice.

## POINTER 4

<VOICE>(VS01_022)Hey, its sink or swim in this world.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS01_023)Looks like that blue-blooded 
mage we hired to fix the blastia 
left the job half done.

## POINTER 5
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_024)Glad you could find the 
time to stop by, <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS01_025)Take it easy with the water 
sports, old man. You're not 
getting any younger.

## POINTER 7
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_026)You're up next. Not 
afraid of a little 
water, I hope.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS01_027)Yikes.

## POINTER 9
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_028)Come on now, put your backs 
into it! Heave, ho! Heave...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS01_029)Hanks is really 
going at it.

## POINTER 11

<VOICE>(VS01_030)He feels responsible. He's the one 
who pushed the people to get the
money together for the repairs.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS01_031)And now he's the one who's all wet.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS01_032)It's not Hanks' fault 
that mage did a two-bit 
repair job though.

## POINTER 13

<VOICE>(VS01_033)That's true. He even parted 
with his wife's keepsake to 
help raise the money.

## POINTER 14
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_034)Hey, <STR>(YUR)! If you're not 
gonna help out, stand clear! 
This is dangerous!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS01_035)Hanks, did you see the blastia core anywhere? 
You know, that shiny piece in the center.

## POINTER 16
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_036)Huh? 
...Is it gone?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS01_037)Yeah. The blastia 
won't work with the 
core missing.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS01_038)That aristocrat who came to do the repairs was 
the last person to touch the blastia, right?

## POINTER 19
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_039)That's right, a Mr. Mordio.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS01_040)And he lives in the royal quarter?

## POINTER 21
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_041)Yeah, so?

## POINTER 22
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_042)Forget about that <STR>(YUR), 
give us a hand here!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS01_043)...Sorry Hanks, I just remembered 
an errand I've gotta run.

## POINTER 24
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_044)Hey, wait just a minute!

## POINTER 25
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_045)You're not seriously thinking
of going to Mr. Mordio's
place are ya?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS01_046)The royal quarter? Me? I wouldn't be 
caught dead going to a place 
like that. It gives me the creeps.

## POINTER 27
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_047)Damn it, <STR>(YUR)... Just because you can 
do a few tricks with that bodhi blastia, 
you think you're invincible.

## POINTER 28
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_048)Here's hoping he doesn't 
do anything crazy...

## POINTER 29

<VOICE>(VS01_049)He always seems to cause
problems when the lower 
quarter's involved.

## POINTER 30
Hanks
<VOICE>(VS01_050)Even the Knights have started 
keeping an eye on him...

## POINTER 31

<VOICE>(VS01_051)Well, it's just an average day for 
<STR>(YUR). I'm sure he'll be fine.
