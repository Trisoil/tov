<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS44_188)You can do it, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS44_189)Apatheia...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS44_190)It's creating interference 
with the blastia and causing 
the aer to go out of control.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS44_191)Are we gonna break it...? 
It's like one of the 
Entelexeia's souls, right?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS44_192)Fraid that's what it's down to.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS44_193)If Heracles keeps 
goin', we can kiss 
Zaphias goodbye.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS44_194)Not ta mention that cannon 
might decide ta go off.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS44_195)Yeah. We have to act now!

## POINTER 7

<VOICE>(VS44_196)Thank you.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS44_197)Huh...?

## POINTER 9

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS44_199)What about the cannon?!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS44_200)Not good! At this rate 
it's going to fire!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS44_201)No way?! We shut 
the power off!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS44_202)That's some 
friend you have.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS44_203)Hah...there he goes again. 
Showing off, as usual.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS44_204)Hey, am I the only one 
who heard a voice when 
you cut the apatheia?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS44_205)No. That might've been 
the voice of whatever 
Entelexeia it used to be.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS44_206)It was like the consciousness 
within the apatheia willed 
the aer back to normal.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS44_207)I think we're done here. 
Now we've gotta get to 
Zaphias to rescue <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS44_208)I'll call Ba'ul. We should get 
somewhere out in the open.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS44_209)We've lost too much time 
gettin' sucked into this 
Heracles decoy business.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS44_210)Let's hurry!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS44_211)Willed the aer back to normal... 
The apatheia and aer... The 
Rizomata Formula and <STR>(EST_P)...
