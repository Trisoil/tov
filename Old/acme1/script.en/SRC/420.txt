## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_082)...How does it look, <STR>(RIT)?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_083)Just like I thought, this formula 
is protected by a code as well.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_084)Think you can break it?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_085)I said I'd do it or die 
trying, didn't I?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_086)This has nothing to 
do with getting us 
to Myorzo anymore.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_087)There's no way in hell I'll let 
those idiot Knights go on using 
these poor blastia like this.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_094)I guess the rest of us'll 
stay here for now.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_095)...<STR>(YUR) himself is as laid 
back as can be, though.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS39_096)....True.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_097)Looks like it'll be a while before 
she can crack that code...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_098)Royal Guard, huh? I wonder what 
those guys were planning to do 
with the blastia anyway...

<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS39_107)Y-yeah... They're just waiting 
for us to get tired...

<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS39_118)Do you have no faith 
in me...? In us?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_119)Succeed or die 
trying, wasn't it?

## POINTER 35
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS39_120)We won't give in. 
<STR>(RIT), do what you can 
and save that blastia.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS39_121)...I will! I'll fix this thing 
if it's the last thing I do!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_122)And just so you know, 
I'm expecting the 
same from you guys!

## POINTER 37
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_123)*Sigh* ...Aw, hell. 
Guess I'll give it all 
I've got, too...

## POINTER 38
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_124)You joining the 
shining youth brigade 
or something?

## POINTER 39
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_125)Looks that way.

## POINTER 40
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_126)But man...this guy 
must practice a lot.

## POINTER 41
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_127)I'm not too worried if 
you're still making jokes.

my previous statement.

<VOICE>(VS39_132)Way to go, <STR>(RIT)!

## POINTER 47
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_133)Well, I'll be... She came through.

## POINTER 48
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS39_134)The Knights are pulling back!

## POINTER 49
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS39_135)Why? Because the blastia 
stopped? I wonder what 
they were trying to do.

## POINTER 50
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS39_136)Let's not look a gift horse in the 
mouth. Now we've kept our promise 
to Tort. <STR>(JUD), you take it from here.

## POINTER 51

That is Myorzo. Homeland 
of the Krityan people.

## POINTER 55
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS39_141)It's definitely...impressive.

## POINTER 56
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS39_142)Looks like they won't 
keep it open for us very  
long. We should hurry.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS39_143)Ba'ul!
