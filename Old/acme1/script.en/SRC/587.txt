Well now, if it isn't the Brave Pizzeria.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
It's Brave VESPERIA!

## POINTER 2

You're gonna have to forgive me. 
Never been very good with names.<PAGE>Here for more work?

## POINTER 3
Look for job?
Yes
No

## POINTER 4

Well, whenever you're in need of 
work, feel free to stop by. I 
should be able to hook you up.

## POINTER 5

So you're up to it, huh?<PAGE>Well let's see here... Oh, right. 
There is that one thing... Hmm...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
Something the matter?

## POINTER 7

Nah... It's just that this 
one's come as a direct request 
from the Union itself.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Does that mean it's a tough job?

## POINTER 9

Not necessarily.<PAGE>More likely that the client isn't 
too familiar with the way the 
Union and the guilds work.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
I wish to be put in contact 
with a certain guild.
-Mimula

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Why did the Union pass 
this job to you?

## POINTER 12

This person approached the Union 
directly about getting a hold of 
this guild they mention here.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
And the Union isn't a matchmakin' 
service for guilds and their 
potential clients.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
Then why is the job 
being posted here?

## POINTER 15

Because we're in the business of lending 
a hand to the newer guilds that can't 
find work on their own yet.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Heh, so that's what's up.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
Well, what do you think? 
Should we take the job?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
What do they mean 
by "certain guild?"

## POINTER 19

That's something only the guild that takes 
the job gets to know, I'm afraid.<PAGE>The reward is 6000 Gald. 
Will you take it?

## POINTER 20
Accept job?
Accept job
Decline offer

## POINTER 21

The client for this job isn't exactly 
nearby. Are you up to it?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
Where are they?

## POINTER 23

The imperial capital of Zaphias.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
That means...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(KAR)
This Mimula isn't 
somebody you know, 
is it <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
No...not a name I've heard before...

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RAP)
*Whine*...

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Maybe a more recent arrival...

## POINTER 29
<STR>(JUD)
We might as well have a look. 
With Ba'ul's help it's just 
a short flight away.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
All right, let's go.

## POINTER 32

I see. If you feel like doing 
some more work, let me know.

## POINTER 33

Oh, the job I mentioned last 
time is still open. Would 
you like to take it?
