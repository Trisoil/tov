Ah, <STR>(YUR)! Even if you're an 
employee, I can't let you 
into the women's baths!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
We're more part-timers 
than employees...<PAGE>But anyway, I was just 
coming to see if you've 
been working hard.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Yep, I'm hard 
at work! Look!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Oh wow... What's that all 
about? Are you playing 
dress-up or something?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Urgh! No! I'm an 
esthetician! An 
esthetician!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
An esthewazza? <STR>(EST_P) 
the esthewhosit...is this 
some kind of joke?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm a masseuse! I give the women 
massages to help them look and 
feel beautiful!<PAGE>It's hard work, but it's fun! I also get
to talk with all sorts of people while
I'm doing it, so it never gets boring.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm, well, I'm glad you're 
enjoying yourself. Keep 
up the good work.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
Of course! Don't you 
go slacking off either, <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, yeah.
