<STR>(EST_P)
Oh my... Doesn't the city seem 
less busy than before?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah. This place has gotten 
a lot more...ghost-towny.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
You don't think that 
rumor's true, do you?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
You mean that people have been suddenly disappearing?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Maybe it's not just a rumor after all.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
She has to do something about it.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
What do you mean?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
You can see it on her face.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
If that's the case, we should go to the 
inn and have a strategy meeting first.<PAGE>After all, we need to go 
check on the blastia too.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah. And it's not 
like <STR>(EST_P) can 
just let things go...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
You can't just ignore people's 
problems, can you?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
I know, I know.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
So then, let's go. To the inn!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
He sure is getting into it.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
He's so happy that he was able 
to start a guild with <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, it's not like I did this 
just for <STR>(KAR)'s sake.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
But you care about 
his feelings, don't 
you?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, well...<PAGE>Come on, we should 
hurry to the inn.
