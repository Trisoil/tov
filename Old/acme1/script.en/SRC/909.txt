Come on! Come on! Look 
at this! Look at this!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
What's this? It looks 
like a model...but what 
a strange shape...

## POINTER 2

Yes, yes! It's a 
model! A model!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Does this guy's way of talking tick 
off anyone else, or is it just me...?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
No, I feel ya.

## POINTER 5

It's heard...Everything 
that you've...Been saying...<PAGE>Everything...
What you were talking about...
Here and there...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
I don't know what the hell 
yer talkin' about. Put it 
in words we can understand!

## POINTER 7

Peek! Peek inside! You'll 
understand when you 
see, no problem!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
Hmmm, maybe we should 
just have a look?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
Yeah, good idea. For the experience, 
if for nothing else.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Wha? Wha? Why's everyone 
looking at me?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
You're the closest, and the shortest, 
too. It's easiest for you to do it.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Once again, I'm sacrificed 
for the greater good...<PAGE>I'm always taking the fall 
for everyone else...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
You're so lucky, <STR>(KAR)! Getting to experience 
new, mysterious things before anyone 
else, and twice! I'm so jealous!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Ugh...
Argh...here 
goes nothing!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
Whoa, that's awesome! 
I remember saying that! 
What the heck?!

## POINTER 16

You can call it the 
"Chat Player V"!<PAGE>It shows you the conversations, 
the ones in your heads, 
from long, long ago!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
I'm totally lost, but...this 
lets you read conversations you 
had a long time ago, then?

## POINTER 18

Yeees!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, this seems pretty handy. We should 
be able to put it to some good use. We 
can use it whenever we want, right?

## POINTER 20

Yeees! You can use it 
whenever you like!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
All right, we'll 
come again, then.
