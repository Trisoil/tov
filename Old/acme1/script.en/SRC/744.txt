Is this the book you're 
looking for?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Yes, there's no mistaking it. That's "Reflections 
on the Scent of the Sea."

## POINTER 2
Kaufman
Oh, so you're interested in my autobiography? 
Perhaps the allure of high seas profit 
has finally caught your eye?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
You wrote this? What 
the--oops, I mean, 
could we have it?

## POINTER 4
Kaufman
Straight and to the point, as usual. 
Heh, I admire your candor.<PAGE>You may have that book if you like.
Study it well...you might learn something.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Thank you. This 
helps a lot.

## POINTER 6
Kaufman
Oh my, all this interest in my life story and 
now words of thanks from you? I can feel
the winds of change blowing across the sea!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
All right, so you've finally 
gotten all of them?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Yep. I've collected 
all five.<PAGE>Now I can go and 
take that test.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Going out to look for books all across 
the world...what a crazy test!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Oh, the real test has yet to begin.<PAGE>There'll be a written test that requires 
using these books as reference material.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Agh, just thinking about taking 
tests makes my head hurt.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Wouldn't you like to give it a 
try? Just to see how you do.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, I wouldn't have a chance. I don't care 
about that what's-his-face degree anyway.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah, giving something like that to you would 
be like casting pearls before swine.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, who're you calling swine?!
