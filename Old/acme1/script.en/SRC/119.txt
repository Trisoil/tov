<STR>(YUR) Looowell! I know that you're 
here in these woods! Turn yourself 
in like a good boy!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
You've gotta be kidding me. 
Leblanc followed me all the 
way outside the barrier?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Uh, what? Who 
followed you?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, just some guys from the Imperial Knights...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Hah hah, yeah, right, the Knights are 
chasing their own former member.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Wait, seriously?!

## POINTER 6
Adecor
I-I say, c-come out now, will you?

## POINTER 7
Boccos
Sh-show yourself now and we-we'll 
spare you a pummeling!

## POINTER 8
Leblanc
Shaking in your boots at mere 
rumors...and you call yourselves 
knights of the Schwann Brigade.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
...So, what're they after you 
for? Vandalism? Fraud? Smuggling? 
Robbery? Murder? Arson?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Umm, it's really just for jailbreak...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Anyway, let's bolt!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
There we go.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
We can't do that! It'll get in the way 
of other people passing through!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Who's gonna be passing through? These 
woods are "cursed," remember?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
Waah, wait up!
