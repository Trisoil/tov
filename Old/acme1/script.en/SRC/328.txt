<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)? What's the matter?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
I was just thinking about what the 
magistrate here could be planning.<PAGE>It's so strange that he'd be looking for Phaeroh.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Though I guess it'd make sense if the 
empire wanted to eliminate a monster that 
was trying to kill the princess.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
But they don't know 
that he's after <STR>(EST_P) 
yet, do they?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
So why are they going after him, then?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
How should I know?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
And we still don't know why there's 
a curfew in the town.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Anyway, first, we should go 
to the Sands of Kogorh.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Right. We can look into 
the mysteries of this town 
once we come back.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
If we don't rescue those kids' 
parents soon, they'll keel 
over in this heat!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
...That's true.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
So then, to get to the middle of the desert, 
we should go through here, right?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
Yes. I think the parents of 
those children were probably 
taken this way, too.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
All right. Let's go.
