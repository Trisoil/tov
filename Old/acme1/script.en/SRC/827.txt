Wow, amazing! You've gotten so 
many rare treasures! We've never 
had anyone this lucky before.

<STR>(JUD)
Oh, really? There was only one 
each of them, so I figured 
they might be valuable...

## POINTER 2

Indeed! Out of all of 
the items we have, those 
were very special.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Well, this was a lot 
of fun. We got a ton 
of chips, too.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, and <STR>(JUD) 
had such a good time 
playing, too.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
The games are all so simple 
and fun... I guess they 
just suit me well.

## POINTER 6

I've been watching you, too. It seems 
you're quite the experienced gambler!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, why do you say that?

## POINTER 8

I was watching you while you played 
Poker, and the expression 
on your face never changed.<PAGE>You've got 
quite the 
poker face!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
You think something like 
a little hand of Poker 
could faze our <STR>(JUD_P)?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
Heh heh. Was that a
compliment I just heard?

## POINTER 11

Truly, truly, I am 
most impressed.<PAGE>You're the best gambler who's 
ever visited our establishment!
