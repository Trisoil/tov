<VOICE>(VA030_054)Now we've found most of the fell arms.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA030_055)They don't seem really powerful to me...

<VOICE>(VA030_056)Maybe there's something we have 
to do to awaken them fully.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA030_057)We'd be gettin' a big boost to our own 
strength if we could manage that.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA030_058)Though it wouldn't be good to 
depend upon them too much.

<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA030_059)That's right... Just like an 
over-reliance on blastia led

wrong type of people don't get them.

## POINTER 7
