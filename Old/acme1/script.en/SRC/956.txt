What's this do?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Get your grubby mitts off it! I don't 
want to have to tell you again!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
It seems like it might be an activation 
switch for the warp blastia upstairs.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Nothing's happening.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
It doesn't have enough aer.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Not enough...aer...<PAGE>...I wonder if that ring I 
got in the Shaikos Ruins might 
be able to do anything.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Ah, the Sorcerer's Ring. 
I'm not sure...<PAGE>But you might as well 
give it a try.
