Here's the small bird 
feather you asked for.

## POINTER 1

My, that was quick.<PAGE>Oh well. I had really taken 
a liking to it...but 
anyway, here you go.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
All right!

## POINTER 3

Wait wait wait! I brought it too! 
Here you go, a small bird feather!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
It's already a little...beaten up...

## POINTER 5

But I promised I'd give the necklace to 
the person who came back with the item 
first, so I already gave it to them.

## POINTER 6

W-what! Y-you're not going 
to give it to me!? 
But I must have it!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Unfortunately, we need this, 
too. Sorry, man, but we 
can't give it to you.

## POINTER 8

Damn...damn it! It looks like 
I'll have to use force...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAP)
*Big growl*

## POINTER 10

A-ack, no, violence 
isn't the solution...<PAGE>...Hah...I give up...oh, 
but, if only...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
I sort of feel bad for him.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
This is no time for pity, <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
This is Rhianna's necklace, anyway. It isn't 
ours to give, even if we wanted to.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah. You're right.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
All right, let's go back to Dahngrest!
