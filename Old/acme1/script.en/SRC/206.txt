<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS18_105)It doesn't seem like that <STR>(FRE) 
character is around here.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS18_106)Does that mean you're staying with us for now?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS18_107)Well, I... 
Would that be all right?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS18_108)<STR>(KAR), don't fill the princess's head with ideas.

## POINTER 4
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_109)You cannot simply do as 
you wish. Your Highness 
must return to the capital.

## POINTER 5
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_110)<STR>(FRE) has already set out 
to tend to other business.

## POINTER 6
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_111)Now then. <STR>(RIT) Mordio, we 
would like you to investigate 
yesterday's blastia malfunction.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS18_112)...That's pointless. I looked at 
him this morning, but I couldn't 
figure anything out.

## POINTER 8
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_113)No, we would ask that you go 
to the forest of Keiv Moc.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS18_114)...Keiv Moc, huh? Oh yeah, the plants 
affected by the disaster here look 
just like the ones in that forest.

## POINTER 10
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_115)We have reports of tree mutations 
and of monsters increasing in 
both number and aggressiveness.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS18_116)Messengers have gone to the 
capital, but much time will be 
wasted finding a gifted mage.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS18_117)I specialize in blastia. 
Plants are out of my league.

## POINTER 12
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_118)Consider their connection 
to the aer. I imagine that 
is within your league.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS18_119)Besides...I... If <STR>(EST_P) is 
going back to the capital, 
I want to go with her.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS18_120)What do you mean?

## POINTER 15
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_121)You are a researcher in an imperial 
blastia laboratory. You must 
undertake the tasks assigned to you.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS18_122)Um... Then there should 
be no problem if I accompany 
her to the forest, right?

## POINTER 17
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_123)Princess, please, do not 
make suggestions that are 
simply out of the question.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS18_124)If this does have something 
to do with aer, then my healing 
artes would prove useful.

## POINTER 19
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_125)Yes, they would...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS18_126)Please, Alexei! Let me 
do my part to help.

## POINTER 21
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_127)Your Highness, I simply 
cannot allow you to go to 
such a dangerous forest.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS18_128)Well, what if...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS18_129)<STR>(YUR), would you come with us?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS18_130)Me?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS18_131)If <STR>(YUR) were to come, you 
wouldn't be worried right?

## POINTER 26
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_132)Young man, please 
escort the Princess.

## POINTER 27
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_133)I ask this of you only 
because you once sought 
to join the Imperial Knights.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS18_134)...Of all the underhanded... I 
didn't ask anybody to count on 
me. You're pushing me into this.

## POINTER 29
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_135)It seems I can take that reply 
as indication of your agreement.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS18_136)But there's something I have 
to do as well. We go to the 
forest after Dahngrest.

## POINTER 31
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_137)Very well.

## POINTER 32
Khroma
<VOICE>(VS18_138)Your Excellency...

## POINTER 33
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_139)It seems <STR>(FRE) foresaw 
this outcome.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS18_140)Huh? He did what?

## POINTER 35
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_141)He left this message for you: 
"Take care of Her Highness."

## POINTER 36
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS18_142)All right then, it's the 
forest of Keiv Moc by 
way of Dahngrest!

## POINTER 37
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_143)I have a job for you.
