That Cumore punk is 
a really lousy guy.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
I wonder why they're trying 
to capture Phaeroh.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
I don't know, 
but...<PAGE>At this rate, they're going to 
send all of the adults in the 
town out into the desert.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
And once the adults are 
gone, it might be the 
children's turn, next.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
No, that can't happen!<PAGE>If I just spoke to him as a representative 
of the imperial family...!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
Are you forgetting what 
happened in Heliord?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, <STR>(EST_P). He didn't care that 
you were the princess at all.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
So should we help the townspeople, 
or should we help ourselves?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RIT)...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
Don't you want to know what 
the Entelexeia is thinking?<PAGE>If so, you should put this whole business with 
Cumore out of your mind for the time being.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
It's a strange feeling to be agreeing with you, but...<PAGE>I think we should focus on 
meeting Belius for now.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Even if we captured Cumore, we wouldn't have 
the authority to try him for his crimes.<PAGE>If we can't do anything about him, we should 
focus on what we actually can do.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
If only <STR>(FRE) were here...!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(FRE)... But where 
is he...?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
I wish I knew...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
I'm sorry, <STR>(EST_P)... We don't 
mean to be ganging up on you.<PAGE>It disgusts me, too, to imagine 
that jerk snoring all nice and 
cozy in his bed right now.<PAGE>But...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RIT)...I understand.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
Lock up a guy like that, and as soon 
as he's released he'll just end up 
doing the same thing again.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
Yep. You know what they 
say...the only cure for 
stupidity is death.

"The only cure for stupidity is death..."
