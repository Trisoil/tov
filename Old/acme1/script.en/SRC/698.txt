Red...so very red... This 
year's especially bad...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
What's the matter, Mayor?

## POINTER 2

Oh ho. You're back?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
What about something being red?

## POINTER 4

Oh, it's just that this year's flowers are an especially deep 
shade of red, so I was thinking that the curse of the caged 
emperor's bride must be particularly strong this year...<PAGE>But... I'm just joking, 
of course.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Who's this caged emperor's bride supposed to be?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
About 300 years ago, the emperor at the 
time, Brimstone the Fourth, planted a tree 
on the perimeter of Halure's barrier.<PAGE>He lived all of his later years shut up inside his castle, 
so people took to calling him the caged emperor.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
It's always so educational to have you around, <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
But what does the caged emperor's 
bride have to do with this tree?

## POINTER 9

Legend has it that the caged emperor 
murdered his fiancee, and buried her corpse 
beneath the roots of this tree.<PAGE>The tree gets its red color from the murdered 
bride's blood, which its roots absorb.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Wha... What the hell...

## POINTER 11

It's really nothing more than a legend.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Of course. There's no way a tree 
could keep sucking up someone's 
blood for centuries, anyway.

## POINTER 13

Yes. But I'm worried that this macabre 
tale will spread and drive potential 
visitors away from our town.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
U-ummm...then don't you think 
it's a bad idea telling 
it to travelers like us?

## POINTER 15

I...uhh... Oops. Okay, forget all about 
that story I just told you, could you?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
How are we supposed to forget something like that?!

## POINTER 17

If you don't forget it, the 
caged emperor's bride will hold 
a grudge against you...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
C-cut it 
out...!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
There you go again! You're just 
reinforcing the legend.

## POINTER 20

Oops...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
...There's no way that story's true...
