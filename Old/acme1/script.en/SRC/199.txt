<STR>(EST_P)! You haven't 
gone back yet!

## POINTER 1

No, I haven't.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(FRE)
It'll be some time before the Imperial Knights 
are able to move out, after all.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh by the way, <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 4
<STR>(FRE)
Yes, milady?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
Is it okay if I stay with 
<STR>(YUR) and his friends until 
I go back to the capital?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(FRE)
I understand. Only until 
you return, though.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. I won't cause you any 
more trouble, <STR>(FRE).
