Hey, what is 
this place?

## POINTER 2

Sir, you have arrived at Yumanju Hot 
Spring Spa, home of the finest open-air 
baths that Terca Lumireis has to offer!<PAGE>The Yumanju springs are 
famous the world over.

What's an open-air bath?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
It's a hot spring where you go 
outside to take a bath and relax.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Take a bath outside? I've never 
heard of anything like it.

## POINTER 6

I think you'll find that it feels 
quite nice, and liberating, too!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
I just get in the bathtub and hop 
right out as soon as I'm clean. 
Who cares how "nice" it is?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR), it's best for your 
body if you soak for 
a while and relax.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
Open-air baths, huh? Sounds like quite a sight to 
see. I wonder what it feels like to sit in them.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Oh wow, this sounds great! 
I want to go in! â™ª

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
I think it sounds like quite a sight to 
see, too! If you know what I mean. *Wink*

## POINTER 12

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Can we go in?

## POINTER 14

Unfortunately, you 
cannot! You cannot!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
Whaaaat!! Why can't 
we go in? You 
big meanie!

## POINTER 16

I assure you, I am not a "meanie." The baths 
are simply being cleaned right now.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
Seriously? What 
a tease!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
Let's come back the next time we get a chance.

## POINTER 19

I am terribly sorry! We look 
forward to your next visit!
