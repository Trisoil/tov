Diiing! I'm Kowz! You can call me Li'l K for 
short. Nice to meetcha, better to greetcha!<PAGE>The sky's all 
squirmy...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Does it bother you?

## POINTER 2

Me? Nah. Who cares? No 
point in getting aaaall 
worked up about it!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
So ya just take things as they 
come? Ya take more of a
philosophical view of things?

## POINTER 4

I have a philosophy of going with 
the flow! You know, like a cloud, 
floating along with the breeze...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Hmmm, that mumbo jumbo almost 
sounds believable...

## POINTER 6

You should shut that big yap of yours before someone 
trips on it, Flatty. You wouldn't know hopes 
and dreams if they smacked you in the face!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Argh... You're really 
asking for it now!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(RIT), control yourself!

## POINTER 9

Oh, Pheromone-Boy! You're 
so thoughtful. ∀<PAGE>To show my respect for you, 
Pheromone-Boy, let me take 
some of your excess items.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
We have excess 
items?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Not that I know of. We pretty 
much need what we have.

## POINTER 12

No, you definitely look like 
you have some items to spare!

## POINTER 13

Come on, give them 
here! Gimme gimme! 
Pleeease!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
Why do you 
want items 
so badly?

## POINTER 15

My tale is sad to hear and even sadder to tell. The reasons for my 
desires run deep, and are born of tears and sorrow! But it would take 
too long to tell you everything, so just take my word for it.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
What the hell are you 
going on about? Stop 
being so vague!

## POINTER 17

Well, today's items du 
jour are the All-Divide 
and the Hourglass.<PAGE>Do you have any extras of these 
two items? If so, gimme!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Why do you want all 
this stuff?
Here, just take it.

## POINTER 19

Oh ho ho. Thanks 
much!

## POINTER 20

Round and round we go!
Where we stop...only I know!

## POINTER 21

Caatch!

## POINTER 22

Oh ho, oh 
ho! Thankee, 
thankee!

## POINTER 23

No, thank you!<PAGE>Now then, to return 
the favor...

## POINTER 24

Tadaaa!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RAV)
Eh? Hmm... This 
ain't so bad...

## POINTER 26

Your very own set of gels! 
I like to call it the "Chewy 
Chewy Yummy Pack!"

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RIT)
I'd say we broke 
about even...

## POINTER 28
<STR>(JUD)
So what happens to the 
items that we give you?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, yeah, I wanna 
know, too!

## POINTER 30

Hmmm... That'd take 
a long time to explain. 
I don't wanna...

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RIT)
Come on, 
tell us!

## POINTER 32

Oh, would you look at the time! 
Come again, won't you? I'll 
be waiting! Ding-dong-ding! ∀

## POINTER 33

You don't 
have them, 
you fools!

## POINTER 34

Agh, the bitter taste 
of rejection!

## POINTER 35

Hello, hello! I've been waiting! 
Did you come to give me an All-Divide 
and an Hourglass?
