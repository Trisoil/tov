## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)? What's the matter?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
I was just thinking about 
what <STR>(JUD) said. "Ba'ul saved 
me during the war..."<PAGE>I just realized that maybe she was talking 
about the Great War when she said that.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
So maybe she fought against 
the empire with that dragon 
freak during the Great War?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Maybe <STR>(RAV) can tell us. 
You fought in the Great 
War, didn't ya, old man?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Huh? Why?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
I'd think only someone who 
was on the scene would know 
so much about the war.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Really? But, there weren't 
supposed to be very many 
survivors, right?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
Very true...I thought I was 
gonna die back then, too.<PAGE>Ah, if only I'd died then, 
things would've been so 
much easier, too...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
If only you'd died? What 
a weird thing to say...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
So, did you ever see <STR>(JUD) 
during the war?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
No, not a chance. I may be a player, 
but 10-year-old girls are definitely 
off-limits for me.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Oh geez...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
Hmm, I feel like I never saw 
Ba'ul, either. Maybe they ran 
away from the battle?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
So it was really the Entelexeia 
who fought in the battle?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
Yes, I guess so. Though at the time 
we thought they were only a really 
terrible breed of monsters.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
But wow, you were really 
in the war, huh <STR>(RAV)?<PAGE>That's so cool. I thought only Imperial 
Knights fought in the war.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
Maybe I'll tell you more about 
it when you're older.
