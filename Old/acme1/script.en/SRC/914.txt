Oh! That look on your face... 
Could it be...?!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
Yessir! I single-handedly 
managed ta collect 
the entire series!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Whaddya mean single-handedly...

## POINTER 3

Please, let 
me see them!

## POINTER 4

Fantastic...simply fantastic. 
You really have 
all 11 of them!<PAGE>Oh, I can't wait! I really 
can't wait! I can't wait to 
decorate my room with them!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
I'm glad that you're so 
happy! So this means our 
job is done, right?

## POINTER 6

Oh, sorry about that... I 
got a little carried away.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
No, not at all. I 
know how ya feel.

## POINTER 8

Now, for your reward! Hmmm, 
what would be appropriate...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Ummm...

## POINTER 10

Gald, perhaps? Or maybe 
an item? Maybe another 
toy might do the trick?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
Ummm! Excuse 
me!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
What's the matter, <STR>(EST_P)? 
Why are you yelling?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
......<PAGE>Do you think you might 
be able to give us 
back that c L Statue?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Wh-what are you talking 
about, <STR>(EST_P)? He asked 
for the whole set of 11!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
An incomplete set 
is worthless ta 
a collector.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
I know that. It's just...we 
can't give him that 
one doll...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, this is about Hanks, right?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
That doll is his memento of his wife... 
It's very important to him.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
But didn't he give 
it to you, <STR>(EST_P)?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
But it's still his! 
We have to give 
it back to him!<PAGE>So, please...please...just 
let us keep that doll...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(EST_P)...

## POINTER 22

But still, you gave me that doll as 
part of the job I asked you to do...

## POINTER 23

H-hold on! What do you 
think you're doing?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
Ahh, I'm sorry... All 
of these are fakes.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(KAR)
Y-<STR>(YUR)? What are you 
talking about?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
I was thinking I'd get 
the reward by handing 
over a bunch of fakes.<PAGE>But it looked like <STR>(EST_P) 
was about to spill the beans, 
so I stole them all back.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
You stole them back...?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
So I'm sorry. It 
looks like the job 
was a failure.

## POINTER 29

What the...! Are you trying 
to make me look like a fool?! 
I can't believe this!

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RAV)
Agh, it looks like we missed out on 
the reward... After all that work, 
all we got was a single tiara...

## POINTER 31
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR), thank 
you!!

## POINTER 32
<STR>(YUR)
That's the only valuable thing 
Hanks has ever had. I couldn't 
let you give it away.<PAGE>Besides, this thing's gotta be a fake, 
right? If anyone found out, it would 
soil the good name of Brave Vesperia!

## POINTER 33
<STR>(RIT)
What a load of bull... Good thing 
that guy was too dense to recognize 
bad acting when he saw it.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(JUD)
Why didn't we just actually 
make a fake doll and 
give it to him?

## POINTER 35
<STR>(RIT)
You're even worse than <STR>(YUR)...
