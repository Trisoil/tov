...C-come in.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
You can't keep using your healing 
artes on her forever, <STR>(EST_P).<PAGE>Come on, let's let 
her rest for now.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
I can't believe she had to go and do something like that.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. Once <STR>(RIT) chooses to 
do something, she won't listen 
to anyone else...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
You're one to talk! You were 
just as bad as she was.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
...I'm sorry.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
I'm going to stay here. You should 
go rest. Aren't you tired from using 
your healing artes so much?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm jealous of <STR>(RIT). She has something 
she cares about so much...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
And so can you, if you spend enough time looking for 
it. But you need to go and get some sleep now.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
No, I'm fine. <STR>(YUR), you should 
get some sleep, yourself.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(FRE) will get mad at 
me if you pass out.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
So let him get mad at you.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Look, don't come asking me to take your 
place when you collapse from exhaustion!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
I can't ask you to take 
my place if I've already 
collapsed, can I?
