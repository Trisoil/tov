Here it is! This is "The Village 
Carpeted with Flowers!"

## POINTER 1

Ah, such a tattered, old 
book you have there...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Ummm...would you mind 
if we borrowed it?

## POINTER 3

Certainly, I don't mind. It's 
just some old technical book. 
It's all gibberish to me.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Thanks a lot.

## POINTER 5

No, think nothing of it. I can 
never thank you enough for
what you've done for our town.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
All right, so you've finally 
gotten all of them?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Yep. I've collected 
all five.<PAGE>Now I can go and 
take that test.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Going out to look for books all across 
the world...what a crazy test!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
Oh, the real test has yet to begin.<PAGE>There'll be a written test that requires 
using these books as reference material.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Agh, just thinking about taking 
tests makes my head hurt.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
Wouldn't you like to give it a 
try? Just to see how you do.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, I wouldn't have a chance. I don't care 
about that what's-his-face degree anyway.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah, giving something like that to you
would be like casting pearls before swine.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, who're you calling swine?!
