time ta relax...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
We've still got a lot of big problems 
ahead of us...but I guess we can 
forget about them, for now.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Right! Save 
your worries 
for later!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
When you're so busy, it's easy to 
forget to just slow down and relax.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
Oh, you ladies are here 
too? You were so quiet... 
I had no idea.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
What do you mean? You mean 
you would've come over to 
spy on us if you had known?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
Huh? Why would I go all the way 
over there ta see a bunch of 
flat-chested little girls?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
What did you say, you 
perverted old troll?!<PAGE>Get your butt over 
here right now or 
it's fireball time!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
Why don't ya come over ta 
the men's side? I dare ya!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)

your wrinkly old 
geezer bits!

## POINTER 12

If you two don't settle 
down, the water's 
going to get cold.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
What? You all 
haven't changed 
yet?<PAGE>The girls are all 
out of the bath and 
done changing.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
The girls are done, eh...
All of us have finished 
changing, too!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)

be talking through 
a partition, do we?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Right, we're already 
out...<PAGE>Aaaaachooo!!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
We'd better get inside before 
Captain <STR>(KAR) of the Lone 
Towel catches a cold.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
Why are you the only one 
still in a towel...?
