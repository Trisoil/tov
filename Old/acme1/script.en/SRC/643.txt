...There's someone here...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Those guys are from Ruins' Gate.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Hearing about Ruins' Gate again 
makes me think of Regaey...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Don't forget that the Regaey 
we saw was an imposter.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Regaey was 
Yeager.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Wait, I thought that Yeager 
was just disguising himself 
as the real Regaey.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Really?

## POINTER 7

Hey, look at this funny-looking 
thingamabob I found.

## POINTER 8

Archie, you've found a part 
of a blastia housing.

## POINTER 9

This is so awesome, Mark. I'll bet it's 
a priceless historical artifact.

## POINTER 10

Let's get this back to Aspio 
in a hurry and show it 
to the researchers.

## POINTER 11

Don't forget to write your 
name on it to prove you're 
the one who found it.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Just what do you guys 
think you're doing...?!

## POINTER 13

Wh-what's going on?!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Who do you think you are, 
vandalizing a valuable 
specimen like that?

## POINTER 15

Itâ€™s my natural right as 
the one who found it.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
You idiot! What are you trying to do?!
Ack! ...It's not coming off!<PAGE>Okay, you two, sit your 
butts down, NOW!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Uh, <STR>(RIT)? What're you doing?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
I'm going to explain to these half-wits 
the importance of treating blastia 
with a little respect!

## POINTER 19

Look, Archie, I think the 
little mage is going to 
give us a presentation.

## POINTER 20

Hmph... Why's she so 
high and mighty...?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
Shut up and listen!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
...Got it?!

## POINTER 23

Yes, ma'am.

## POINTER 24

I've never heard so many words come 
out of such a little person...

## POINTER 25

...I think we'd be better 
off doing as she says.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
Sheesh... I'm gonna give Ruins' 
Gate a piece of my mind when 
I get back to Aspio...

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
Still, they seem 
really harmless.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RIT)
I guess you're right... But it's 
the well-meaning idiots that 
sometimes do the most damage.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
Aw, come on. Lighten up.
