That looks like the engine room to me.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
That sure is some heavy security.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
It doesn't look like it'll 
be too easy to stop it.<PAGE>We might have to keep <STR>(FRE) and 
the others waiting for a while.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
It'll be impossible to force our 
way inside with that many guards.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
W-what?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Since when are you so level-headed?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
We've come this far--don't you think we 
should be careful not to mess things up?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Well, if we can stop this thing from 
moving for a little while, <STR>(FRE) and 
his men will be able to get inside.<PAGE>Let's go check out the control room.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(RAV), do you know where 
the control room is?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Sorry. That's one thing 
I don't know.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
What if the control room's 
even more heavily guarded?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
In that case, we'll have no choice 
but to force our way in.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
Well, that'll mean
war against the 
imperial knights.<PAGE>Not always easy to be courageous.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Let's hope it doesn't 
come to that...
