Hmmm, this is quite a pickle...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
You always seem to be getting 
yourself into pickles.

## POINTER 2
Kaufman
Oh!
Heh, no rest for the wicked... 
Though, I guess that doesn't 
really apply here.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Is something the matter?

## POINTER 4
Kaufman
I've been helping with the 
festival here, you see.

## POINTER 5
Kaufman
See that guy over there? He's been over there in the 
Casino Corner cleaning everyone out for a while now.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Wow, he must be 
really good.

## POINTER 7
Kaufman
Either that or he's cheating. 
And pretty skilled at it, too.<PAGE>Either way, at this rate, 
he's going to ruin the 
festival for everyone.<PAGE>But I guess this is something 
I can't really ask you to 
help me with, isn't it?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
...In other words, 
all we need to do 
is make him leave?

## POINTER 9
Kaufman
Oh? Can you do that? I'd be happy to give you a reward 
if you can manage to get him to go away. You could 
think of it as an official request to your guild.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
A reward for a successful 
job, you say...? But <STR>(JUD),
can you really do that?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
Hmm, I wonder. I won't 
know unless I try!
