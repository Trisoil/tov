Hey, Captain <STR>(KAR)! 
What're you up to?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Ahhh! 
<STR>(YUR)!!<PAGE>How come I was the only one who 
didn't get a uniform? They only 
gave me this one towel!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
I'll bet it was all they 
could do. I doubt they had 
any clothes in kid size.<PAGE>What's the problem? 
Just sit in the water 
and enjoy yourself.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
I can't stay here for the entire 
time! I'll shrivel up like a prune! 
I wonder if I can leave yet...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
There's not anything 
to do outside, anyway. 
Relax and stay here.<PAGE>Everyone else is working pretty 
hard. They wouldn't really 
have time to chat anyway.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
What about you, <STR>(YUR)? Don't you 
have anything better to do?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
I'm on guard duty. I'm 
making my rounds! 
This is hard work!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Ugh, why do you get to have all the fun...?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Oh well, give it a 
bit and then come 
on out, I guess.<PAGE>The guests should be coming 
in here pretty soon anyway.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah...
All right.
