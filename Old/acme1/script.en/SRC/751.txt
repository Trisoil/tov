Oh, it's you...

## POINTER 1

Look at this...!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
...That's...!

## POINTER 3

It's magic using spirits. It's 
not yet complete, though.

## POINTER 4

Pretty nice, eh? This 
guy managed to work
out the spirit formula.

## POINTER 5

Nah, this is nothing, really.

## POINTER 6

I have to say, I'm impressed that you 
managed to cast a spell like this.

## POINTER 7

Heh heh, please, you're too kind.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
You've already started doing spirit research 
despite all of your objections earlier? Don't 
you think that's a little hypocritical?

## POINTER 9

We're still continuing our blastia research.

## POINTER 10

We've just added one more area in 
which to focus that research!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
Well, not that I mind or anything. 
So, what sort of formula is it?

## POINTER 12

Don't be so nosy!

## POINTER 13

We're all mages of Aspio, aren't we? 
We can be civil to each other.<PAGE>We can trust you to keep the construction 
of this formula an Aspian secret?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Of course.

## POINTER 15

First you draw a textual formula around the 
outside edge to isolate the fire attribute...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(RIT) seemed pretty worried, but it looks 
like things are going to work out.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
As researchers, their desire to study 
new things is too powerful to fight.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah. They may be older than <STR>(RIT), but these 
mages are all made of the same stuff.

## POINTER 19

...So that's how it works, but this part is 
something we haven't been able to understand.<PAGE>How would you do it?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Hmmmmm...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
I've got it! 
Like this...!

## POINTER 22

Fwoah...

## POINTER 23

...Hey hey... That's 
just too powerful!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
S-sorry...

## POINTER 25

But...I think that 
we can use this!

## POINTER 26

Yes. What do you think?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RIT)
Yes... Do you mind 
if I use it?

## POINTER 28

Well, we'd prefer something 
a little less volatile.

## POINTER 29

We're going to see if there might 
be a slightly more practical 
direction we can take it in.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
Right... Let me give it some 
more thought, as well.<PAGE>If I come up with a better way to use 
that formula, I'll let you know.

## POINTER 31

Thanks a lot!
