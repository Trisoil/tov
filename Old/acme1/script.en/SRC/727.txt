Hey <STR>(KAR). Can't sleep?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
...Yeah... I had this...bad 
dream...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Bad dream...?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
I was dreaming that everyone was about to die, 
and I was trying to run to save them...but no 
matter how hard I ran, I never got any closer.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
That sounds like a pretty bad dream, yeah.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
I got so scared 
that I woke up...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Well, if you can't sleep, at least you won't 
be keeping us up with all your noise.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
You don't know...? Well, maybe 
that makes sense. <STR>(KAR), you 
talk in your sleep. A lot.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
How would I know that? I'm 
asleep when it happens!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Ha ha...yeah, I guess you're right.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(KAR)... If you're still 
shaken up about the 
Don's death...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
......

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
It's not just what happened to the Don.<PAGE>I don't know what I should 
do for Brave Vesperia. I don't 
even know what I can do.<PAGE>I still have to figure that out.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
I see.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
And that's why I've been having 
some trouble sleeping.<PAGE>Do you have worries that are keeping you up, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, not me. I'm a 
man of action, heh.<PAGE>Thinking about things too much just makes my head hurt. 
I prefer moving my body, rather than those rusty 
gears in my head. It suits my personality better.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Your personality, huh...I wonder what 
suits my personality better...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Maybe if you went to sleep and had a good dream, 
it would help you figure things out a bit?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
I can't keep running 
away to my dreams.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
You wouldn't be running away. 
You'd be dreaming so that 
you can come back to us.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
I'm sure once I go back to the inn 
and lie down I'll be able to sleep.<PAGE>Don't worry about me. You go on ahead.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Gotcha.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Even if he reasons things out in his head, 
his heart is slow to follow suit.<PAGE>I guess that's just how he is...
