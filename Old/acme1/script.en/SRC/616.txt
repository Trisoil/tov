## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Pardon me, but we are on our 
way to Sir Cumore's residence. 
Can you let us through?

## POINTER 2

P-princess?! But what 
are you doing here?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
So long as the Princess is with us, 
there can be no problem, surely.

## POINTER 4

Captain Schwann... I could never 
refuse entry to either of you...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
We're in!â™ª

## POINTER 6

You should know though, Sir Cumore's 
residence is currently uninhabited.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
What...? But why?

## POINTER 8

Captain Cumore struggled numerous times 
to exhibit proper...conduct as a Knight.<PAGE>During his assignments at Heliord and 
Mantaic, he was at the center of some 
rather unseemly developments.<PAGE>As a result, he was stripped 
not only of his home, but of 
his noble status as well.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Huh. That guy's had 
some ups and downs.

## POINTER 10

What's more, his sister, Miss Mimula, 
was recently apprehended for her involvement 
in aiding the extremists.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Mimula... Hey wait, 
is that...?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
That ill-mannered girl we 
did a job for earlier.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Huh... That's no big surprise. 
I kept thinking she reminded 
me of somebody.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Do you know where this 
Mimula is right now?

## POINTER 15

It hasn't been long since she was taken into custody, 
so she should still be down in the prison.
