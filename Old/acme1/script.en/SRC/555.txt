<VOICE>(VS65_092)Duke...!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_093)Duke, we have the four elemental 
spirits. Their power can 
counter the Adephagos.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS65_094)There's no need to use people 
to destroy the Adephagos!

## POINTER 3
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_095)Look at its size. Four spirits 
are nothing against it.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS65_096)They're crucial. We'll make up the rest by 
turning the blastia cores to spirits too.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS65_097)Every single core in the world!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS65_098)And as a bonus, it'll put an 
end to the blastia culture 
that you hate so much.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_099)Not too shabby, huh?

## POINTER 7
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_100)...I doubt humans will hand 
over their blastia quietly. 
Or will you force them?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS65_101)Can you not believe 
that people can move 
forward and change?

## POINTER 9
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_102)Humans will not let something 
go once it is in their grasp.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_103)So you won't listen...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_104)We will destroy 
the Adephagos 
our own way.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_105)Please, wait just a little longer.

## POINTER 11
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_106)...And will the world return 
to its former state?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS65_107)Huh?

## POINTER 13
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_108)Will the aer be controlled 
by the Entelexeia?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_109)Will all life return 
to a time when 
nature ruled?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS65_110)No...

## POINTER 15
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_111)You are changing this world-our 
Terca Lumireis-for what?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_112)For the convenience 
of humans. Nothing 
more.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS65_113)Can't you think that the 
world might be growing?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_114)I think of the Entelexeia 
becoming spirits as evolution. 
Can't you see that?

## POINTER 17
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_115)...I would not presume to speak 
on the choices of the Entelexeia.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_116)However, I also have my choices.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_117)So you won't listen 
to us because 
we're humans?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS65_118)You say you can't trust people 
so you just drop everything.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_119)Then when it's too late, you 
try to wipe them out?!

## POINTER 20
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_120)...Do you know what 
this tower is?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_121)Tarqaron was once a city, 
but the ancients turned 
it into a weapon.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_122)To destroy the Entelexeia!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_123)ÔºÅ

## POINTER 22
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_124)To the ancients who did not recognize 
the threat of the blastia...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_125)...the Entelexeia, who attacked the blastia, 
were nothing more than a nuisance.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS65_126)And the aer went out of balance, 
and the Adephagos appeared...

## POINTER 24
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_127)Only then did humans listen to 
the words of the Entelexeia.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_128)Our world has seen many sacrifices. 
Yet humans committed the same 
offence. And they will again.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_129)Those who eat away and 
ruin this world...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_130)Those who would change the world for 
their own continued existence...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_131)They are apostles of destruction 
greater than even the Adephagos.

## POINTER 25
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_132)I made a vow to my friend, that 
I would protect this world.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS65_133)Elucifur...

## POINTER 27
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_134)...So Khroma told you?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_135)Yeah. She also told 
us to stop you.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS65_136)She listened to 
us, too, and became 
a spirit.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_137)So please, we can do this together...

## POINTER 30
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_138)...Enough.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_139)If the Entelexeia would throw away their 
mission, then I will take it up.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_140)I need not wait for your method. 
Once I complete this formula, 
the world will be saved.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_141)Duke... Stop!

## POINTER 32
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_142)As long as humans rule, they will commit 
the same offence time and again.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_143)If that happens, their hearts 
will grow wild, and the future 
will be even more painful.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS65_144)Even if that happens, 
it is the path we choose.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_145)Even if we are hurt or stopped, 
we can still walk again as 
long as we don't give up!

## POINTER 34
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS65_146)She's right.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_147)You'll never find anything 
new if you're afraid of making 
mistakes. Of failing.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_148)And unlike you, we 
haven't chosen this 
path on our own.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_149)Everyone decided on it.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS65_150)Yeah! Going it alone 
might be tough...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_151)...but we're not alone. If 
one person can't do it, 
then we do it together.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_152)I finally learned that we can 
walk together like that!

## POINTER 36
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_153)That may be sufficient for those 
who are connected to one another.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_154)However, there will always be some who 
cannot accept a difficult future.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_155)You all surely 
understand that.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS65_156)It will be difficult, 
but that is reality.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_157)But they will take what changes, 
think, and change again. Both 
the people and the world.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_158)So even if it takes tens, 
hundreds of years...they 
will listen someday.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_159)I know this now.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_160)That's what it 
means to live.

## POINTER 38
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS65_161)Right. There are 
things you have 
to protect...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_162)But this old man wants to see what lies 
ahead for people in the next era.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_163)See how the fools change. 
For those who can't 
see them anymore.

## POINTER 39
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_164)We are in contradiction...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_165)...However our feelings 
for the world are no 
different. How odd.

## POINTER 40
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_166)No, it's not.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_167)The future we chose...what 
we see for the future...is 
different.

## POINTER 41
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_168)The future must be protected. If it 
is not, then destruction awaits.

## POINTER 42
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_169)We make the future. You trust the 
path you choose and create it.

## POINTER 43
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_170)...It is inevitable.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_171)Come!

## POINTER 44
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_018)Child of the Full Moon... Why 
would you stand in my way?

## POINTER 45
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA000_019)A thousand years ago... 
My ancestors gave their 
lives to protect this world.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_020)I want to carry on 
their bravery...!

## POINTER 46
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_021)You must understand by now. The 
Children of the Full Moon are not 
suited to living in this world.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_022)It is your duty, then, to 
die here as your ancestors 
did, with courage.

## POINTER 47
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA000_023)They weren't brave just because 
they chose to die.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_024)Their courage came from 
refusing to give up hope, and 
their pride in defending this world.

## POINTER 48
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_025)...Words are 
cheap.

## POINTER 49
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA000_026)Which is why I've come to 
prove myself through my actions.

## POINTER 50
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_027)The time has come, then, 
to show me that pride...<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_028)Try to defeat me! Come!

## POINTER 51
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_041)Humans prey upon this world. 
You cannot protect both.

## POINTER 52
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA000_042)Things are different now! 
The world can change! That's 
what the spirit conversion is for!

## POINTER 53
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_043)The world may change, 
but its people will not.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_044)I cannot allow the world to 
change simply because humans 
will not change themselves.

## POINTER 54
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA000_045)People can change!

## POINTER 55
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_046)...We may feel the same 
toward this world, but we 
will never see eye to eye.

## POINTER 56
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_047)...You leave me no choice.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_048)Come!

## POINTER 57
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_058)Young mage... Can you 
truly stand by while all 
this world's blastia are lost...?

## POINTER 58
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA000_059)I don't care. My conviction 
is what mattered. 
My faith in blastia...<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_060)...Actually, it was more like love.

## POINTER 59
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_061)In the end, though, 
they were not worth 
risking your life to save.

## POINTER 60
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA000_062)What are you, stupid? 
It's not about "risking my life."<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_063)Even without blastia, there 
are plenty of things in 
this world worth loving.

## POINTER 61
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_064)Abandoning the old for 
the convenience of the new...
Perhaps that would work...

## POINTER 62
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_065)But I for one will risk my life.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_066)Though I must endure the scorn 
of youth, I will risk my 
life to protect this world!

## POINTER 63
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_099)And so we must face each other...<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_100)...Yet our feelings 
for this world are no 
different. How odd.

## POINTER 64
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA000_101)I don't get it either. How could 
anybody wipe out a world with 
so many gorgeous ladies?

## POINTER 65
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_102)You still insist on playing a fool...

## POINTER 66
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA000_103)Oh absolutely! I will fool around 
as long as this mud ball and 
its pretty ladies need savin'.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_104)...I'm gonna put my foot down 
this time. Since I got my heart 
set on livin', and all.

## POINTER 67
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_105)...Utter nonsense.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_106)Come!

## POINTER 68
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA000_080)I just don't get it.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_081)We started from 
the same place...

## POINTER 69
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_082)...I do not understand it, either. 
One would think we would also 
strive for the same future.

## POINTER 70
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_083)Why are you...?

## POINTER 71
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA000_084)Why must we fight...?

## POINTER 72
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_085)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

## POINTER 73
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA000_086)So...<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_087)You don't even see yourself 
in the future you envision...

## POINTER 74
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_088)...My existence, as well, may 
one day bring ruin to this world.

## POINTER 75
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA000_089)How nice of you to 
sacrifice yourself.

## POINTER 76
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_090)...Enough. Come!

## POINTER 77
<STR>(RAP)
<VOICE>(VA000_115)Woof...!

## POINTER 78
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_116)...Even as a dog, you 
would defend this world?<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_117)Such valor and wisdom 
deserve praise.

## POINTER 79
<STR>(RAP)
<VOICE>(VA000_118)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

## POINTER 80
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_119)However, be that as it may, 
your choice is one of folly.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_120)In the world I would create, 
you would go on living. Still, 
you would risk your life to stop me?

## POINTER 81
<STR>(RAP)
<VOICE>(VA000_121)Woof!

## POINTER 82
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_122)I would not wish for your 
death... But if you stand in my 
way I will have no choice...

## POINTER 83
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_123)Come!

## POINTER 84
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_172)Now I know what Phaeroh 
saw in you...

## POINTER 85
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_173)You're pretty strong yourself.

## POINTER 86
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_174)Humph. How unfortunate. I wish 
I could walk together with 
you all a while longer.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_175)Perhaps we would have had a different encounter...

## POINTER 87
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_176)It's not too late.

## POINTER 88
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_177)It is. My path was 
set when the Adephagos 
covered the sky.

## POINTER 89
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS65_178)You stubborn bastard!

## POINTER 90
Duke
<VOICE>(VS65_179)The best path for an 
enduring world is to return 
it to its natural state.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS65_180)That is the path I chose! I 
will die for that. My friend...give 
me your strength!

## POINTER 91
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_029)...So this is your pride... 
The bravery of which you spoke...<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_030)However, the past Children of 
the Full Moon saw in their 
deaths, humanity's final hope...<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_031)Are you prepared to die for 
your cause, as they did?

## POINTER 92
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA000_032)I won't die. I will live, 
and walk this new world 
together with all people.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_033)Even with 
you.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_034)You aren't the enemy 
we should be fighting.

## POINTER 93
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_035)A future for everyone, together...
That would be good....

## POINTER 94
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA000_036)Then...

## POINTER 95
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_037)No, it is too late. 
My path was set when the 
Adephagos covered the sky.

## POINTER 96
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA000_038)But...!

## POINTER 97
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_039)The best path for an 
enduring world is to return 
it to its natural state.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_040)That is the path I chose! 
I will die for that. 
My friend...grant me your strength!

## POINTER 98
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_049)Now I know what Phaeroh 
saw in you...

## POINTER 99
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA000_050)You'll never beat us...!

## POINTER 100
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_051)Humph. How unfortunate. I wish 
our paths had crossed earlier.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_052)Perhaps we would have met now 
under different circumstances.

## POINTER 101
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA000_053)Would you have 
agreed with the way 
we did things?

## POINTER 102
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_054)...No, it could never have 
worked. We have walked different 
paths from the very start.

## POINTER 103
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA000_055)Then, I guess we 
have to fight...

## POINTER 104
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_056)The best path for an 
enduring world is to return 
it to its natural state.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_057)That is the path I chose! 
I will die for that. 
My friend...grant me your strength!

## POINTER 105
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA000_067)You're just feeling sorry for 
yourself because you can't change. 
...Humph. Pathetic.

## POINTER 106
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_068)...Say what you will. 
I will walk my own path...

## POINTER 107
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA000_069)I probably would've 
said the same thing when 
I was still in Aspio.

## POINTER 108
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_070)I have no intention of 
betraying who I was.

## POINTER 109
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA000_071)I'm not ashamed of 
who I was, either.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_072)I am the person I am now 
precisely because of who I was.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_073)We don't just change. We 
continue on from that point.

## POINTER 110
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_074)Such wishful thinking...

## POINTER 111
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA000_075)Humph. Call it whatever you want.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA000_076)So? Are you gonna 
give up, or not?

## POINTER 112
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_077)I will press on with my 
own path for as long 
as I have strength.

## POINTER 113
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA000_078)Too bad...

## POINTER 114
Duke
<VOICE>(VA000_079)I have no regrets. 
I will die for that end. 
My friend...grant me your strength!

## POINTER 115

Phaeroh saw in you...

## POINTER 116

in the ten years since that war.

## POINTER 118

## POINTER 122

<VOICE>(VA000_095)My feelings for this world give me strength.

## POINTER 123
<STR>(JUD)

You want to keep those
