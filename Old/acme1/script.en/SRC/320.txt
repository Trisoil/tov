Hey old man, sorry to 
have dragged you all 
the way out here.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Whoa, what's with that face?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Hearin' you apologize like 
that puts me a little bit 
on edge, is all.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
I mean, you still have 
to deliver that letter 
to Belius, right?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Yeah, but if I can't see her until the 
new moon, then that's that, ain't it?<PAGE>Till then, I'm at the mercy 
of the princess's whims.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Well well, aren't you easygoing.<PAGE>You sure about that? If we spend too 
long out here and you miss the new moon, 
the Don'll yell at you for sure.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Meh, I'm used to bein' yelled 
at. If I gotta wait, I can wait 
until the next new moon.<PAGE>It ain't like we're gonna run 
out of new moons anytime soon.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
You certainly sound patient. 
You sure about this?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Of course. Patience 
is something you'll 
learn with age.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Ugh, I swear...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
Well, making the right decisions 
is part of being an adult, too.<PAGE>I'll leave as soon as 
I feel like I have to.<PAGE>Anyway, let me travel with you 
kids for a while longer.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Sure. Whatever you want.
