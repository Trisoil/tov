Can I ask you a question? 
Does Fortune's Market

We do, but... If you'd like to sell 
that, you'd be better off going directly 
to a store than talking to me.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
No, I don't want to sell it... I wanted 
to see if maybe I could see other 
spears that have been sold to you.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
You're still trying to find that 
spear of yours, aren't you?

## POINTER 4

It seems you have some personal stake in this, 
but I don't think it's been sold to us.<PAGE>If any of our vendors received any 
valuable items, no matter what they 
are, I would've heard of it.<PAGE>And I haven't heard anything...
