Toth
I remember you from before. 
What can I do for you today?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
I'd like you to teach me the
magic known as Astion.

## POINTER 2
Toth
You've heard of Astion? I'm
impressed. But unfortunately,
I cannot teach it to you.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Isn't the some way...? We 
want to do what we can 
to stop the Adephagos!

## POINTER 4
Toth
But you see...<PAGE>Oh, that Bush Baby 
doll you have...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, this...we got it from 
the elder of Myorzo.

## POINTER 6
Toth
Hmmm...alright, then let's have a trade. I'll
teach you Astion if you'll give me that.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Huh? Really truly?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
Huh? But we can't...!

## POINTER 9
Toth
That doll is an extremely valuable 
item to the Kritya.<PAGE>It was originally used in the 
ceremony to honor Krones.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Krones...?

## POINTER 11
Toth
Krones is the name of the one who carries Myorzo.<PAGE>To the Kritya of Myorzo, Krones is a being 
held sacred above all others. That's why 
that doll you have is so important.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
...The Elder sure handed it over without much of a fuss, didn't he?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
We might as well, right? If all we have 
to do is give him that little trinket.

## POINTER 14
Toth
"That little trinket"...?<PAGE>That is blatant disrespect 
towards the Bush Baby 
doll! Take that back!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, geez...I'm sorry.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, it's no skin off our backs. 
Come on <STR>(EST_P), hand it over.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
B-but... It's 
so cute!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
What are you talking about? This thing's 
our ticket to learning that magic!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
I'd rather have this cute little doll than some stupid magic spell...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Stop being such a baby 
and give me the doll!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
You know, they say that sometimes dolls 
have powerful curses on them that 
affect anyone who touches them.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
Eek...!

## POINTER 23
Toth
Simply amazing. I never thought the day would 
come when I would lay hands on this doll.<PAGE>...Now then, this is for you.<PAGE>All of the details about Astion
are written in this book.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
Ohhh, how could you trick me like that...?!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
Come on, grow up a little.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
Hmmm, this seems like it's 
<STR>(EST_P)'s kind of magic.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(EST_P)
What...? My kind of...?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RIT)
Read through that by tomorrow 
and see if you can learn it.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
...Why do you say it's <STR>(EST_P)'s kind of magic?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
The formula's interesting because it's 
so old, but it's really too bad...

## POINTER 31
<STR>(KAR)
?

## POINTER 32
<STR>(RIT)
I dunno, it's just a very simple kind 
of magic. Frumpy, if you will.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
So you gave it to <STR>(EST_P) 
because it's boring?

## POINTER 34
<STR>(RIT)
Th-that's not a very nice way to put it! Some people are just 
more naturally inclined towards certain types of things!

## POINTER 35
<STR>(KAR)
...You're terrible...
