So, word has it that you've been 
going around doing something or another 
to the world's Entelexeia.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Y-you make it 
sound so bad...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
We've been getting Entelexeia to change into 
a different form, called elemental spirits.<PAGE>This lets us borrow their power, which 
will help us to break up the Adephagos.

## POINTER 3

Oh ho, I see...it 
is as I thought.<PAGE>Indeed, I suspected that 
you would be working to 
defeat the Adephagos.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Again with the impressive claims...

## POINTER 5

I am correct, am I not?<PAGE>Perhaps it would interest you to know that our people 
have been considering going down to the surface.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
Going down to the surface...?

## POINTER 7

The time may soon come for Krones, 
the Entelexeia who carries 
Myorzo through the air,<PAGE>to turn into an elemental spirit and help 
your cause. Do you not think that likely?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
I'll admit it's certainly 
a possibility.

## POINTER 9

The less patient among us have already 
gone down to the surface.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
...? Where did they go?

## POINTER 11

I do not know. Though 
I would imagine they'd 
be hard to miss.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
I wonder where they went.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
You can already find Krityans in 
just about any city in the world.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
Krityans can live anywhere. 
They're a very practical 
people.

## POINTER 15

Mmph.
