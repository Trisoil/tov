Phew, looks like we lost 'em.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
*Huff* *huff* <STR>(RIT), you 
should really think more 
before you act!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
*Huff* ...That barrier blastia 
was just so strange, I couldn't 
help myself...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Strange? Something fishy about it?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
I have a feeling that may 
be an understatement.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Well, our hands are already full as it is, 
so could you please keep us out of it?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
...It doesn't concern 
you, regardless.

## POINTER 7
Leblanc
<STR>(YUR) Looowell! Where have 
you run off to now?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, Mr. Famous, sounds like you've got a fan out there.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Again? That guy gives a new meaning 
to the word "workaholic."

## POINTER 10
Adecor
Lady Estelliiiise! I say, 
do come out of hiding!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
You guys have a lot of problems! 
Just who are you, anyway?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Umm, well, I'm...

## POINTER 13
Boccos
Yuuuri, come out, come out, wherever you are!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
You can talk about that later!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
Waaaah! Wait, 
wait! It's me!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
...Ack, <STR>(KAR)...don't 
frighten us like that!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Anyway, let's get our butts to Nor Harbor 
before things get any more complicated.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
Which way were we supposed 
to go, again?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
Let's see, as the crow flies...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Isn't this a beast trail? Can 
we really go through here?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
We'll go as far as we can go, at least. 
I don't want to get captured again.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
We'll need to be on the lookout for monsters, then.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Meh, what are one or 
two monsters to the brave 
Captain <STR>(KAR)?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
Y-yeah, that's right!<PAGE>Though if the barrier were up, we wouldn't 
have to worry about monsters at all...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
I can't stand it! Why does some idiot 
have to go around breaking blastia 
and making our lives difficult?!
