Huh...? That's 
strange.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
What's the matter, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
...It looks like I dropped my wallet somewhere.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
At a time like this?!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Maybe it fell out of my pocket 
at the Don's place? I'm going 
to go look. You wait here.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
O-okay. Don't 
take too long!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
All righty. Now to go and see 
how <STR>(FRE)'s holding up...
