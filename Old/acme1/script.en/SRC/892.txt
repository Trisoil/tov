You never learn, do you? 
All right, you're on!

## POINTER 1

Oh, you came again! Can I ask you to help 
with some things around the tavern?

## POINTER 2

Hold on, who are 
all these people?

## POINTER 3

Oh, Mimi! Did you 
just get back?

## POINTER 4
Mimi
That's right. I have some 
free time again, so I thought 
I'd come and help out.<PAGE>What's this I hear about new 
uniformed employees helping 
you with work around here?!

## POINTER 5

Calm down, Mimi. I didn't know when 
you'd come back, so I was just getting 
them to help out until you did.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
It's not like we've been trying 
to take your job or anything. 
You don't have to get so mad.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
There's no need to 
argue, right? Let's 
be friends!

## POINTER 8
Mimi
No way! We need to 
settle this, now!

## POINTER 9

Once that girl gets 
going, she's deaf 
to reason...

## POINTER 10
Mimi
All right? Okay, then we'll have 
a competition to see who's the better 
server! Put on your uniforms!
