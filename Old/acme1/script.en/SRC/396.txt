## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS36_284)I might not fully understand 
the things the Don wanted 
to tell me yet.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_285)But Brave Vesperia is

I've gotta come with you guys!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_286)<STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS36_287)I think if I ran away... If I 
abandoned my friends, that'd be 
the end! I couldn't come back...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_288)That's why...that's why I've gotta 
go! Please let me come, too!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)

boss of this outfit, Captain.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS36_290)<STR>(YUR)! Thanks!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_291)But... Don't call me

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS36_293)I...I haven't done 
anything to earn that 
title yet...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_294)Until you really 
think I'm a boss...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_295)Until I donâ€™t feel embarrassed 
when someone calls me "boss"...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_296)I'll just do my part 
as a fellow member 
of Brave Vesperia.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_297)...Understood, <STR>(KAR). 
Not a bad plan.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS36_298)Alright!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS36_299)It never ends with these guilds. 
Bunch of hot-headed idiots.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_300)Hmm, yeah. Quite juvenile, isn't it?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS36_301)Aaah! H-hey old man...?!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_302)Ahh, how glorious is youth?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_303)What are you up to?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_304)Huh? Somethin' wrong 
with my bein' here?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_305)Well, don't you have your hands full,
with the Don's passing and everything...?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_306)Ya know, it all just seemed a little 
too bothersome, so I ducked out.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS36_307)But you owe a lot to the 
Don. Aren't you sad?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_308)Sad? I cried and cried till 
my throat was hoarse and there 
wasn't a tear left in me.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS36_309)Funny, it doesn't 
show on you at all.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_310)Heh, so not even <STR>(RAV) the 
Great can bear to ignore the 
Don's parting words.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_311)Wh-what're you talkin' about? 
Ya heard me, didn't ya? That 
burden's too heavy for this beast.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_312)I'm sure they'll be able ta take 
care of that piece of business 
just fine without me.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_313)All right, we'll 
leave it at that.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_314)Oh man... These 
kids today, I tell ya.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_315)So now we can depart 
for Desier, right?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS36_316)Huh? Why are we going back there?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_317)That's a pretty good hunch 
ya had there. Mt. Temza's 
north of the Sands of Kogorh.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_318)There's a Krityan city there, 
if memory serves.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS36_319)And why would you know 
something like that?

## POINTER 32
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_320)Well I'm over twice your 
age, so of course I 
know twice as many things.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS36_321)Right...

## POINTER 34
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_322)So are we goin' or aren't we?

## POINTER 35
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS36_323)Can we get to the north 
of Kogorh by boat?

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_324)Guess we'll have to see 
when we get there.
