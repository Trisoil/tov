Heracles...! Alexei brought 
out the big guns, I see.

<STR>(JUD)
...That's the Entelexeia, 
Astal.<PAGE>Alexei's still trying to 
get apatheia, it seems.

<STR>(RIT)
It looked like it got away, though.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, it looked like it was 
forced into those ruins.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
Those ruins definitely

<STR>(KAR)
I wonder what Alexei's 
plotting this time.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
It doesn't matter 
what Alexei's planning 
to do.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Right. We're just here 
to rescue <STR>(EST_P).
