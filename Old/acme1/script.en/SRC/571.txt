Oh! Her necklace...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Ah...!

## POINTER 2

Wh-what is it?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, can you tell me how 
you got that thing you're 
wearing around your neck?

## POINTER 4

Oh, this? I found it by the riverside.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Aha, just as we thought!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Is there any way you'd consider 
giving it to us?<PAGE>The original owner's sent us to come looking for it.

## POINTER 7

But I...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
Now, be a bit more accommodatin'. If it's money, 
we'll reimburse ya however much ya want.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, old man, whose money are you talking about...!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
Oh, don't throw a hissy.

## POINTER 11

Well... I couldn't accept money for it.<PAGE>But you know, I guess I'd be
willing to part with this if you
gave me a small bird feather.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
All right, well then...

## POINTER 13

Hold it!

## POINTER 14

I'll be taking that necklace. 
Even if I have to use force...<PAGE>No, I mustn't use force. Perhaps I'll 
persuade her to give it to me.<PAGE>But I won't let 
you all have it!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
She's already told us 
that she'll exchange it for 
a small bird feather, buddy...

## POINTER 16

Well then if I get here 
with that small bird feather 
first, will you give it to me?

## POINTER 17

I don't care which one of you gets it. I'll give the 
necklace to the first person who brings a small bird feather to me.

## POINTER 18

All right, I'm off. Farewell!<PAGE>Dash...!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
And he's gone, just like that. 
What a busy little man.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
We shouldn't loiter around waiting 
for him to beat us to it. Let's go!
