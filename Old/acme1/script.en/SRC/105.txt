<VOICE>(VS05_062)You there, how about coming 
to work for me? 
You'll be paid, of course.

## POINTER 1

<VOICE>(VS05_063)Watch your manners around the 
President. Well, whaddya say?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_064)So it's not bad manners to 
try and buy someone without 
even introducing yourself?

## POINTER 3

<VOICE>(VS05_065)Watch your mouth!

## POINTER 4

<VOICE>(VS05_066)You're just as charming as I 
expected. I'm Kaufman of the 
merchants' guild, Fortune's Market.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_067)We handle everything from 
trade to distribution.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_068)Guilds, huh...

## POINTER 6
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS05_069)You see, I'm in quite a tight spot, and 
it's all thanks to these tremors.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_070)I'd rather not know, but was 
that the work of a monster?

## POINTER 8
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS05_071)Yes, the Lord of the Plains.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_072)Lord of the Plains?

## POINTER 10
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS05_073)He's the leader of that pack of monsters.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_074)The leader? Man, there's some 
amazing things out there.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_075)Do you know if there's another 
way we can cross the plains? 
We're in a hurry.

## POINTER 13
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS05_076)Hmm, I'm afraid you'll just have to wait 
for the Lord of the Plains to leave.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_077)Huh. I guess there's no point 
getting worked up over it.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_078)But I can't afford to just 
sit and wait. I'm going to 
get a second opinion!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAP)
<VOICE>(VS05_079)......

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_080)You're with a guild that does 
product distribution, but you 
don't know any other routes?

## POINTER 18
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS05_081)I could hire you and just charge 
through once the leader moves on, 
but...you don't seem interested.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_082)If it's bodyguards you want, 
why not hire the Knights?

## POINTER 20
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS05_083)Are you forgetting that we guild 
members have thrown away our 
rights as imperial citizens?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_084)Once leave the empire behind, 
you can't expect them to help 
you a whole lot.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_085)So naturally, the Imperial Knights would 
never deign to escort the likes of us.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_086)Wow. You really stick 
to your principles.

## POINTER 22
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS05_087)Without that level of determination, 
one could never hope to run a guild.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_088)Well, maybe you could use your 
determination to do something 
about that Lord of the Plains.

## POINTER 24
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS05_089)Go to the Quoi Woods that 
lie to the west of here.

## POINTER 25
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS05_090)If you pass through the forest, you'll 
come out on the far side of the plains.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_091)But the fact that you guys 
aren't going that way...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_092)...must mean we have some surprise 
to look forward to.

## POINTER 27
Kaufman
<VOICE>(VS05_093)I like a boy with quick wits, but I 
like one that doesn't waste a 
potential investment even better.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_094)Thanks, I owe you one.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_095)Maybe I'll talk to you about 
that job if we meet again.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_096)<STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 30
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_097)I...I'm not waiting around for 
the monsters to leave or anything. 
I'm just resting a little.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_098)Oh, I see. Well then, I guess 
I'll just have to take the other 
way around by myself.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_099)What? How did you...? 
Hey, wait for me!
