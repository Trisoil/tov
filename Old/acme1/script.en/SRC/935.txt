I, I never thought 
you'd be able 
to beat that...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Give up already! We're 
just going to beat anything 
you throw at us!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
Not that you had anythin' ta do with it, <STR>(RIT)...

## POINTER 3

Darn it...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Are you convinced yet? 
Both Krones and Ba'ul have 
their strong points.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
That's right. There's 
no need for them to compete 
with each other.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
You should've stuck to that argument in the first place...

## POINTER 7

All right. I 
admit defeat.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Really? You finally 
get it!

## POINTER 9

Actually...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
What?

## POINTER 11

Actually, I was jealous 
of you and your dragon!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
How childish of ya... But I guess 
yer a child, after all...

## POINTER 13

I mean, it's, it's so 
cool! Soaring up high 
through the air!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Ahh, I know how 
you feel...

## POINTER 15

Hey, come back and play 
again soon! I want 
to see Ball again!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
It's Ba'ul.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
All right. After things settle 
down a bit, I'll let you fly 
around on top of Ba'ul.

## POINTER 18

Really truly?
Awesome! 
I'll be waiting!<PAGE>Don't forget! I'll 
be waiting here, "Super 
Dragon Rider!"
