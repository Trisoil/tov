Hey, it's him!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
Hmm...? H-hey there, long time no see.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Isn't there something else you should be saying?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Something else? Hmm, can't 
think of anything.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Well, they say the deceived have better 
memories than the deceivers, don't they?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
I'm just terribly misunderstood, honest!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
You need to see a doctor for your tendency 
to unconsciously cause trouble to others.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Ya might see if ya can get that foul 
mouth of yours checked out, too.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Got a comeback for everything, huh? 
If you don't stop putzing around, the 
Knights are gonna throw you back in jail!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Heh, the Knights are a bit 
too busy to bother with me.<PAGE>I saw a rough-looking guild group moving 
to the northwest not too long ago.<PAGE>The Knights can't just turn a 
blind eye to them, can they?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
...Rough-looking, you say? 
Was it the Blood Alliance?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
Beats me.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
By the way,  what was 
your business back there?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
Nothing special.
I was looking for an "apatheia".

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
What is an "apatheia?"

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
Supposed to be like
a really strong core.<PAGE>Heard that it was there 
but I guess I had 
the wrong information.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
I see... an "apatheia..."

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
Oh! <STR>(YUR)! 
Hey, over here!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
Argh, I'll get you, old man!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
Hmm, maybe I'd best be off, now.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
Yep. The Amazoness has emerged.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
Wait, damn it! I'm gonna 
beat you senseless!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
*Huff* *huff* Why'd you 
let him get away?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
He said he's terribly misunderstood.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
What? What does 
that mean...?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
...He got away. I'll catch that 
bugger one of these days...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
You should leave him be. Going 
up against that kind of guy is 
just a waste of energy.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
You all right?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
...Just let me...take a...little break.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
Sure, you can have a little 
one. Then we've gotta go.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(KAR)
Go? Go where?

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
We need to follow the Blood 
Alliance to get back the lower 
quarter's blastia.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(EST_P)
Did you get a lead on where to go next?

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
I heard that a shady group from 
a guild was headed to the northwest. 
It might be them.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(KAR)
To the northwest of here...the only city 
I can think of in that direction would be 
one that was destroyed in an earthquake.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(EST_P)
What could they want to 
do in a place like that?

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
Hmm, good question.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(RIT)
And yet you still want to go?

## POINTER 38
<STR>(YUR)
I'm just saying we should go and check it out.
