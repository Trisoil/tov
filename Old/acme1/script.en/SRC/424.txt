<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS40_037)Do you think we should 
really just go in?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_038)He's the one who told us 
to wait for him here.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_039)I guess the Krityans 
really are different.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS40_040)They don't seem ta be in 
any great rush ta get 
things done, that's for sure.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_041)I know. They certainly 
are weird, aren't they?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_042)Actually, you're kind of 
like that too, <STR>(JUD).

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_043)That's funny. I don't 
see that at all.

## POINTER 7

<VOICE>(VS40_044)Ah, there you are.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS40_045)W-welcome back.

## POINTER 9

<VOICE>(VS40_046)I've kept you waiting. 
Now, please step 
this way if you will.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_047)...?

## POINTER 11

<VOICE>(VS40_048)This is the very means 
by which the lore of 
Myorzo is passed on.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS40_049)But, um...it's just a wall.

## POINTER 13

<VOICE>(VS40_050)<STR>(JUD). Use the nageeg 
as you touch the wall, 
and repeat these words:<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_051)...City of dreams veiled in 
mist, reality's extension.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_052)City of dreams veiled in 
mist, reality's extension...?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_053)What's happening?

## POINTER 16

<VOICE>(VS40_054)We Krityans possess an ancient 
power known as the nageeg that 
reveals the stories hidden in objects.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_055)These murals appear only 
when this power is joined 
with the proper incantation.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_056)Th-this painting is kind of creepy...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_057)The Kritya. Stewards of wisdom, 
founders of the mighty Geraios, 
and ancient sages.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_058)Our misbegotten wisdom has 
sown only the seeds of ruin.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_059)The blastia we created granted 
us blessings, but also blighted 
the aer, lifeblood of this world.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS40_060)Then <STR>(RIT) was right. 
There were disturbances 
in the aer in the past.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_061)You think this is showing 
a disturbance in the aer?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_062)It looks more like 
the aer is trying 
to...eat the planet.

## POINTER 22

<VOICE>(VS40_063)Hmm. It is said that a great 
mass of aer threatened to 
swallow the very planet whole.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_064)The blight grew ever 
stronger and brought 
forth a cataclysm...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_065)In our terror, we gave 
a name to the cataclysm: 
the Adephagos.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS40_066)Adephagos...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_067)The world united to challenge 
the Adephagos, and banish the 
loathsome power which created it.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_068)Hey, could that be 
the Entelexeia?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS40_069)It does look a bit like 
monsters and humans fightin' 
somethin' off together.

## POINTER 28

<VOICE>(VS40_070)Though the Geraios civilization 
was lost, the Adephagos was 
quelled in the end.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_071)The fact that we are all 
still here today is 
evidence enough of that.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_072)So then is this painting 
showing the Adephagos being 
brought under control?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_073)Hey, what's the last thing it says there.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_074)<STR>(JUD_P)?

## POINTER 32
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_075)Hearing the world's prayers, life faded 
from the Child of the Full Moon. The 
Adephagos disappeared into the void.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_076)What?!

## POINTER 34
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS40_077)The world's prayers... 
Life faded from the Children 
of the Full Moon...

## POINTER 35
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_078)Our world was preserved. 
But the story shall remain here 
for generations to tell of our sin.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_079)240th year of Asule.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_080)What's that supposed to mean?

## POINTER 37

<VOICE>(VS40_081)There is no further 
explanation of what each 
of these phrases may mean.

## POINTER 38

<VOICE>(VS40_082)Our ancestors created the 
blastia which led to the 
downfall of their entire civilization.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_083)They then chose to abandon 
the blastia and sever their 
ties with the outside world.

## POINTER 39
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_084)<STR>(EST_P)!

## POINTER 40
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_085)Let her go.

## POINTER 41

<VOICE>(VS40_086)This is all the 
lore of Myorzo.

## POINTER 42
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_087)Thanks. You've given 
us a lot to think about.

## POINTER 43

<VOICE>(VS40_088)You know what's helpful? There's 
this magic cucumber that'll turn 
any dish into a gourmet meal...

## POINTER 44
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_089)I think we'll pass. Could 
we trouble you for a 
place to rest a while?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_090)I feel we may need to impose 
on you until our friend 
has calmed down.

## POINTER 45

<VOICE>(VS40_091)Hmph.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_092)You are free to use the 
house next door. No 
one lives there right now.

## POINTER 46
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_093)Thank you. Okay, 
let's be going.
