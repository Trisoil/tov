<VOICE>(VS15_145)Well, well, what do we have here? More 
delicious snacks for my pet, it seems.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_146)So you're Ragou? 
You've got some pretty 
disgusting hobbies.

## POINTER 2
Ragou
<VOICE>(VS15_147)Hobbies? Oh, you must 
mean my basement.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS15_148)Only someone with my refined 
sensibilities could understand the 
pleasure I derive from such things.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS15_149)You're just like those senile old fools on 
the council. They bored me to death 
and never let me enjoy myself.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS15_150)It's the privilege of my exalted station 
to dispel such boredom with the...help 
of the common people.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS15_151)You can't mean that's your only 
reason to do those things.

## POINTER 4
Ragou
<VOICE>(VS15_152)Well, I suppose I should 
go and fetch Rhybgaro.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS15_153)So many new toys... He ought 
to put on quite a show. Though you 
may not live long enough to see it...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_154)There's no point in searching for Rhybgaro. 
We've already taken care of him.

## POINTER 6
Ragou
<VOICE>(VS15_155)...What did you say?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_156)Are you deaf? 
I said we've already 
taken care of him.

## POINTER 8
Ragou
<VOICE>(VS15_157)You... What have you done to my pet?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_158)If you'd put a bell on it or 
something, maybe you wouldn't 
have lost track of it.

## POINTER 10
Ragou
<VOICE>(VS15_159)Ah well, with a bit more money, I'll 
soon be able to replace him.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS15_160)Ragou! How can you say such 
things and still call yourself 
a servant of the empire?!

## POINTER 12
Ragou
<VOICE>(VS15_161)What? ...You... 
But that's impossible!

## POINTER 13
Ragou
<VOICE>(VS15_163)S-stay back! W-what do 
you intend to do?!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS15_164)Someone! Arrest 
these intruders!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_165)We'll have enemies all over 
the place if we don't hurry up 
and finish what we came to do!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_166)Hold it.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS15_167)...What? Don't we need to 
create an emergency for the 
Knights to respond to?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS15_168)It's still too soon. First 
we need some evidence.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS15_169)We've got to find the blastia 
that controls the weather.
