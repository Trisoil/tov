Hey old man, you can feel free to 
go on ahead to Nordopolica.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
Hey there, young'un. What, you 
wanna get rid of me so soon?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Wrong. I just wouldn't want you to miss 
the new moon and your chance to deliver 
the letter all on our account.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Honestly, I could do fine 
without your concern.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Wrong again.<PAGE>If Brave Vesperia gets in the way 
of Altosk's work, we'll be apologizing 
to the Don for an eternity.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
What? You're too young to bother 
yourself with such fluff.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
It's a matter of Brave Vesperia being 
trustworthy. You see what I mean?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
We've still got time 
left until the new moon. 
We'll be fine.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
You sure...?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Anyway, I ain't about to go back through 
the desert and that cave myself!<PAGE>If I got killed by some monster 
on the way there, not only would 
the letter not get delivered,<PAGE>but Brave Vesperia certainly wouldn't 
look very trustworthy to potential 
clients then, would they?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
In that case, we'd collect your 
bones and the letter, and deliver 
them as promised.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
Oh, how kind of...<PAGE>...Wait, hey!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Anyway, just so long as you won't 
go blaming me if you don't manage 
to deliver it on time.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
No problem!â™ª
