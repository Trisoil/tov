What's up, Brave 
Vesperia?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Looks like you finally 
remembered who we are.

## POINTER 2

Well, of course I have. Got 
something here with your 
name on it, after all.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
What?

## POINTER 4

Don't get too excited, now. 
It's from one of the lieutenants 
in the Imperial Knights.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
I wonder what it could be.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
Huh? Who's it from?

## POINTER 7

Oh yeah, there's a note attached.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Let's see... "Dear Brave Vesperia, 
We hope this finds you succeeding 
in all your ventures..."

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Skip that part. 
What do they want?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Uh, okay... "Thank you for your 
cooperation in the recent 
arrest of anti-Empire elements."<PAGE>"Due in part to your aid, a plot 
to overthrow the government 
has been averted."<PAGE>"Financial compensation of any 
guild by the Imperial Knights 
is strictly forbidden."<PAGE>"On behalf of myself and my two 
subordinates however, I humbly 
offer you our heartfelt thanks."<PAGE>"I look forward to future cooperation 
between our parties. Good fortune 
and good health. -Leblanc"

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
...!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
My my, how gentlemanly.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Future cooperation? 
What is he thinking we're 
going to cooperate on?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Huh, back from the job 
we did for Mimula...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
I guess this'll have to take the 
place of payment for that job.

## POINTER 16

It's none of my business, but it's a 
pretty big deal for the Knights to send 
anything like this to Dahngrest.<PAGE>There're folks around here who'd rather 
not draw the Empire's attention. Do 
make sure and watch yourselves.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
No worries, it's nothing 
like that.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Feels pretty nice to finally 
get some recognition for 
our hard work, huh <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, let's hope we 
can keep this up.
