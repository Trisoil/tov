So does an ol' man past his prime 
fit into the picture at all?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
What're you whining 
about, old man? Why are 
you past your prime?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
Mmmm. What <STR>(JUD) was talkin' 
about before--Hermes blastia, 
was it?<PAGE>Blastia created with techniques 
that should've been lost in the 
war are still active...<PAGE>Do you know what 
this means?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
...I guess someone who survived 
the war brought either blastia or 
those techniques back with him.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
If that person was still usin' 
the blastia even though he knew 
it was harmful ta the earth...<PAGE>Someone like that...would have 
to be quite the villain indeed.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Old man, don't tell me you...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
Hey now. Yours truly was nothing 
but an innocent youth on the 
straight and narrow back then.<PAGE>I wouldn't do something like 
that even on my worst day.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Heh, I was just trying to trick 
you into giving yourself away. 
You're a slippery one!

Son of a...when're ya gonna learn 
some respect for yer elders!
