Thank you so much!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Meow!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Make sure you don't let her run away again!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Meow!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
What's all this meowing mean, 
anyway?! I don't get it!!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
You did well, <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
Hey, it was a team effort!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Where'd you come 
from back there, 
<STR>(EST_P)?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
Where'd I come from? I just went around the back, 
then I got in through the second-story window.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
...The second-story window? 
You climbed up to there?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, that's not half bad, <STR>(EST_P)!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
Well, it was your 
idea to use a pincer 
technique, <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
But it was your idea to come 
in from a back exit, <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Well, that was only because I was so 
moved by your selfless desire to help 
that nice lady get her cat back.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
...Who, me? Nah, I was 
just doing it for fun.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
It's okay, <STR>(RIT), you don't have to pretend. 
You're a good person! I can tell.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
No, you've got me all wrong... Well... 
I guess it's not worth arguing about...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
If <STR>(RIT)'s a good person, what 
does that make <STR>(EST_P)...?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
People can be good in their own ways, I think...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
...Couldn't've said it better myself.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
You guys are so 
full of it...
