<STR>(YUR)...<PAGE>Thank you... for um,
saving... <STR>(FRE).<PAGE>...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
You guys go on ahead first.
I'll catch up.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
I'm not gonna
tell anyone.

## POINTER 3
Sodia
...Why?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Because I can understand
why you tried to kill me 
back there.<PAGE>There's something you just want to protect,
even if it means dirtying your own hands.<PAGE>You lose your senses in the heat
of the moment and find yourself
doing things you'd never imagine.

## POINTER 5
Sodia
...<PAGE>I know what I have 
done is unforgivable.<PAGE>It would have been easier
if you'd blame me for this.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Don't flatter yourself!<PAGE>Don't think I'm here doing
this for your own good.<PAGE>I'm not going to put the blame on you
just so you can ease your conscience.

## POINTER 7
Sodia
W-what...should I do...?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
I have no intention of
lecturing you about
rights and wrongs.<PAGE>Go figure it out yourself.

## POINTER 9
Sodia
...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
If you can't, go ask someone
you can talk to about this.
But, not me.<PAGE>As <STR>(FRE)'s friend, I'm grateful for
the loyalty you've shown towards him.

Uh...
