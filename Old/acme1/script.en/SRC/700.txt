Hey! It's the healer girl!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Hi!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
The tree's flowers look as 
red as ever... Too bad about 
that bride's curse...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm pretty sure that's 
wrong, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Wrong...? What's wrong?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
This veil... 
It told me...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
Once upon a time, there 
lived a kind-hearted 
prince named Jarre.<PAGE>He adored flowers and insects, 
and he loved the moon, the sun, 
and the stars up in the sky.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
One day, Jarre found a seed. 
He took that seed to the top of 
a great hill, and planted it there.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
In time, the seed sprouted, and 
became a long, thin trunk of a tree. 
But its flowers did not bloom.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
The impatient Prime Minister said, 
"What's the point if it won't bloom. 
Cut it down." But Jarre replied:

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
"Even if it doesn't bloom, it's putting 
all of its effort into growing. Cutting 
it down would be a terrible thing to do!"

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
Hearing this, the tree took 
the form of a young woman, 
and appeared before Jarre.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
He instantly fell in love with her white 
skin and beautiful figure. On a moonlit 
night, he asked her to marry him.<PAGE>After their wedding, 
the two of them were 
as happy as can be.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
But the Prime Minister, angry that the 
Prince had married the maiden, had 
her cruelly cast out of the castle.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
Jarre was so sad that he shut himself up in 
the castle. Day and night he cried, unable 
to think of anything but his lost love.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
The maiden learned of this, and stretched 
her trunk and branches until several pure, 
white flowers bloomed from their tips.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
Jarre saw this from his castle window and 
stopped crying. He went outside for the 
first time since his maiden had gone.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
Sitting beneath the newly 
bloomed flowers, he 
heard the maiden's voice.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
"Don't cry. You'll always 
be able to find me here."<PAGE>It was then that Jarre realized that 
his love had actually been the tree, 
transformed into a fair maiden.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
When he gently kissed the bark of 
the tree he had loved, all of its 
flowers turned to a bright red.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
And that is why this tree's 
flowers symbolize eternal love, 
permanent and unchanging.

## POINTER 21

Wow... So that's why 
the flowers are red!

## POINTER 22

So that's the 
real story!

## POINTER 23

Miss, thank you for 
the wonderful story!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
No, it was my pleasure.

## POINTER 25

You should tell that 
story to the Mayor, too!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(KAR)
Wow, I didn't know 
about all that, <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, when did you 
find all that out?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
W-well... I didn't find 
out about it, exactly... 
I sort of...made it up.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
But you said the 
veil told you...

## POINTER 30
<STR>(EST_P)
That was a lie. 
I'm sorry...<PAGE>I was just looking at this 
veil, and the story came 
to me all of a sudden...

## POINTER 31
<STR>(KAR)
Wow, <STR>(EST_P)! You have a real 
talent for making up stories!

## POINTER 32
<STR>(JUD)
A hidden talent, huh? 
Will wonders never cease...

## POINTER 33
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, heh heh...

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
You ever think about becoming 
a writer of children's stories?

## POINTER 35
<STR>(EST_P)
N-not really...

## POINTER 36
<STR>(RAV)
You can't force 
her inta somethin' 
like that!

## POINTER 37
<STR>(KAR)
After all, <STR>(EST_P), 
you're the Princess!â™ª

## POINTER 38
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, that's true.

## POINTER 39
<STR>(EST_P)
...Children's stories, hmmm... 
Maybe it wouldn't hurt to at least 
give it some thought...right?
