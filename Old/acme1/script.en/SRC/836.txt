in the port... Is she yours?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Oh, the...boat? Yes, it's 
ours. It used to belong 
to Miss Kaufman, but...

## POINTER 8
Sicily
I was wondering...
Is okay I upgrade it?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
You want to upgrade it...?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
N-no way! What if 
you mess it up and 
it stops working?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
Upgrade it, ya say... What do 
ya wanna do to it, anyway?

## POINTER 12
Sicily
There's just something I'd like 
to put onto it, capisce?<PAGE>I won't do anything bad 
to it! You have my word.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
You think we're just going 
to let you do who-knows-what 
to our ship...?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
......<PAGE>Hey, <STR>(YUR). Ya think we 
might just let 'im do it 
and see what happens?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
...Do you know something 
I don't, old man?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
Mmmm... Nah, not really. 
Jus' thought we might 
give 'im a chance.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
...Okay.
...Go ahead 
and do it.<PAGE>But if it doesn't work when you're 
through... We're going to tie you 
to the hull and give you a paddle.

## POINTER 18
Sicily
Sure! Okay! Grazie!<PAGE>Bene, bene, just wait 
here a little bit!

## POINTER 19
Sicily
Guarda! I have finished!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
There's...something 
attached to the ship...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
What did ya do?

## POINTER 22
Sicily
I attached a salvage 
arm for you!<PAGE>With this, you can collect 
treasures in the sea!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
What do you 
think, <STR>(RIT)?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
...It's been placed 
very well.<PAGE>The weight distribution and 
hull balance have been 
taken into account, too...<PAGE>This is just too perfect...

## POINTER 25
Sicily
I also adjusted the bottom, to 
get you through shallows that 
you could not traverse before.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(KAR)
W-wow...

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RAV)
Hey, how'd ya do all this?

## POINTER 28
Sicily
Oh, I've just been interested 
in le barche lately, is all.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RAV)
Wow, what a strange guy...

## POINTER 30
Sicily
Well, see you! 
Arrivederci!

## POINTER 31

W-was that Professor Sicily just now?

## POINTER 32
<STR>(RIT)
Huh? You know 
that guy?

## POINTER 33

Of course! They call 
him the Shining Star 
of Core Engineering!<PAGE>There's no one in the world 
who's better at manipulating 
blastia cores!

## POINTER 34
<STR>(EST_P)
Wow, that's amazing.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(JUD)
<STR>(RIT), you haven't heard of him?

## POINTER 36
<STR>(RIT)
No, I haven't.<PAGE>Blastia research has many subfields. 
I always researched how to use 
blastia to produce magical effects.<PAGE>But some blastia engineers develop new
applications for cores and their effects.
That's a totally different area of research.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(KAR)
Wow... Blastia engineers, eh? I'll bet 
the architects' guild would love to 
get their hands on someone like him.

## POINTER 38

That's right!<PAGE>The architects' guild is working 
frantically to find Professor 
Sicily and get his help!

## POINTER 39
<STR>(YUR)
This sounds like information Kaufman 
would be interested in...

## POINTER 40

But they say that he's rather eccentric, 
and he only works on projects that 
interest him at the time...

## POINTER 41
<STR>(RAV)
That sounds about right...

## POINTER 42
<STR>(YUR)
Ha ha. Let's go see just 
how useful that professor's 
eccentricity can be.

## POINTER 43
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah! Let's see what that 
salvage arm can do!

## POINTER 44
Information
A crane has been added
to the Fiertia. Lower the
arm near specific search
points to uncover hidden
items or Gald. You might
even discover some
other items.

## POINTER 45
Information
In addition, the ship has
been reinforced and now
you are able to travel
through shallow streams
you were unable to reach
before.
