Better stop plodding along like a zombie, 
or you'll only make yourself more tired!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
How are you in such good spirits?

## POINTER 2

Some people take pleasure 
in the suffering of 
others...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Why I oughta...

Don't waste your energy.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
That sort of peppiness simply isn't healthy... 
Hey, did you hear a voice?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
No...not at all...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
By the way, why 
were you in this 
desert before?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
I used to live in a town up in the 
mountains to the north of here. Together 
with my friend Ba'ul.<PAGE>So I sometimes came down 
near the desert.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
All the way to the desert...?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
Anyway, we hardly have time 
to look for anything out here, 
what with this heat...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Seriously...if we 
run out of water, 
we'll be goners...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
We need to find something 
like a clue soon...
