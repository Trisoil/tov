<STR>(FRE)
Hey, <STR>(RAP).

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RAP) really likes 
<STR>(FRE), doesn't he? 
He's so lucky...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Well, <STR>(RAP) also thinks 
of <STR>(FRE) as his owner.<PAGE>A long time ago, <STR>(FRE) and I used 
to look after <STR>(RAP) together.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Did <STR>(RAP) use to 
have such a cold 
personality?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, he did.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
So how did you and <STR>(FRE) 
get to be such good 
friends with him?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
We just took care of him.<PAGE>One time, <STR>(RAP) got hurt really badly. 
<STR>(FRE) and I stayed up all night tending
his wounds and making sure he was okay.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
Is that maybe how <STR>(RAP) 
got his scar?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Come to think of it, didn't you 
say that <STR>(RAP) got his blastia 
as a keepsake of his old owner?<PAGE>I wonder if his bodhi blastia 
has anything to do with the 
time that he got hurt...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm, good question.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
Were you the one who gave <STR>(RAP) his name?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, that was his last owner. <STR>(RAP) seems 
to like his own name, so I didn't really 
have the heart to give him a new one.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
You're so nice, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
Maybe <STR>(RAP)'s got a promise ta keep 
ta his old owner, and that's why he 
acts so unfriendly all the time.<PAGE>A hard-boiled hound who's still 
loyal ta his old owner...sounds 
pretty cool, dontcha think?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
He's playing with <STR>(FRE)!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
...Maybe he's just 
a big softy inside?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(FRE)
You've gotten so 
strong, <STR>(RAP)!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(FRE)
Take good care 
of <STR>(YUR), okay?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!
