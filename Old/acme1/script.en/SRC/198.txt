After all, I've heard that the 
Imperial Knights have made some 
repairs on the blastia here.

## POINTER 3

Give the Knights some credit 
for once, will you?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Please, <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
...All right then.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
It's okay for you to be wandering around like this?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes... But can I stay 
with you until it's time 
to return to Zaphias?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
I don't mind at all.
