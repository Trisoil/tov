<VOICE>(VS04_500)Man, it's bright.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_501)*Sigh* It's already morning. 
I wasted an entire night.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_502)Looks like it led to the royal quarter.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST)
<VOICE>(VS04_503)Everything looks so different 
from the windows of the castle.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_504)Ah, come on. You sound 
like this is your first time
out of the castle.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST)
<VOICE>(VS04_505)...Uh, well, I...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_506)I guess a lady who lives in a 
castle can't just take a walk 
outside whenever she wants.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST)
<VOICE>(VS04_507)Y-yes, you're right.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_508)Well, hey.  At least we
made it out of the castle.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_509)Hah hah hah...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST)
<VOICE>(VS04_510)Um. Was that not right?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_511)Nah...  It's fine...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS04_512)So <STR>(EST), what are you
gonna do now that you're out?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST)
<VOICE>(VS04_513)I'm going to find <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_514)Do you know where he went?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST)
<VOICE>(VS04_515)The other day, he said he was going 
off on a knight's pilgrimage.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_516)Ohh, that thing.  
Going around the cities of 
the empire piling up good deeds?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST)
<VOICE>(VS04_517)Yes. That's why I'm going to 
the City of Blossoms, Halure.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS04_518)Halure is the first place that knights 
traditionally visit on a pilgrimage.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_519)So you'll need to go outside the barrier.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST)
<VOICE>(VS04_520)Have you ever been 
beyond the barrier?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_521)Little while back. I'd like to go
but I can't just leave the 
lower quarter like it is.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS04_522)Come on. I'll show you the 
way out of town. It's on the 
way to the lower quarter.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST)
<VOICE>(VS04_523)Thank you!
