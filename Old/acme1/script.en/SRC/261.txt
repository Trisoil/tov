Do you have a dress for a
girl that will make her look 
extremely cute?

## POINTER 1

Extremely cute!?
Like something for a date?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Yeah, that's 
right. So...?

## POINTER 3

Let's see... Ummm...you're 
a boy, am I right?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Well, I don't look 
like a girl, do I?

## POINTER 5

Ah, well... Wait, why are 
you getting mad at me?<PAGE>Anyway, I don't carry 
any clothing for 
young girls.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
He says he doesn't have 
anything. Too bad!

## POINTER 7

Ah, hold on...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Huh...?

## POINTER 9

If you brought me a soft tail, basilisk 
scale and a small bird feather, 
I could make you something nice.

## POINTER 10

You should be able to get all of the items 
from monsters on the outskirts of the city.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
All right, let's go.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Do we really have to do 
all of this? It seems like 
so much trouble...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Captain <STR>(KAR), you wouldn't have 
us abandon your plan, would you?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
No... I mean, of course 
not, but...<PAGE>Argh, if only <STR>(RIT) were 
here right now...
