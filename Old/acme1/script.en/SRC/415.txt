Did you find out anything?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
We've got a lead in a place 
called Egothor Forest.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
I'm pretty sure it's on the west side
of Hypionia, to the south of here.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
So Myorzo's in 
that forest?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
No, but a door is.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Huh? A door? What do you mean?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
There's a door there that leads to Myorzo. It'd 
be fastest to just go and check it out.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
First...let me rest...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
Perhaps we should get some rest before leaving?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
But...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
We don't really have a choice.
