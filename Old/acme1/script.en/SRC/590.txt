Hey, you guys are... Brave Vesperia...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
How nice of you to remember.

## POINTER 2

The boss isn't here anymore.<PAGE>Yeah, no reason for you to come 
sniffing around here anymore.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Anybody named Sebastian 
come here lately?

## POINTER 4

Hmph. Never heard of him.

## POINTER 5

Wait. You know as well as 
I do we've got no idea what 
to do with that guy.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
Then he is here.

## POINTER 7

We kept him here under 
house arrest while Yeager 
was still with us.<PAGE>But to tell the truth, he's getting 
to be a waste of space, these days.

## POINTER 8

What're you saying? You're 
talking to Yeager's killers!

## POINTER 9

Yeager is dead and gone. 
We're gonna have to face 
facts sooner or later.<PAGE>But there's a condition.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Condition?

## POINTER 11

We're trying to start an alliance with 
a guild called the Soul Smiths.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Why would we want to do 
anything to help a bunch 
of arms smugglers?

## POINTER 13

Go ahead, try and force 
your way in, then!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
All righty, let's all play nice, now.

## POINTER 15

Hmph...

## POINTER 16

We need weapons to defend ourselves 
against the monsters, don't we?<PAGE>Without Yeager, it's all we 
can do to survive out here.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
...The Soul Smiths? Have 
you heard of them?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Of course I know them. They're one 
of the five master guilds, and they 
specialize in blacksmithing. <PAGE>But unlike the others, they keep 
pretty much to themselves.<PAGE>They built a forge deep inside a 
mountain, and they still live there, 
tucked away from the world.

## POINTER 19

That's it. We need somebody 
to find them for us.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
You want us to check every mountain 
on the planet? Yeah right.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
Who said old <STR>(RAV) didn't have at 
least a hunch up his sleeve, huh?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
No way!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Heh, leave it to the No. 2 guy in the Union. 
Guess this is a father-knows-best situation.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAV)
Don't tell me ya forgot your first client, 
Yu, already. He might be good ta chat with.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(KAR)
Th-that guy?!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
Would this face ever lie to you?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
So if we can get a hold of 
these Soul Smiths for you, 
you'll let the butler go?

## POINTER 28

Don't see why we couldn't.
