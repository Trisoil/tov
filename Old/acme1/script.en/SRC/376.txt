## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Does it look like it'll be okay?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Oh...well, it's pretty bad...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Geez, this isn't usable at all...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
...Damn it! I can't believe 
that <STR>(JUD) was...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
And all the time she was with us she 
didn't destroy any blastia at all.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Why was she with us 
in the first place?<PAGE>That dragon...Ba'ul, 
right?<PAGE>It attacked us back in 
Heliord, didn't it?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
You've got a 
good memory.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
That's not the sort of 
thing I easily forget.<PAGE>Do you think they were going 
after <STR>(EST_P) back then?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
Yes...she knew. She knew 
about <STR>(EST_P)...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
You didn't already know 
that she was that dragon-freak, 
did you?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
...Yeah.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Damn it, I can't believe you...!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
We all have our reasons 
for what we've done. 
<PAGE>You and <STR>(JUD) bothâ€¦

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
...You mean...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
And me too, of course.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
You mean Ragou and Cumore? Hmph, I don't 
care much about what happened to them.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(JUD_P) was a loyal member 
of our party.<PAGE>That's how it looked to me, at least...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah, that's true, but...<PAGE>If she had just shared what she knew about the Child 
of the Full Moon, and about the Entelexeia...<PAGE><STR>(EST_P)'s problems 
might already have 
been solved by now.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
It depends, doesn't it? 
Phaeroh told her she was 
poison, after all.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
...You know, it's possible 
she knew where Phaeroh was 
from the very beginning.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
...Yeah, maybe so.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
Either way, I'll never 
forgive her for breaking 
that blastia!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Well then, if <STR>(JUD_P) comes 
back, you can feel free 
to beat her up.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
...She's not coming 
back...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm, I couldn't say.
