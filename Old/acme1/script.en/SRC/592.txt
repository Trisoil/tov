Come on, move those feet!

## POINTER 1

...*Groan*.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, is that 
Sebastian?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
We've come with news about the Soul Smiths! 
So let Mr. Sebastian go, okay?

## POINTER 4

Huh? Do I know you?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
We had a deal, here.

## POINTER 6

No clue what you're talking about.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
They're just toying 
with us.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
But you said if we could make 
contact with the Smiths you'd 
let Mr. Sebastian go...

## POINTER 9

Oh, you must mean the guy who was here with 
me. There's only one thing that happens 
to losers like him in Leviathan's Claw.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Then you...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Okay, this guy's gotta go.

## POINTER 12

Watch that lip, boy! Let's 
see what you've got!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Hang in there. How do you feel?

## POINTER 14

W-who are all of you...?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
We're Brave Vesperia!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
You're Sebastian?

## POINTER 17

The very same. 
But how did 
you...?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
Your employer asked 
that we come and 
pick you up.

## POINTER 19
Sebastian
My lady sent you...? H-how 
very fortuitous.<PAGE>Oh, that's right. Do 
wait here a moment.

## POINTER 20
Sebastian
Here I am.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Whoa, hold on. What's 
with the luggage?

## POINTER 22
Sebastian
Oh, just something I nearly forgot.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
That's a pretty big something.

## POINTER 24
Sebastian
Honestly, pay it no mind. Well, 
I do owe you my thanks...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I smell fish too, boy.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
We're under no obligation to interfere in 
everything that seems a bit off, are we?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
I wonder.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
They do say the customer's always right, but...

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
At any rate, let's go collect our reward 
from our favorite noblewoman.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(KAR)
Y-yeah...
