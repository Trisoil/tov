<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_500)The cataclysm... The Adephagos...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_501)If that legend's true, then 
maybe the power of the 
Child of the Full Moon...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_502)...isn't the only thing 
to blame for bringing 
up the Adephagos.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS40_503)But what about the "hearing the 
world's prayers, life faded from the 
Children of the Full Moon" part?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_504)Maybe they averted danger by 
killing the cause of the Adephagos, 
the Children of the Full Moon.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_505)B-but, wait...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_506)...aren't the Hermes 
blastia the real cause? 
Can't we just stop those?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_507)It might not be just 
the Hermes blastia.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_508)That legend made it 
sound like all blastia 
disturb the world's aer.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_509)Right, <STR>(RIT)?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_510)The elder said that blastia 
are blastia. There are no 
normal ones or special ones.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_511)I think that means the only 
thing that's different is how 
much aer each formula uses.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_512)Even the blastia we're using?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_513)Bodhi blastia are special, but 
all blastia utilize aer in a 
formula. They're all the same...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_514)And formulas need 
aer to work.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_515)The Hermes technique, the 
Children of the Full Moon... They're 
probably only part of the danger.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_516)With more and more blastia, the 
Adephagos will awaken. This is 
what the Entelexeia are afraid of.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_517)That's what I was 
worried about.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_518)I didn't want to admit it...!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_519)Blastia couldn't be bad... 
The people who used them 
for evil were the bad ones.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_520)That's what I always believed... 
But...I was wrong.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_521)So does that mean we 
have to stop every blastia?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_522)Like the people 
here in Myorzo did?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS40_523)That's impossible. 
We need blastia for 
our everyday lives.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_524)Barrier blastia, aque blastia... 
Bodhi blastia, too.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_525)Yeah, you're right...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_526)I couldn't take on 
a really tough monster 
if I didn't have this.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_527)Yeah...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_528)I wish we could use 
blastia without worrying  
about consuming aer...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_529)But I guess that's 
just a dream.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_530)The Rizomata Formula...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_531)What's that?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_532)All things exist due to the 
sublimation, reduction, formation,
and dispersion of aer.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_533)Some think that a still undiscovered 
theory could freely manipulate 
those essential mechanisms of aer.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_534)Formulating that theory is the 
ultimate goal of current magical 
research by mages around the world.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_535)So that's the 
Rizomata Formula?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_536)If it's found, manipulating aer 
will become so much easier.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_537)Of course, we need a formula to 
reconstruct aer from power that 
was originally converted from aer...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_538)But <STR>(EST_P)'s power is actually 
directly manipulating aer.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_539)<STR>(EST_P) is the closest thing 
to the Rizomata Formula.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_540)If we can use a formula 
to interfere with and 
neutralize <STR>(EST_P)'s power...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_541)I don't really get it, but...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_542)...If you work out that 
formula thing, then <STR>(EST_P) 
can live in peace, right?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_543)So by that logic, if we could control 
the excess of aer, we could 
prevent provoking the Adephagos.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_544)Awesome!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS40_545)So, we're supposed to go looking 
for some formula that researchers 
all over the world can't find?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_546)Now you're really dreaming...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_547)I will figure out this formula!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_548)For <STR>(EST_P)! And for me!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS40_549)Yeah, you do that...

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_550)Huh? <STR>(RAV), where 
are you going?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS40_551)For a walk. All this talk about 
savin' the world, the ultimate 
goal of magical research...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_552)This conversation's a 
little much for ol' <STR>(RAV) 
to keep up with.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_553)That formula sounds nice 
and all, but the aer is getting 
worse as we're sitting here.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_554)Yeah.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_555)For now, we have to find whoever 
is making the Hermes blastia.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_556)Otherwise it'll be too late, 
just like Phaeroh said.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_557)But how are we supposed to find whoever that is?

## POINTER 32
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_558)If we follow whoever's looking for apatheia, 
they should lead us right to them.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_559)Cores are made from apatheia, after all.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_560)So <STR>(FRE) and Nan and their friends...

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_561)Yeah.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_562)I wonder if we'll 
have to...fight them...?

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_563)That's kind of up to them.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_564)What was that?
