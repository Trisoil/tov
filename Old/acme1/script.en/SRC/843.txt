Yo, <STR>(YUR)! Didn't expect 
to see you here!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Eh? Who're you again?

## POINTER 2

Ha ha ha. You 
haven't changed 
a bit, <STR>(YUR)!<PAGE>It's me, man! We were in the 
Imperial Knights together! 
I'm Agueron...remember?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Agueron? Ahh, yeah, I sort of
remember. You were the one
who always stole food, right?

## POINTER 4
Agueron
That was somebody else...
Well, not that it matters, really.<PAGE>It sounds like you've been doing 
pretty well since you got out.<PAGE>Me, I'm gonna keep working 
my butt off to help <STR>(FRE) 
build this new city!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, that's great! <STR>(FRE) could 
really use your help, I'm sure.

## POINTER 6
Agueron
People are expecting so much from <STR>(FRE) 
right now. I'm going to help him as 
much as I can from behind the scenes.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Thanks for that. Well, if there's
anything you need, just let me
know. I'll do what I can to help.

## POINTER 8
Agueron
Well, actually...<PAGE>The town's come a long way, and now 
it seems like people have stopped caring 
about its development so much...<PAGE>Up until now everyone was solid...we
were all working together. But the people
in town started to lose their enthusiasm.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Well, I'd say that's a pretty 
natural way for people to feel.

## POINTER 10
Agueron
Yeah... I mean, people want 
to relax, I'm sure.<PAGE>But some people have started throwing
all of their work onto <STR>(FRE)...even little
and manual labor around town.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
So what are you getting at?

## POINTER 12
Agueron
I want...to help the town remember the original 
spirit of industry that drove them to build 
their homes here in the first place.<PAGE>I was thinking that maybe...if they could 
feel some sense of accomplishment, maybe 
it could bring the town together again.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
......
So what are you saying 
should be done, exactly?

## POINTER 14
Agueron
Could you perhaps go and gather 
some building materials that 
we can't find near town?<PAGE>If we could get some more materials, 
I think we might be able to 
improve the town even more.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Well, we do 
have Ba'ul, 
after all...

## POINTER 16
Agueron
Please...help 
our town 
grow!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
I guess I've got no choice. 
I assume you don't want me 
to mention this to <STR>(FRE)?

## POINTER 18
Agueron
Yeah... He has far more 
important things to 
focus on right now.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Sounds good. That way 
he can keep his mind on 
what he needs to do.

## POINTER 20
Agueron
Thank you. There's nothing 
like a fellow knight to 
come through in a pinch!<PAGE>All right, then, could you bring me three
of each of the following? Desier Gold Dust,
Hypionia Tree Bark, and Yurzo Fruit.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Desier Gold Dust, Hypionia Tree
Bark, and Yurzo Fruit...three of 
each. Gotcha. I'll be back.
