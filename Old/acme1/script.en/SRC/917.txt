...I wanna see, I wanna see!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? What?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
They're doing synthesis! Don't 
you want to see, too?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
I, uh, not really... It doesn't 
really interest me.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Ugh, are you serious? Doesn't anyone care 
about learning new things anymore?!<PAGE>Just...please! Let me see where 
they do the synthesis!

## POINTER 5

Mmm... As much as I'd like to, that involves 
you seeing very sensitive trade secrets...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Come on, please! We're friends 
with your boss, you know!<PAGE>We won't spill the beans about 
your secrets! We promise!

## POINTER 7

Hmmm... Okay, hold on a minute, 
okay? I'm going to go and 
make sure it's okay.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Really?! 
Thanks!

## POINTER 9

...So it all boils down 
to a little quid-pro-quo.<PAGE>If you can bring us ○○○○, we'll show 
you where we do the synthesis.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Wow, ○○○○...<PAGE>I've heard of it, but I've never 
seen the real thing before...

## POINTER 11

If you find the ○○○○, 
go to Capua Torim.<PAGE>You can drop it off at to Fortune's 
Market's commercial office.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Got it.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
What's ○○○○, 
anyway?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
It raises the efficiency of the aer 
conversion process for blastia cores.<PAGE>It's like an adapter, 
of sorts...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Mmm, so it's a type 
of blastia part?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
Yes. Which means that they're definitely 
using blastia to do their work here!<PAGE>I wanna see! I want to see 
even more than before!<PAGE>All right! Let's 
go look for 
that ○○○○!
