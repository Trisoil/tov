<VOICE>(VS18_001)Continuing on, we will 
review the particulars 
of your 18th crime.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS18_002)Please do.

## POINTER 2
Leblanc
<VOICE>(VS18_003)Is it true that you threw a knight sent 
to collect the taxes into the river?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS18_004)Wow, I'd forgotten about that. 
Was that you, Tweedle A?

## POINTER 4
Adecor
<VOICE>(VS18_005)That's right! I was in bed 
with a cold for three whole 
days thanks to you.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS18_006)...How many more of these are there? 
This is getting pretty boring.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS18_007)...I wonder what'll 
happen to me.

## POINTER 7
Boccos
<VOICE>(VS18_008)So, I'll write you have "no signs 
of remorse" in the report then...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS18_009)Where's that do-nothing captain 
of yours, anyway? What was 
his name? Schwann?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS18_010)Playing hooky because he's the big shot.

## POINTER 10
Leblanc
<VOICE>(VS18_011)You dare mock our captain? Sir Schwann 
is a legendary hero and a veteran of the 
Great War ten years ago.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS18_012)So basically, his eminence would never stoop 
so low as to deal with nobodies like us.

## POINTER 12
Adecor
<VOICE>(VS18_013)Quiet, I say! Quiet! 
Getting on to your next offense...

## POINTER 13
Leblanc
<VOICE>(VS18_014)Y-your Excellency Commandant Alexei! 
To what do we owe this pleasure?!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS18_015)Alexei... What...?

## POINTER 15
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_016)All your crimes are hereby pardoned 
by the good graces of their 
Highnesses <STR>(EST) and Ioder.

## POINTER 16
Leblanc
<VOICE>(VS18_017)What?! But these foul criminals 
have disturbed the peace 
of the empire...!

## POINTER 17
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_018)The Imperial Knights thank you 
for rescuing Prince Ioder and 
protecting Princess <STR>(EST).

## POINTER 18

<VOICE>(VS18_019)Please take this.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS18_020)We've got no need for this. It's 
not like we did those things for 
the sake of the Knights.

## POINTER 20
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_021)I see.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS18_022)What about <STR>(EST_P)...?

## POINTER 22
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_023)She has just given her consent to be 
returned to the imperial capital.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS18_024)What? ...Well, I guess she 
is a princess, after all.

## POINTER 24
Alexei
<VOICE>(VS18_025)The Princess is waiting at 
the inn. We would be pleased 
if you made an appearance.
