I see that <STR>(FRE)'s a clean-freak 
as always.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Hold on. What's 
that book...?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? It says "Against a 
Backdrop of New Hope."

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Bingo! That's what 
I was looking for!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, good.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(FRE)
I come back to my room, and 
what do I see but a thief?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, hey, don't be so harsh! 
At least refer to me as 
an honorable outlaw!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(FRE)
Honorable outlaws are seldom so immodest 
as to refer to themselves as such.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Meh, details,
details.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(FRE)
So, what is such an honorable 
outlaw doing in my room?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Sorry, but could you 
give us this book?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(FRE)
<STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(FRE), my dear friend, 
could you somehow give 
us this book, please?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Somehow that doesn't sound 
entirely sincere...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(FRE)
<STR>(YUR), when will 
you ever learn...<PAGE>All right. 
You can have 
the book.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Thank you!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Thank you!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(FRE)
You fool, faking politeness is even 
harder than just asking direct...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
All right, so you've finally 
gotten all of them?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
Yep. I've collected 
all five.<PAGE>Now I can go and 
take that test.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
Going out to look for books all across 
the world...what a crazy test!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
Oh, the real test has yet to begin.<PAGE>There'll be a written test that requires 
using these books as reference material.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Agh, just thinking about taking 
tests makes my head hurt.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
Wouldn't you like to give it a 
try? Just to see how you do.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, I wouldn't have a chance. I don't care 
about that what's-his-face degree anyway.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah, giving something like that to you would 
be like casting pearls before swine.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, who're you calling swine?!
