<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_035)So much for keeping 
a low profile!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_036)<STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 2

<VOICE>(VS05_037)How can I ever thank you?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_038)Oh, it's nothing, really...

## POINTER 4

<VOICE>(VS05_039)I'm not sure what I would have done 
if you hadn't cured me. Thanks!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_040)...I'm just thankful that 
everyone's safe...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_041)Whoa...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_042)All worn out, huh?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_043)It really is dangerous beyond 
the barriers with so many 
ferocious monsters around.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_044)This place could definitely use a 
barrier against a pack that big.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_045)Couldn't they install a 
barrier blastia here?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_046)No. Barriers are a 
precious resource.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_047)You're right...and with 
the current technology, 
we can't make anymore.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS05_048)If only we could recover the secrets 
of the ancient Geraios civilization... 
They created the blastia.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_049)Even if that were to happen, I 
can't see the empire using the 
knowledge for the common good.

## POINTER 14

<VOICE>(VS05_050)You two there. I'd like 
to have a word with you.

## POINTER 15

<VOICE>(VS05_051)So why don't you let us through? 
I'll beat those monsters to a pulp 
with these fists of mine!

## POINTER 16

<VOICE>(VS05_052)How many times do I have to say it? These 
monsters are tougher than you think!

## POINTER 17

<VOICE>(VS05_053)You dare to doubt the power 
of the monster hunters?

## POINTER 18

<VOICE>(VS05_054)S-stop!

## POINTER 19

<VOICE>(VS05_055)Stay out of this! You Knights cheated 
us out of a job back there, and now 
we're gonna work off some steam!

## POINTER 20

<VOICE>(VS05_056)Hey, hold it!

## POINTER 21

<VOICE>(VS05_057)It's always the same with these guild idiots!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_058)Great, we'll never get through 
as long as this keeps up.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS05_059)But <STR>(FRE) is headed to Halure, 
and we're so close.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS05_060)Well, getting caught by the 
Knights wouldn't be too fun. Let's 
find another way through.
