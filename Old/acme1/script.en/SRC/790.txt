Come on, hurry up! 
Let's go inside!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
Patience is a virtue, young'un. Grown-ups 
move at a slower pace than you do.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
This resort seems to have 
a very peaceful feeling 
to it. Don't you think?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Ya, check out that bamboo 
fountain over there. This 
place is pretty zen.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Come on, we can talk about 
all of that once we get 
in the water! Let's go!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(KAR), you can go ahead 
if you want. We'll be in soon.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Okay, sure! See 
you outside!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Ah, youth. 
So pure, so 
innocent.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, that's what I like 
most about Captain <STR>(KAR).<PAGE>But is it really 
okay if your chest 
gets wet, old man?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Hmmm... I don't think there'll be 
any problem. 'Sides, a little 
electrocution is good fer ya! âˆ€

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
......
Stay out of the water 
when I'm in there.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Guys, guys! You're not 
gonna believe this!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
What's all the fuss, young'un? Yer not gonna 
tell me something fantastic like we can see
inta the women's baths, right?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
That's exactly what it is! There's 
a hole in the middle of the wall 
separating the two baths!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
Saints be praised...! Boy, why 
didn't ya say so sooner?!<PAGE>Hurry, hurry! The 
water's-a waitin'!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
......And I guess the best 
thing about the old man is 
his...perverted enthusiasm?
