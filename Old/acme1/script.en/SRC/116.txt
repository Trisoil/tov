<VOICE>(VS08_500)Hey, I've been wondering... How 
come you guys--and <STR>(RAP) 
too, I guess--all have blastia?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS08_501)Aren't bodhi blastia pretty rare? I 
didn't think many people had them.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS08_502)You have one too, though.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS08_503)I belong to a guild. Sometimes
we get a chance to get one. <PAGE><VOICE>(VS08_504)And Ruins' Gate keeps finding more. 
That's a guild that excavates blastia.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS08_505)Huh, there are even guilds that 
dig up blastia from ruins?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS08_506)If there weren't, then the empire 
would control all the blastia. 
Normal folks wouldn't get any.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS08_507)"The empire regulates the 
ancient blastia artifacts due 
to their potential danger"

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS08_508)I think that makes sense.
If blastia weren't regulated, 
anyone could use dangerous magic.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS08_509)But they've way overboard. 
They have a monopoly.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS08_510)Uh, I don't know about...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS08_511)So anyway, what's your story? 
How'd you get yours?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS08_512)I used to be in the Imperial Knights. 
This was a going-away present.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS08_513)<STR>(RAP) got his as a keepsake 
of his old owner.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS08_514)A going-away present? Sounds 
more like you stole it to me. 
...So, what about you, <STR>(EST_P)?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS08_515)Uh, I got mine from, uh...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS08_516)Look at her. She's a noble.
They all have these.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS08_517)I knew you were a noble!
Well, at least one of you 
has some class.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS08_518)Yeah, yeah. Let's go 
get that nia fruit.
