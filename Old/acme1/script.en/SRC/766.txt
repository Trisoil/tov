Crivvens, d'ye 
come ta eat 
batangi too?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Batangi? That's a type of fish, 
right? Is it any good...?

## POINTER 2

It useta be as bad as a brine-soaked 
boot! Ye couldna ate it if ye tried. 
But now, it's rather tasty!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
......

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
Ya say the fish useta taste 
bad, and now it's good?

## POINTER 5

Aye, it was a wee, gamey fishie, wit' nae meat oughtlins. But it got 
all nice an' fat all o' the sudden. It makes a right braw meal now!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
This could be caused by a local 
aer imbalance, as well.<PAGE>I wonder if there's an aer krene 
at the bottom of the ocean...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
...<STR>(JUD_P)...
Not 
again...

## POINTER 8

It's terrible! Hurry!

## POINTER 9

Eh? What's all this hubbub aboot?

## POINTER 10

I don't know any details... Simply 
that a blastia has been destroyed.

## POINTER 11

Who'd do a thing like that?

## POINTER 12

No one saw their face, but apparently 
it was someone wielding a spear.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
A spear...! It's that dragon freak!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, <STR>(RIT)...!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(RIT)'s always running off to one place or 
another! Isn't that right, <STR>(JUD_P)... <STR>(JUD_P)?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
I think <STR>(JUD_P)'s very much the 
same way, to be honest.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
Eh? I don't think 
that's true.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Where were you?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
A very nice gentleman 
invited me out to tea.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RAV)
What? Inconceivable!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
We don't need your commentary, old man.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
It seems like there's some 
commotion going on. 
Did something happen?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
A blastia was destroyed! By the same 
dragon rider as last time, too.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
Oh. How frightening!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah... I'll bet you're scared stiff...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
It was torn to pieces...<PAGE>Damn it! I swear, I'm going to make 
a permanent imprint of my fist into 
that dragon freak's face...!
