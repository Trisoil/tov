What's this...?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Oh, that's a camping set!<PAGE>With this, you can set up 
camp and sleep without 
having to go to an inn!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Oh, that's nice! Now you can go off and 
play nature boy whenever we sleep at 
an inn, and we'll save money, too!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Wh-what are you talking 
about? Camping sets 
are single-use only!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RIT), don't 
be so mean!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Hmph!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
That sounds really 
useful, <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, they're essential 
when you're on the road.<PAGE>In addition to camping sets, 
you could also sleep on mats.<PAGE>But camping sets are really the best 
thing to use. You can't get a better 
night's sleep with anything else!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
What wonderful timing! 
All of you look so exhausted 
from climbing...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
...You look pretty pooped, yourself.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, we've got a ways to go before 
we get to town, too. Maybe 
we should set up camp here?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Alright, I'll get everything set up!<PAGE>Oh, once you've camped somewhere, 
you won't be able to camp around 
there for a while afterwards.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Why's that?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
After camping at a certain site, the basic barrier that's 
included in the camping set will stop being effective 
for a while, so long as you're near that site.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Basic barrier? What's that? 
There's no blastia like that.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
It's not a blastia, actually.<PAGE>It's just something that gives off a 
smell that monsters find unpleasant. 
That's why they call it a "barrier."<PAGE>It can keep the monsters 
at bay for a night,<PAGE>but after enough time passes, the monsters get used 
to the smell, and it won't keep you safe anymore.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
Hmmm...
That makes 
sense...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Well then, we'll leave the 
setup to you, <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
All right. Let's set
up a camp a little
bit further.

## POINTER 19
Information
Set up a camp by using a Mat,
Simple Tent, Tent or Barrier
on the Field Map to recover
HP and TP. The amount of HP
or TP recovered depends on
the item. You will not be able to
use an item to set up camp
again until after the next battle.
