<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS59_068)Wow...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS59_069)So this is the oldest spring in the world...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS59_070)It's so quiet... The air is 
so clear... It feels holy.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS59_071)Never would have thought 
a place like this was at the 
bottom of the mountain.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS59_072)Watch it. That's aer, not 
water. It's really dense. 
You shouldn't go near it.

## POINTER 5

<VOICE>(VS59_073)You came.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS59_074)Hey, that's...?!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS59_075)You're Khroma, right?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS59_076)It doesn't look like you're 
trying to avenge Alexei.

## POINTER 8
Khroma
<VOICE>(VS59_077)...Duke didn't listen 
to you, did he?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS59_078)He is trying to protect 
the world in his own way.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS59_079)So what is Duke 
trying to do?!

## POINTER 10
Khroma
<VOICE>(VS59_080)He is trying to exchange 
the lives of humans 
to protect the world.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS59_081)What?!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS59_082)Why would Duke do something 
like that?!

## POINTER 13
Khroma
<VOICE>(VS59_083)He doesn't trust 
humans.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS59_084)But Duke helped 
us?!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS59_085)He even lent us his 
precious sword...

## POINTER 15
Khroma
<VOICE>(VS59_086)I assume he saw 
some of himself 
in you.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS59_087)Or perhaps he thought he wouldn't 
have to get his hands dirty 
as long as you were around.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS59_088)What do you...?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS59_089)Why are you telling 
us about Duke?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS59_090)I think it's time you showed who 
you really are, Entelexeia.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS59_091)Huh?!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS59_092)That form...!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS59_093)What do you want? Is this just 
a roundabout way of saying 
you're not going to help?

## POINTER 21
Khroma
<VOICE>(VS59_094)I, too, cannot trust humans. ...But 
neither do I want to see him 
take revenge on his own kind.

## POINTER 22
Khroma
<VOICE>(VS59_095)If you can truly save the world, 
then I will not refuse to help.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS59_096)However, you have chosen a 
different path. You will likely 
confront each other.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS59_097)Yeah...maybe.

## POINTER 24
Khroma
<VOICE>(VS59_098)If he is beyond your power, 
then nothing in this 
world can stop him.

## POINTER 25
Khroma
<VOICE>(VS59_099)I will test your 
strength!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS59_100)Here she comes!

## POINTER 27
Khroma
<VOICE>(VS59_101)...Marvelous. Perhaps 
you all...can indeed...save 
the world...

## POINTER 28
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS59_102)Khroma...

## POINTER 29
Khroma
<VOICE>(VS59_103)...Do as you wish.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS59_104)<STR>(EST_P)...come 
on. <STR>(JUD)...

## POINTER 31
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS59_105)...Right.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS59_106)Do it.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS59_107)It worked!

## POINTER 34
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS59_108)She's sleeping...

## POINTER 35
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS59_109)It's the same as with Gnome.

## POINTER 36
Undine
<VOICE>(VS59_110)A new comrade 
has been born.

## POINTER 37
Efreet
<VOICE>(VS59_111)...One who controls the winds. At 
times calm, at times violent.

## POINTER 38
Undine
<VOICE>(VS59_112)...One who controls the winds. At 
times calm, at times violent.

## POINTER 39
Undine
<VOICE>(VS59_113)She is not taken by 
aer as was Gnome.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS59_114)She should wake before long.

## POINTER 40
Undine
<VOICE>(VS59_115)There is nothing to fear. 
She will awaken shortly.

## POINTER 41
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS59_116)Thank you, 
Undine.

## POINTER 42
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS59_117)It seemed like Khroma 
knew a lot about Duke.

## POINTER 43
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS59_118)Indeed. Maybe we can ask her 
more when she's awake.

## POINTER 44
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS59_119)Let's head back for now.

## POINTER 45
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS59_120)Right. We don't have time 
to just hang around here.

## POINTER 46
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS59_121)Oh... Not that path again... These 
old bones of mine are tired...
