Oh, Miss! 
You came!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
How've you been doing?

## POINTER 2

Good! I've been watching all of the great things 
you've been doing from up here in the sky!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Can you really see all 
that from up here?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Krityans do have better 
sight than humans, but...<PAGE>I still think that'd 
be impossible.

## POINTER 5

Actually...I was using this.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Does that magnify the image of whatever it's pointed at?<PAGE>Blastia? No... I get the feeling 
it's somehow different.

## POINTER 7

They say that someone 
named Hermes made it, 
a long, long time ago.<PAGE>But I don't know how it works.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
That's pretty cool, 
bein' able ta see 
things so far away.

## POINTER 9

Yeah! I love watching 
Ball fly all over 
the world.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
It's Ba'ul.

## POINTER 11

Hey Miss, you were knocking 
a bunch of monsters into 
the sky, weren't you?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Wow, you could 
even see that?

## POINTER 13

Yeah! It was so cool! 
I even counted how 
many there were!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
You counted?

## POINTER 15

Yeah, you know... Those monsters 
that you hit up into the air and 
then they disappear! Poof!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
Sounds like he's talkin' 'bout fatal strikes.

## POINTER 17

I counted more than 
1000 of them! You 
guys are awesome!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
You're pretty awesome, yourself, 
for counting all of those.

## POINTER 19

It was so fun watching! I want 
to give you something to show 
you how much I liked it.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
That's very thoughtful of you.

## POINTER 21

I, I made this! 
It's for you!!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
Thank you.

## POINTER 23

C-can you try it on?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
All right. Just 
a minute.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(JUD)
What do you think?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
*Whistles*

## POINTER 27
<STR>(EST_P)
It looks great on you, <STR>(JUD)!

## POINTER 28
<STR>(KAR)
Wow. It doesn't 
look hand-made 
at all.

## POINTER 29

Heh, I thought you'd like it! I actually 
wanted to give it to you after I counted 
300 monsters, but it wasn't ready yet...

## POINTER 30
<STR>(JUD)
I'll take good care 
of it. Thank you.
