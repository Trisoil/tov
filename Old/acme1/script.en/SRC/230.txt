<STR>(RIT)
So you use a spear too...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
Oh, do you know
someone who 
also uses a spear?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Eh, well not quite.
It just reminds me 
of some jerk.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Are you talking about
that dragon rider?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah...<PAGE>Hey, don't you have something
you need to tell me.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
What? Me?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Yes.
So where is that 
dragon freak now.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
We got separated up on the roof. I'm pretty 
sure he wasn't too badly hurt...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Good, because I can't very well beat 
him up if he's already injured!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Whoa whoa, that's the whole 
reason you came here?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
No! I also can't forgive this 
Barbos guy for what he did!<PAGE>Abusing blastia like that! 
Has he no shame?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
That's no reason to bring the 
Princess along with you to a 
dangerous place like this.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
It's not <STR>(RIT)'s fault. 
I decided to come 
here, myself.<PAGE>I can't see bad people doing harm to 
others and simply let it happen.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
I agree. Very 
well said.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Captain <STR>(KAR), don't let me down! 
I'm counting on your skills!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
Yes, of course! Come on, let's 
go take that jerk to school!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
I'm sorry, but would you mind keeping your 
background to yourself? We've got someone 
who might kind of explode if she knew.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
Sure, I understand. That'll 
be best for both of our 
interests.
