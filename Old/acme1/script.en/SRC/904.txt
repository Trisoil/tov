Oh! Excuse me, young lady! Can 
you spare a minute or two?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Huh? You mean me?

## POINTER 2

Yes, yes indeed! You think 
you might want to play a little 
stone-taking game with me?<PAGE>To make it interesting, I'll give 
you a nice present if you can 
beat me! What do you say?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Hmmm... Well, 
why not?<PAGE>But...are you sure? I'm pretty 
good at that kind of game!

## POINTER 4

Ho ho! Excellent! I've been 
looking for an opponent 
to give me a challenge.<PAGE>They call me the Master! I won't 
go down without a fight.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
*Sigh*
Do we really have 
time to be sitting 
and playing games?

## POINTER 6
Challenge the Dice Master?
Play a game!
Maybe not.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Don't worry. I'll make 
short work of this geezer. 
Just wait and see.

## POINTER 8

Ho ho! Well then, 
shall we begin?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
Umm, I'm sorry, sir! He's right... 
We really don't have time to 
be playing games right now.

## POINTER 10

Ah, that's a shame... Well, 
if you change your mind, 
come back anytime.

## POINTER 11

Oh, back so soon? 
Ready for a game?

## POINTER 12

Ho ho! Well then, 
shall we begin?

## POINTER 13

Ah, that's a shame... Well, 
if you change your mind, 
come back anytime.
