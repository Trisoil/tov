Ah, so nice to see you 
again! And wearing your 
uniforms, I see!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
We're all so fond 
of them! âˆ€

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
All I've got is this 
stupid towel...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
I wasn't too crazy about the loincloth I've 
got on, but I'm startin' ta get used ta it.<PAGE>Besides, boy, the fewer clothes on yer 
back, the faster ya can jump inta the 
bath! That's a pretty nice perk.

## POINTER 4

So, will you be visiting 
our hot springs today?<PAGE>Your free pass entitles you to any 
of our services...even your own 
reserved bath, if you'd like.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
We've come all the way 
out here... Why not?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
All right, then us 
girls will go in first 
again, okay?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
How about we all just 
go in together? I mean, 
what's the big deal?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
B-b-but that 
means...!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
The baths are pretty big. We could 
go to separate ends of the area, and 
it'd be like we had our own baths.<PAGE>It'd be no big deal. Isn't 
that right, <STR>(RAV)?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
R-right, <STR>(YUR)... I mean, 
I don't really mind either 
way, of course...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
Something's fishy 
about this...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
No, I trust <STR>(YUR). 
I don't think we 
need to worry.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. Let's just stop 
fretting about it and 
all go in together!

## POINTER 14

Go right on in! 
Enjoy your visit!<PAGE>But might I recommend waiting until after 
sunset and going in then? I assure you, the 
nighttime atmosphere is not to be missed!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Ah, good idea. 
Let's do that.
