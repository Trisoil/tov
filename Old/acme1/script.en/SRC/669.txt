...Why won't my brother come 
back... No one's left to 
oppose the marriage...<PAGE>Lune's been waiting for him this entire 
time! I have to do something, so that 
the three of us can be happy again...<PAGE>I can't rely on anyone else anymore. 
I have to help him...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Does something seem odd 
about Shel to you?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, Shel.

## POINTER 3
Shel
Oh, hello. Do you 
need something?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Well, it's about 
your brother.

## POINTER 5
Shel
Oh, don't worry about that anymore.<PAGE>I'm sorry I asked such an odd 
favor of you. Please, forget I 
ever said anything about it.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
But what about Clay...?

## POINTER 7
Shel
I've been thinking about it, and I've 
decided that I can't entrust this 
sort of thing to anyone else.<PAGE>This is something that I have to do 
myself, so please, don't let it trouble 
you. Now, if you'll excuse me...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
What was that all about?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
He said he'd handle it himself...ya think he's 
got some idea where his brother might be?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Hard to say. It still bothers me a bit, 
but if he says he doesn't want our 
help, I guess that's the end of it.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
This leaves a bad taste in my mouth...
