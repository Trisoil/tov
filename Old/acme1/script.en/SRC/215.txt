Anomalous aer conditions result in 
blastia going out of control, which in 
turn leads to monsters turning vicious...<PAGE>If this is related to the "distortion" 
he was talking about, then it might not 
be only this forest that's affected.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
You sure mumble to yourself a lot, don't you?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Ack, what?! Another 
monster attack?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(KAR), keep your head down!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
It's...it's them...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Don...!

## POINTER 6
Don Whitehorse
...You all do something?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Do something? What do you mean?

## POINTER 8
Don Whitehorse
Those savage monsters turned 
docile as pups and ran off! 
What did you do?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
...<STR>(YUR), it must be because 
we stopped the flow of 
the aer...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
The monsters turned 
tame because we stopped 
the runaway aer!

## POINTER 11
Don Whitehorse
Runaway aer?
Hmmm...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, old man. Do you 
know something!?

## POINTER 13
Don Whitehorse
Well my old friend, Belius,
used to say something 
about it.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
...So it's true that Don and 
Belius are friends...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Who is Belius?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
The Duce who rules the 
coliseum of Nordopolica.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
Nordopolica...

## POINTER 18
Don Whitehorse
And what's with 
that runaway aer?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
It was really amazing! More 
and more really strong monsters 
kept on coming, but we--

## POINTER 20
Don Whitehorse
Boy, those are the sort of 
things you keep to yourself.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
What...?

## POINTER 22
Don Whitehorse
You don't do deeds like that so other people 
will notice. You do them so that you can 
protect your town and your friends.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
I-I'm sorry...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
Excuse me, could I see 
him for a moment?

## POINTER 25
Don Whitehorse
What?

## POINTER 26

Ohh...you can use healing 
artes... Thank you...

## POINTER 27
Don Whitehorse
...Hmm? Ain't that 
<STR>(RAV) over there?

## POINTER 28
Don Whitehorse
Quit hidin', you!

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RAV)
Humph.

## POINTER 30
Don Whitehorse
Our man ain't givin' 
you trouble, is he?

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RAV)
Whaddaya mean, "trouble?" The 
reason the monsters got tame was 
our doing, mine especially!

## POINTER 32
<STR>(KAR)
Huh?! <STR>(RAV)'s a member 
of Altosk?!

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
Somehow that seems to be the case.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(RAV)
Ouch, gramps, 
cut that 
out!

## POINTER 35
Don Whitehorse
Shut up, you!

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
Don Whitehorse.

## POINTER 37
Don Whitehorse
What is it?

## POINTER 38
<STR>(YUR)
I know we've only just met, but I have 
something I need to talk to you about.

## POINTER 39

Don, sorry to interrupt.

## POINTER 40
Don Whitehorse
Ah, I see. All right you 
dogs! Time to head out!

## POINTER 41
Don Whitehorse
Sorry 'bout this, but something's 
come up. We've gotta return 
to Dahngrest.<PAGE>If ya come by the Union you'll 
have my ear first chance I 
get. Hope that's okay.

## POINTER 42
<STR>(YUR)
If I have your word, 
that's fine by me.

## POINTER 43
Don Whitehorse
Hmph, you're not nervous at all to talk to me. You 
all would make a good addition to our guild.

## POINTER 44
<STR>(YUR)
Guild, huh.

## POINTER 45
<STR>(KAR)
We're going to make one, right?

## POINTER 46
<STR>(YUR)
We'll see.

## POINTER 47
<STR>(RAV)
So, what do you think? Y'all finally 
get a taste of how awesome I am?

## POINTER 48
<STR>(KAR)
I sure didn't notice you being 
too awesome out there!

## POINTER 49
<STR>(RAV)
Always so quick 
to criticize!

## POINTER 50
<STR>(YUR)
All right, I'd like to go back 
to Dahngrest to meet with the Don 
and keep looking for Barbos.

## POINTER 51
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RIT), once <STR>(YUR)'s done with 
his business, we should 
go back to report...

## POINTER 52
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RIT)?

## POINTER 53
<STR>(RIT)
...Oh, what was that?

## POINTER 54
<STR>(EST_P)
Once <STR>(YUR)'s done, we should go 
back to report to Alexei...

## POINTER 55
<STR>(EST_P)
Is something the matter?

## POINTER 56
<STR>(RIT)
N-no, it's nothing. Come 
on, let's go back.
