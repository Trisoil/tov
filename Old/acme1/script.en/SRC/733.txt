Is this a barrier blastia, too? 
It's not activated, but...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
Even if it's not working, maybe they 
want to leave it here as a symbol 
of protection for the city?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
...I think I figured 
it out.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh? What did you figure out?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Why I like blastia, 
that is...<PAGE>For me, blastia are like 
my brothers and sisters.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Your brothers and sisters...?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
I didn't have a father while I was growing up, 
and my mother died when I was young, too.<PAGE>But blastia were always with me, 
even when no one else was.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
So that's what you mean by brothers 
and sisters...that makes sense.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
And my knowledge of 
blastia developed 
and grew as I did.<PAGE>Maybe that's why I always felt 
so close to them, and why I got 
so mad when they were broken.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
......

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
...But I'll have to be saying goodbye 
to all of those blastia soon...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
Brothers and sisters...can't be together 
with you forever. Someday, you have 
to leave them behind and move on.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Someday, you say...?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
When you find someone who's even more important to you.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
But just because you're separated from 
them, that doesn't mean that the important 
link you had with them is broken.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
...Maybe you're right...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
And just because 
you're apart...<PAGE>That doesn't mean that you have to forget how 
important they are, or how much you love them.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(EST_P)... <STR>(JUD)...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
And <STR>(RIT), you've found a lot 
of people who care about you 
very much. Isn't that right?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
...Hmm...
You've still got 
a long way to go before you're 
as good as the blastia.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(JUD)
A long way to go?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Apparently so.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
You're terrible, <STR>(RIT)!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RAV)
This is how ya repay my love? You shrew!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
You're so annoying! And you're 
the worst of all, old man!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
...Maybe someday <STR>(RIT) will 
learn how to take affection 
gracefully...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(JUD)
I don't think it's so bad. I mean, I think 
that's one of her cutest traits!
