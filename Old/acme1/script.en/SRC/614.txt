It's good to see you, <STR>(YUR). 
You must be tired. Feel 
free to rest up here.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
I'd like to take you up 
on that, but we're actually 
in a bit of a hurry.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
We must be moving on once we've 
asked what we came to ask.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(FRE)
Ask who? Me?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Did you ever see a secret manual 
for refining metal ore among the 
items confiscated by the Knights?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(FRE)
A secret...manual...?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(FRE)
No. Confiscated items were 
always under the jurisdiction 
of the Schwann brigade...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
What? Starin' at me isn't 
gonna help. I'm not that 
Schwann guy, ya know...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Oh yeah...?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Sounds like Schwann was even more 
clueless than I'd thought.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(FRE)
Keeping track of all these items is 
basically paperwork. It's not something 
a captain usually deals with.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
Ya know, this one's not 
so bad after all...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(FRE)
...Thank you. Unless it's 
a recent acquisition we should 
have a copy here...<PAGE>But I'm not seeing anything that 
looks like a manual here...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Oh well... We had to check. Thanks, 
man. We're gonna get going.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(FRE)
Yo... <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Huh?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(FRE)
Give 'em hell out there.
