Hey there, welcome, welcome! 
How's it hangin'?<PAGE>I'll show you something 
you don't see everyday!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
Hmm, just looks 
like a regular ol' 
model to me.

## POINTER 2

This is why I don't like giving 
the presentation to amateurs! Meh! 
Anyway, have a look, will ya?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
He's just talking to us like 
he knows us...and yet, it's really 
getting on my nerves...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Try not to let it rile 
you up so much, <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 5

Come on now, enough 
mumbling to yourselves! 
Look! Look!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Huh?
Huuh? 
Me?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Who better than the 
ever-curious Captain <STR>(KAR)? 
It's right there...just do it.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Why do I always have 
to be the guinea pig...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
You're getting to be pioneer 
of the group, twice in a row! 
I think you should be proud!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
You're just trying to make 
me feel better about it...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Ugh... Okay, I'm 
going to look... 
I'm gonna do it!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Awesome! I remember when 
that happened, and now I 
got to see it happen again!

## POINTER 13

See, I told ya! This isn't something 
you see everyday, now is it?<PAGE>This wonderful device has 
the all-too-appropriate name 
of the "Movie Player V"!<PAGE>Its only function is to let 
you watch events that've already 
happened. Easy as pie!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
This is some truly 
remarkable blastia.

## POINTER 15

Blastia? That shabby excuse 
for a technology? You 
underestimate us!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
Shabby? Whaddya mean shabby?!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(RIT), chill. So, we 
can look at this whenever 
we want, then?

## POINTER 18

So long as you wash your hands 
before using it, yep! Oh, and try 
not to hit or kick it, either!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
You don't need to worry. We're 
all mature individuals here. 
We'll come and see it again!
