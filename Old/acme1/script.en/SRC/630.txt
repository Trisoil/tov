<VOICE>(VA022_031)What brings 
you here?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA022_032)We're just travelers passing through.

## POINTER 2

<VOICE>(VA022_033)I'm sorry, but there is 
no longer an inn or any 
shops in this town.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA022_034)Are you here alone?

## POINTER 4

<VOICE>(VA022_035)Yes. It's 
just me.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA022_036)...You wouldn't 
happen to be the 
sage, would you?

## POINTER 6

<VOICE>(VA022_037)The humans of this town 
once called me that.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA022_038)Huh...?
But didn't the sage die...?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA022_039)Shh...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA022_040)This is an illusion Phaeroh 
made, right...?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA022_041)So that would mean this is actually the 
Yormgen of a thousand years ago...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA022_042)Yeah. I wonder if the lack of a barrier blastia 
is the reason everyone else took off.

## POINTER 12

<VOICE>(VA022_043)How perceptive. Blastia cannot 
easily be acquired, nor do we 
have the clear ciel crystal...<PAGE><VOICE>(VA022_044)The Children of the Full Moon 
should never have signed the 
pact with the Entelexeia.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA022_045)Pact?

## POINTER 14

<VOICE>(VA022_046)They agreed to bury most of the 
blastia, with the Children standing 
watch over the rest.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA022_047)In order to protect against the Adephagos.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA022_048)So then... The ancient civilization 
didn't collapse... 
It was sealed up...

## POINTER 17

<VOICE>(VA022_049)Well, I thought you were perceptive, but 
now I see you actually know nothing.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA022_050)Wh-what...?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA022_051)Supervising the use of blastia... Doesn't 
that remind you of the empire today?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VA022_052)Well, <STR>(EST_P) is a Child of the Full Moon, not 
to mention one of the heirs to the throne.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA022_053)Wait...! So then, the Children 
of the Full Moon must have 
founded the empire...

## POINTER 22

<VOICE>(VA022_054)Please, there's no need 
to speak in hushed tones.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA022_055)The pact will surely be forsaken. 
Unless, that is, all blastia can 
be done away with for good.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA022_056)But people couldn't live like 
they do now without blastia.

## POINTER 24

<VOICE>(VA022_057)A certain type of life can be 
led, even without blastia.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA022_058)Yeah, the inconvenient type.

## POINTER 26

<VOICE>(VA022_059)So it has always been. They come 
to depend on anything that 
eases the burdens of life.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA022_060)Yet even knowing that, you helped 
the people of this town to 
build a barrier blastia?

## POINTER 28

<VOICE>(VA022_061)I, too, was poisoned by the desire 
for greater things. I couldn't 
ignore the convenience.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA022_062)Now what kind of a sage does that?

## POINTER 30

<VOICE>(VA022_063)To be a sage means only to be 
rich in knowledge. I too belong 
to the society of people.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA022_064)Being a saint isn't a 
prerequisite for leadership, 
then, huh...?

## POINTER 32

<VOICE>(VA022_065)Well put. And the Children of 
the Full Moon are no different.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA022_066)The role of supervisor will 
turn into one of absolute 
authority before long.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA022_067)Wh-what does that mean?

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA022_068)It's pretty clear if you look 
at what the Empire's become.

## POINTER 35

<VOICE>(VA022_069)Anyway, nothing remains 
in this village. 
Not even blastia.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA022_070)You are welcome to stay the 
night, if you don't mind the 
ramblings of an old man.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA022_071)Thanks.
