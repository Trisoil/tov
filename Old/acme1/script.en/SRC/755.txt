Ah! It's been a while since 
we've seen you in here, baby. 
What happened to you?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
Oho, what a nice surprise. I've 
been out runnin' all over the 
place on the Don's orders.

## POINTER 2

No way, baby! Are you 
kidding? You and hard 
work don't mix!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Goin' on a world tour is pretty nice. You should try it sometime.

## POINTER 4

Tee hee hee! I'll bet you've 
been partying it up everywhere 
you've gone. You rascal!<PAGE>By the way...

## POINTER 5

Your friends don't seem like your usual crowd. You haven't been 
trolling the local high schools for jailbait, have you?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
Nah, not at all.

## POINTER 7

Ah. Good. Well, let's 
have a drink next time 
you're free. See ya.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
A friend of yours?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Just someone I know.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
I dunno, you two seemed pretty buddy-buddy, Old Man...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(KAR), let's keep our nosy little 
questions to ourselves, eh?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
What the hell's her problem?
