All right, on to the next step.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Huh...what?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
It should be easier to go in 
if you dress like a knight.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Who, me?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
<STR>(KAR) would work just as well.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Wah, again?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Wah, m-me?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, maybe you're right...

## POINTER 8
Who will disguise as a knight?
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(KAR)

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
I guess I'll have 
to do it.<PAGE>But really, a knight, 
of all things...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Oh well, if this helps us 
fool them, all the better.

## POINTER 11

Hey! Quit goofing 
off over there!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? What's the matter?

## POINTER 13

You should get back to your post before 
things get even more out of hand!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
What do you mean, "out of hand?"

## POINTER 15

The mage we captured 
is running wild! 
Hurry up!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Roger! Okay, be 
right back.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(KAR), you do it.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
Y-you want me to dress up as a knight? 
But...will the suit fit me?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
Urgh, it's hard to move around.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Don't worry, you'll get 
used to it quickly.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
I wonder...

## POINTER 23

Hey! Quit goofing 
off over there!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
Uh, uhh...?

## POINTER 25

You should get back to your post before 
things get even more out of hand!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(KAR)
No, you've got it all wrong! 
Wait, let go, heeeelp!

## POINTER 27
<STR>(EST_P)
...<STR>(YUR), why didn't 
you help him out?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
I, uhh...I was taken by surprise, 
it all happened so fast...<PAGE>We should go and see what's happened...
