Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_001)So you've come 
back, have ya?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_002)...<STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 2
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_003)What, you two
know each other?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_004)Yes, we're old friends...

## POINTER 4
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_005)Ya don't say.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_006)I see you know 
<STR>(YUR) as well.

## POINTER 6
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_007)We crossed paths during the 
assault on the city. Now then, 
what business did ya have?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_008)Uh...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_009)We came to ask you about 
a man named Barbos of 
the Blood Alliance.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_010)It looks like he's the one behind the 
recent string of stolen blastia cores.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_011)I see, so Barbos is tied up 
in your problem as well.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_012)...You have a problem with him, too?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_013)We have come to ask that the Union relinquish 
all ties with the Blood Alliance.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_014)Other guilds have begun to follow Barbos' 
example, abusing blastia in other areas 
and disrupting the order of society.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_015)If we can count on your assistance, 
I feel that together we should move 
to put an end to the Blood Alliance.

## POINTER 12
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_016)...Barbos. He's been testing the 
limits of my patience lately.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_017)Looks like it's time to remind that 
brute how a proper guild behaves.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_018)A clash between the guilds and the 
empire was avoided the other day, 
largely due to your intervention.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_019)However, if Barbos is left unattended, 
the relations between our two states 
may yet again be torn apart.

## POINTER 14
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_020)That's not gonna 
be fun for anybody.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_021)The time for stopping 
Barbos is now.

## POINTER 16
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_022)Since we'd be cooperatin' with ya, 
I assume we'd be on equal standing 
with the empire in this.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_023)Yes, sir.

## POINTER 18
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_024)Humph. If that's the case, a 
united front with the empire 
might not be such a bad idea.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_025)Then...

## POINTER 20
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_026)Yeah, we'll deal 
with this together.

## POINTER 21
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_027)Hey. Send a message 
to Belius.

## POINTER 22
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_028)Tell Belius that 
Nordopolica's gonna help us.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS20_029)Man, this is serious...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_030)I've brought a letter from
his Highness Ioder.

## POINTER 25
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_031)A secret note from the 
imperial candidate, huh?

## POINTER 26
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_032)Read it aloud.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS20_033)"If Don Whitehorse is taken out of the 
picture, we are willing to overlook the 
Union's responsibility in the Barbos affair."

## POINTER 28
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_034)What...?!

## POINTER 29
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_035)Hah hah hah! 
Don't make me laugh!

## POINTER 30
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_036)...What...what is this?

## POINTER 31
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_037)Looks like you and the 
young master see things 
a bit differently.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_038)There must be some mistake! Master 
Ioder would never say such a thing.

## POINTER 33
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_039)Show our guest here to 
his own private suite!

## POINTER 34
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_040)Don Whitehorse, please 
listen to me! This is 
some sort of trap!

## POINTER 35
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS20_041)<STR>(FRE)...!

## POINTER 36
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS20_042)Why would you...?

## POINTER 37
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_043)Hang on.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_044)If we screw up, it'll 
only make things worse 
for <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 38
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS20_045)...

## POINTER 39
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_046)All-out war with the empire! 
We'll take everything we've got 
and march on the imperial capital!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_047)Try and make a fool out of 
me?! I'll tear these little 
messengers limb from limb!

## POINTER 40
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS20_048)Th-this is bad!

## POINTER 41
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS20_049)And it looks like he's forgotten 
all about talking with us.

## POINTER 42
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_050)I don't think the Don's 
in much of a talking 
mood right now.

## POINTER 43
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS20_051)I have to return to the empire and 
find out what's really going on!

## POINTER 44
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_052)I said hang on. We should sit still 
for now and see what happens.

## POINTER 45
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS20_053)I...I suppose you're right.
