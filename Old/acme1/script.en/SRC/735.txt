...You know, I think it'd be 
better if we turned back.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
How come?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
This is where that 
broken blastia is.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
I know that.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Come on, let's go back. 
If the knights find us 
we'll get in trouble.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
I just want to have a 
look at that blastia!<PAGE>...I'm just going to look.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
You might get caught!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
I'm not that much of a klutz!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RIT)...!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Hey now...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Ekaterine...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Ekaterine...
...She 
named that blastia, 
didn't she?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
......

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
All set?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Yes.<PAGE>There's...nothing that 
I can do for her...
It's just too cruel...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
I mean, I understand that blastia 
are very valuable items, but...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
It's not about how valuable they are. Countless people have 
given their lives to make human civilization what it is.<PAGE>And blastia have been living together with 
mankind all of that time. They're more 
than just a simple tool that we use.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
...Well, it's certainly 
clear that blastia are 
very important to <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
If you're all finished here, we should be on our way.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Okay.
