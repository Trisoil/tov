They say two more people 
went missing last night.

You'd think people would know better, with that guild's 
reputation for loan-sharking. But I guess the tourists 
don't have any idea what they're getting into.

## POINTER 2

Isn't the guild in cahoots with the 
tipsters? Nordopolica regulars wouldn't 
fall for a scam like that...

## POINTER 3

Where do they take the 
people who go missing?

## POINTER 4

Who can say? But no one ever 
comes back, that's for sure.

## POINTER 5

I hope no one disappears 
tonight...
