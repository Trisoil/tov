<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS12_034)If you're seeing us off, we'll say goodbye here.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS12_035)I'm going with you.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS12_036)Y-you're doing what?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS12_037)Oh, so this is why you told us not to 
leave without saying goodbye, huh?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS12_038)Yeah.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS12_039)Is that it? Just "yeah?"

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS12_040)Can you just leave like that? You're 
an important mage here right?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS12_041)...Hmm...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS12_042)I want to see Halure's barrier blastia 
for myself. It's no good to the people 
there if it's broken, right?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS12_043)Actually, the three of us fixed it together.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS12_044)Huh? What do you mean 
you "fixed" it? You're 
just amateurs.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS12_045)You know, we revived it. 
It was great! Estel--

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS12_046)Let's just say it was beginner's luck.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS12_047)Now I'm really worried. I'll 
have to go see if it's been 
done properly or not.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS12_048)Suit yourself.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS12_049)W-what?!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS12_050)I've never had a real friend 
my own age before!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS12_051)I-I'm not so sure we're--

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS12_052)This is going to be so much fun!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS12_053)Y-yeah...
