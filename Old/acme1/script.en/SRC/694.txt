<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(EST_P)'s master...

## POINTER 1
Drake
...Oh, it's you...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Did you have a part 
in that twisted Commandant's 
plan, too?

## POINTER 3
Drake
...I knew exactly what the 
Commandant was up to.<PAGE>That's why I was working so close to 
him, trying to keep an eye on him... 
But he got the better of me...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
A little too slow in 
your old age, huh?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(YUR), watch what 
you're saying...!

## POINTER 6
Drake
No...I shall take the blame for what happened.<PAGE>Had I managed to stop the Commandant, 
the Princess would not 
have been abducted.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
No... I'm done yelling at 
you. It's not getting <STR>(EST_P) 
back any faster.

## POINTER 8
Drake
......

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
It's not like blaming you will make 
me feel any better, anyway.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Right. That's why we 
have to save <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 11
Drake
Maybe it's time this old soldier 
just faded away...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Not yet, you don't.

## POINTER 13
Drake
...?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
There's something <STR>(EST_P)'s 
still waiting for you to say.<PAGE>She wants to know that she's 
proven herself to you.

## POINTER 15
Drake
...After everything that's happened, 
I don't feel worthy to say something 
like that to the Princess.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
Hey, I'm sure you'll manage, Drake. 
Keep your chin up, hey?

## POINTER 17
Drake
Captain Schwann...
