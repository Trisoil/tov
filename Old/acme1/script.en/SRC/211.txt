Hmm? Who are you all?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
We need to talk to the Don about something. 
Help us out, could you?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
It's a matter that concerns 
the five master guilds.

## POINTER 3

I haven't seen you around here recently. 
What guild do you belong to?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Er, we don't belong to a guild, exactly.

## POINTER 5

...Unfortunately, the Don has left 
town in pursuit of the monsters.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
He went after the monsters?

## POINTER 7

Yes, he plans on taking out the 
monster nests in one fell swoop.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
I see...
Thanks for the information.

## POINTER 9

No worries.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
...If I went and helped them, I 
could prove myself to the Don...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, well. Shall we go look 
for information in town?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
...What? We're not going 
to help the Don?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
So you know where the monster 
nests are, then?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
Oh, good point...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Since it seems like you won't be 
making progress anytime soon, I'm 
going to go check out Keiv Moc.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
How selfish!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
I just want to get it out of 
the way as soon as possible.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Then does that mean <STR>(EST_P)'s 
going along with you?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. I told Alexei 
I was going to go, 
after all...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
Don't worry. We'll be fine 
between the two of us.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Sorry, 'fraid not. If you got 
hurt or anything, <STR>(FRE) would 
hunt me down and kill me.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
You're going to go, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Well, we don't really have any 
good leads around town 
that we're following, anyway.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
Then it's decided! 
Let's go to the forest 
of Keiv Moc.

## POINTER 25

Going to Keiv Moc, are they? 
What a coincidence...
