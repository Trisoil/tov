It feels like 
it was ages ago 
that I left.<PAGE>Heh heh. You feel the 
same way, Ba'ul?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
You're talking with Ba'ul?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Yeah. We were just 
remembering the time 
that we first met.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Would you mind telling 
me about it?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
A long time ago, Ba'ul 
used to live on the 
summit of Mt. Temza.<PAGE>The townspeople all feared him... They thought 
of him as a giant, ferocious monster.<PAGE>But I talked to Ba'ul, 
and eventually, we 
became friends.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
About how old 
were you then?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
I don't remember exactly, but 
I think I was pretty young.<PAGE>From that point on, we 
started traveling together. 
My dad came, too.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Your father did?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
My dad had a fierce passion for 
blastia. I feel like I was influenced 
a lot by him as I grew up.<PAGE>Soon after that, the Great War happened. 
I was about to become a statistic, 
and then Ba'ul saved me.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
You were right in the middle 
of the battle, weren't you?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
Yes... My fellow Krityans took me 
up into Myorzo for a while, but 
I went back down to the surface.<PAGE>And then, I decided 
to travel around the 
planet with Ba'ul.<PAGE>To destroy all of the Hermes blastia, and 
rid the world of its negative effects.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
I see. So Ba'ul 
saved your life.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
Yes.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
I feel like I understand the connection 
between you two a lot better now. 
Thanks for sharing that with me.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
Dad...
