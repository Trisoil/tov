Doesn't look like Dyne's here... I wonder 
if he's at the inn taking a rest.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Maybe we just got 
here ahead of him.

## POINTER 2
Dyne
<STR>(KAR)...!<PAGE>F-forgive me. Me and my guys 
are pretty much done for...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
What happened?! Did you already 
go up against the monster...?!

## POINTER 4
Dyne
N-no... We all ate some food 
that was a little past its 
prime, so to speak...<PAGE>I'm not too much the worse for wear, 
but the others are lucky if they 
can manage to stand up...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Sucks to be you guys.

## POINTER 6
Dyne
You're telling me...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
We'll just have to cool 
our heels here until you 
guys are feeling better.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
Fortunately, there doesn't seem 
to be any sign of the monster.

## POINTER 9
Dyne
That's actually a 
bit of a problem.<PAGE>You see, the monster went and abducted 
the man who hired us to defeat it.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
Okay, now this 
is officially 
a mess.

## POINTER 11
Dyne
And I have a suspicion our client is the 
type who's never really held a sword.<PAGE>I can only hope he's still all right... 
I'd like to go to his rescue right 
now, but in this condition...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Which way did 
the monster go?

## POINTER 13
Dyne
He flew off 
straight north 
from here.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Flew...?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
Going north from here would 
take us right to Mt. Temza.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Could it be that huge 
monster the last time 
we were there?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
...Just might be.

## POINTER 18
Dyne
...Oh no, my stomach...! 
I've gotta run... 
Good luck...!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Guess it's on us...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
So, Mt. Temza. Let's go 
see what we can find out.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
Right.
