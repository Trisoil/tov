Wh-what was that all about?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
It looks like somebody snitched on us.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Snitched?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
You're too well-known for
your own good, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Isn't guild influence really strong in Torim?
Maybe that knight was overcompensating 
for how impotent he must feel.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR), that knight was just trying to do his job! I'd 
appreciate it if you kept your insults to yourself.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Ugh... I'm never gonna be 
able to get a good night's 
sleep at this rate...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Well, at least we got away without getting 
caught, right? We can be happy about that.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Happy? This is annoying as all hell!<PAGE>The next time we stay at 
an inn, you can sleep 
outside with the dog!
