## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS31_157)Sorry to keep you waiting.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS31_158)...You'll be heading 
back too, right?

## POINTER 2

<VOICE>(VS31_159)Yes. Thanks to your help, we've 
recovered our strength.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS31_160)We were thinking we'd cross the desert with 
you all... That is, if you don't mind.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS31_161)Just make sure ya don't go wanderin' off.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS31_162)How about us? What's 
our plan after this?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS31_163)I'm headed for the aer krene 
in the Weasand of Cados.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS31_164)But I am curious about 
the Entelexeia, too.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS31_165)I have the honored 
task of delivering this 
letter here ta Belius.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS31_166)I'd like to meet Belius once myself.
I mean, seriously! The Duce!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS31_167)I want to see just what kind of 
person the leader of the only 
guild to rival Altosk really is.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS31_168)It's Nordopolica for me too. I'm 
gonna see what <STR>(FRE) has to say 
about those knights in Mantaic.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS31_169)That's assuming he's still 
in Nordopolica, of course.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS31_170)I...I want to know why 
the Entelexeia hate the 
Child of the Full Moon.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS31_171)Which means I have 
to meet Phaeroh...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS31_172)But there's got to be 
another way that 
doesn't involve Phaeroh.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS31_173)Right... Besides, walking around 
in the desert just looking for 
him wouldn't be easy.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS31_174)Why don't we all head 
for Nordopolica, then?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS31_175)You're only looking to find out 
the reason you were...attacked 
by the Entelexeia, correct?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS31_176)Y-yes...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS31_177)I imagine Belius could tell 
you if you met with her.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS31_178)Why, because of the 
connection between the 
Entelexeia and the coliseum?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS31_179)I do remember Yeager 
mumblin' somethin' about 
the Entelexeia of Nordopolica.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS31_180)If we can believe 
anything he told us.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS31_181)Well, we'll pass through the 
Weasand of Cados on the way 
to see Belius. Good enough?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS31_182)True enough. All right, 
then, Nordopolica it is.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS31_183)Right. First let's get 
back to Mantaic.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS31_184)Didn't Belius only meet with people 
on the night of the new moon?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS31_185)Yeah. We'll have to get a move 
on if we're going to see her.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS31_186)I'll kick myself if we miss 
the new moon and have 
to wait another month.
