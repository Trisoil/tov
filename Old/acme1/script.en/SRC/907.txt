Wow... Everything here 
is something I've 
never seen before.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
These aren't blastia, 
are they?

## POINTER 3

Correct. No blastia 
at all. We made everything 
here by hand.<PAGE>How about that? 
Pretty nice, huh?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
Ya mean ya little 
tykes made all 
this by hand?

## POINTER 5

Of course! We worked 
our butts off, hey!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
Wow, that's 
great. But what 
is this?

## POINTER 7

Seeing is believing, my 
friends! And you won't see 
it until you play it!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Play it? We don't 
even know how.

## POINTER 9

No worries, no worries! 
You'll pick it 
up quickly.<PAGE>Allow me to pick 
one of you to give 
it a test-run!<PAGE>Hmmmm...<PAGE>All right, let's go with Ms. 
Bouncy-bouncy Krityan.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
Me? I donâ€™t think 
I'd be very good 
at this...

## POINTER 11

Don't worry about it! 
That just means it'll 
be more fun for you!<PAGE>All right, right 
this way, then.<PAGE>Okay, just stand there 
for a sec...<PAGE>And now...
Cha-ching!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
That was...Ba'ul, 
wasn't it?

## POINTER 13

What you were imagining 
in your mind showed up 
on that very screen!<PAGE>I feel like that adds a bit of a game-like 
quality to it, don't you?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
I don't get it at all.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
Ya mean...if someone else's doin' 
the thinkin', something else'll 
show up on the screen?

## POINTER 16

Sorry, that's all for now! 
That was the last game machine 
that wasn't in use.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
Aww, what a buzzkill!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, no big deal, right? We 
can come back here some other 
time and play, right?

## POINTER 19

Yes, come whenever you'd like. You'll 
have your very own game machine, just 
for Ms. Bouncy-bouncy and her friends.<PAGE>Oh, but the next time you 
play, don't forget that 
you'll need chips, too!
