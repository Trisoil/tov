The shaggothim flowers all 
withered and died...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
...You were the one who destroyed 
the blastia here, weren't you?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Yes, that was me.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
I see... The reason for these flowers 
blooming like that was the aer imbalance 
from the blastia you destroyed...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
And in the coliseum, too...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
You heard what the man in the boat said 
about the fish around there, right?<PAGE>I looked into it, and it was all due to 
the blastia. So I did what I had to do.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
You're not mad?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
I'm plenty mad!<PAGE>But...it's in the past. I 
hate arguing about things 
that have already happened.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
...Sometimes I feel 
like she might be 
TOO understanding.
