Ah...you're 
<STR>(RIT) Mordio.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
You know me? You must be 
a mage from Aspio, then.

## POINTER 2

Wh-why have you come here?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Oh, I was just stopping by in the course of a journey. That's all.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Excuse me... Would you 
mind if I looked at 
that book you have?

## POINTER 5

What? This? Sure, 
I don't mind...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, it's Ifmunft Nepmayjup's 
"Discourses on Aer!"

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
What? You've heard of 
this book before?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
This book used to be in my house. I think it may've 
belonged to the person who lived there before me.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
...I see... Yes, I see...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
It was all full of codes that I couldn't understand, 
so I didn't find it all that interesting.<PAGE>I ended up giving it to the first person 
who showed any interest in it.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
Ifmunft Nepmayjup. 
That's Hermes. It 
was his penname.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
What?! Really?!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
...So that means 
Hermes used to 
live in Aspio?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
That's what it would mean, yes.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Keeping something important like 
that from us yet again...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
I'm sorry. I wasn't entirely 
sure of it until now.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
*Sigh* ...Well, whatever.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
What...is all this? I can't understand 
any of it at all... "Kdvkxosktzgr 
hrgyzog iuarj hk jgtmkxuay..."<PAGE>It looks like he just wrote letters at random...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
It's all in code. I thought 
about trying to figure it 
out a few times, but...<PAGE>This annoying type of writing is often 
used for taking down personal memos and 
the like. But not for research papers.

## POINTER 20

In the front of the book it says, "I dedicate this 
to my daughter." And then, "Try and read it."<PAGE>It seems that it was more of a challenge 
to his own daughter than a book 
of his own memos to himself.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
Yes, I think that's right.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
I see... What a ridiculous, 
foolish researcher.<PAGE>He didn't even know what 
the blastia he'd created 
were capable of.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(JUD)
Yeah...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
That's it... I'm going 
to take this book 
and decode it!<PAGE>Please, let me have this.

## POINTER 25

Sure, go ahead. It's not like 
I can read it, anyway.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
Once I've cracked the code, I'll find 
that daughter and give it back to her!<PAGE>Right. I'll show that blastia-researching bozo!

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
