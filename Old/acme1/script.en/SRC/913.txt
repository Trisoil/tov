Oh, <STR>(YUR)! Loitering 
around as usual, 
I see.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, good to see you 
too, Old Man. What 
are you up to?

## POINTER 2
Hanks
......
I didn't want to say 
this, but I've started preparing 
for the worst.<PAGE>I thought I'd look at this memento 
of my wife and reminisce about the 
good times while I still can...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Wait! The world isn't over 
yet! We'll do something to save 
it...just wait and see!

## POINTER 4
Hanks
That's quite nice of you to say, but 
I can't help feeling a little pessimistic 
when I look up in the sky.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
So you were talking with your 
wife about the happy times 
you had when she was alive?

## POINTER 6
Hanks
Laugh at me all you want. I'm 
not long for this world, <STR>(YUR). 
I'll be with her soon.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
I don't know if she'd feel like putting 
up with you up in heaven, what with 
the way you're being right now.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes! You should cheer 
up... You're not 
being yourself!

## POINTER 9
Hanks
I'm not being myself?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Everyone in town is always cheered 
up by your energy and spirit. This 
goes for me too, of course.<PAGE>But now it hurts 
to look at you...<PAGE>Look at everyone in the lower quarter! Even though they're having 
tough times, they're working hard...working for the future! The 
only way to guarantee that the end will come is to give up now!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(EST_P)'s right, 
Old Man. You're 
not yourself.

## POINTER 12
Hanks
Heh heh...<PAGE>Fwa hah hah...<PAGE>An old man like myself never 
expected to receive such a 
lecture from a young girl.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm, I'm sorry!

## POINTER 14
Hanks
No, no, I should be the 
one to apologize. It seems 
I misunderstood.<PAGE>You know, when you're angry, 
you sound just like my wife, 
when she was young.<PAGE>You even look like her, 
come to think of it.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
I do?

## POINTER 16
Hanks
Yes, you're her 
spitting image.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Are you sure? You don't 
think you're exaggerating 
a bit?

## POINTER 18
Hanks
You don't know what you're talking about, boy.<PAGE>That tiara you have looks 
like one I gave her 
a long time ago, too.<PAGE>Thank you. You've brought 
me back to my senses.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, no, not at all! I was 
just... That is, I like 
you when you're happy!

## POINTER 20
Hanks
What a nice thing to say...<PAGE>Please take this, as my 
way of saying thanks.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
But isn't this the memento 
of your wife...

## POINTER 22
Hanks
I'm sure she would've 
wanted you 
to have it.<PAGE>Please, 
take it.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
You really don't mind?

## POINTER 24
Hanks
Nah, it's okay. 
I want the young 
lady to have it.<PAGE>Even if I give away my keepsake 
of her, the good memories I 
have won't leave my heart.<PAGE>My memories are all 
that I need. So please, 
take this.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
I understand. But if you 
ever want me to give it 
back, just let me know.<PAGE>I'll take very, very 
good care of it. 
Don't worry.

## POINTER 26
Hanks
Thank you.
