Nobis! You shouldn't 
be out of bed...!

## POINTER 1
Nobis
Can't afford to lie about all day...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, you're really in great shape.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
You got your Everlight. Where is 
it you've gotta run off to now?

## POINTER 4
Nobis
I must find the secret text 
that details the process of 
Everlight refinement...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
What's so special about that?

## POINTER 6
Nobis
In its raw state as ore, 
Everlight is all but 
useless, of course.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Oh yeah?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
That's true. It's a metal, so you wouldn't 
be able to do much with it unless you 
removed all the impurities first.

## POINTER 9
Nobis
And Everlight must be refined according to 
a specific process. Our guild had the method 
written down in a secret manual...<PAGE>It was taken on a journey long ago, and its 
whereabouts remain unknown to this day.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
And you were going 
to try and find it?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
But why? Why would you put 
yourself at such risk?

## POINTER 12
Nobis
...It is for... For the 
sake of our guild... For 
the Soul Smiths...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
Just what're you goin' on about?

## POINTER 14
Nobis
...Our guild is facing a crisis 
that threatens its very survival.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
Survival? But you're one of 
the five master guilds!

## POINTER 16
Nobis
Thanks to the stability the 
barriers have helped create, 
weapons are no longer the 
valued items they once were.<PAGE>It has been many years since 
anyone joined our guild, and 
nothing will slow the aging 
of our oldest members.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
So what does refining Everlight 
have to do with that?

## POINTER 18
Nobis
In the art of crafting weapons, 
no ore is Everlight's equal.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
Now that you mention it, I think 
I remember reading that most 
famous weapons are made from 
very specific metals.

## POINTER 20
Nobis
For better or for worse, the world 
today is a calamitous place.<PAGE>Perhaps weapons we forge could 
play a role in restoring order to such a 
world, and glory to our once-great guild.<PAGE>Even though I have acquired 
the ore, without the manual, 
it is as nothing.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
Even still, you 
shouldn't overdo it...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
Does he look like someone 
who'll stay put just because 
you tell him to?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RAV)
He's borderline obsessed.

## POINTER 24
Nobis
...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
Guess I should've seen this coming. 
Okay, we'll go and find your 
secret manual for you.

## POINTER 26
Nobis
You...?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
Meanwhile, you stay put here, 
like you're supposed to.<PAGE>By the name of Brave Vesperia, 
brightest star in the night 
sky, we'll take the job.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(KAR)
Whoa, <STR>(YUR)! Did you plan on 
asking the rest of us...?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(JUD)
We are striving to live lives 
of justice, with punishment 
for the unjust, are we not?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(KAR)
Um, yeah.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RAV)
Didn't Rhianna say somethin' about 
her old man minin' that Everlight 
and makin' somethin' out of it?

## POINTER 32
<STR>(YUR)
Oh right, that lady you had 
a crush on who hired us 
to look for her necklace.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(KAR)
That's right, I'd forgotten 
about Miss Rhianna!

## POINTER 34
<STR>(EST_P)
Then maybe if we ask her about this, we'll 
get some idea of where to begin looking.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(YUR)
Let's go and find out.
