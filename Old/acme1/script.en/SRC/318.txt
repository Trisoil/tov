You can't open that 
without a key.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
I know.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Are you really going to return it?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Yes, I am. You got a problem with that?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Nope...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
You saw what happened in Nordopolica. 
This thing made it so I couldn't 
control my magic.<PAGE>The clear ciel crystal 
inside this box interferes 
with aer somehow.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Interferes with aer? How 
could a tiny box like this 
do something like that?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
I don't know. That's why 
I wish I could open this 
box somehow...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
There's a good chance that 
we'd be able to find a key 
for the box in Yormgen.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
For me, this doesn't have anything 
to do with <STR>(EST_P) wanting to 
return it anymore.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
So then you're going to look 
for the town of Yormgen that 
was mentioned in that diary?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
Yes, if I can...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
If you can?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
I can't leave <STR>(EST_P) 
behind.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Sure you can, if you want to.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
I'd like to leave her 
behind. But...I can't.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
Until now, she was 
so careful...how 
could she...<PAGE>She couldn't be serious about going 
alone into the desert...could she?
