What the...?!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Wait!

## POINTER 2

Thank you for the lovely story...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
The story...you mean 
the story that <STR>(EST_P) 
made up?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Who are you?

## POINTER 5

...I have dwelled at the base of 
this tree for many generations...<PAGE>If you wish to give me a name, 
you could refer to me as the 
flower maiden of your story.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
So you mean that really happened...?

## POINTER 7

Those children saw me, and 
I'm afraid that started 
an unfortunate rumor.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
You mean the story of the bride's ghost?

## POINTER 9

Yes...and I even dropped 
my veil...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, so this is yours. 
Let me give it 
back to you.

## POINTER 11

No...I shall let 
you keep that.<PAGE>Thanks to you, the unfortunate 
rumor was put to rest.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
But no...I mean, I was just 
making that story up...

## POINTER 13

No...I shall give you another 
token of my gratitude.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
Huh...?

## POINTER 15

I have given you a new ability.<PAGE>Perhaps it will 
help you protect 
your companions.<PAGE>Farewell...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
Ah...!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
...What...was 
that?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
An elemental spirit, I think.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? But I thought elemental spirits 
came from Entelexeia...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
There's a barrier blastia here. Which mean 
that there's a blastia core, which could 
be the source of an elemental spirit.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(EST_P)'s power put aer into 
the core, and that created 
an elemental spirit.<PAGE>Or perhaps the tree 
and the blastia did 
that by themselves?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm...very interesting.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
It sort of takes the flowers out 
of the equation, though...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
But don't you think the idea of a 
flower spirit is a little romantic?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
...I've decided...<PAGE>After our fight with the 
Adephagos is over, I'm going 
to become a writer.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(KAR)
Wh-whaaaa...!

## POINTER 27
<STR>(EST_P)
I want to be able to spread joy, like what happened 
with those children and that spirit.<PAGE>I want to make everyone 
happy like I did for the 
people in this town...

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Sounds good to me!

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
Sounds good to you? But <STR>(EST_P)'s 
going to be the...<PAGE>...Yeow!

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
All right, let's go.
