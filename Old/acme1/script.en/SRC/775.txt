Ah, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 1
Leblanc
What's all this commotion?!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Ah, top of the morning to you, gentlemen!

## POINTER 3
Boccos
<STR>(YUR) Lowell!

## POINTER 4
Adecor
You are no doubt behind all of this! Yet again, I saaay!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm...maybe I am, indeed.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
What? <STR>(YUR), you mean...

## POINTER 7
Leblanc
Urgggh! How 
insolent!<PAGE>You're under arrest!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Hey <STR>(KAR), old man. 
Let's get outta here.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Huh?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
Uh?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Get everything taken care of?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
Yes, thanks to you.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(RIT), what's in that bag?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Nothing at all!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
You can tell him. We're all accomplices 
to core theft now.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
What! What do you mean theft?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
Wait, you knew...?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RAV)
Ahh, I see. That's a 
blastia core, then!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
How the heck did I become a thief 
without even realizing it?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm sorry, <STR>(KAR)...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Hah hah! Let's get 
out of here before 
Leblanc comes back!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(JUD).

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
That is, uh, thank you. For 
not destroying that blastia.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
Oh. A surprising bit of humility, coming from you.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
But why did you do it? You 
didn't have any trouble destroying 
blastia before now.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(JUD)
I just wanted you to like me!

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RIT)
N-no way! You're 
joking, right?!

## POINTER 28
<STR>(JUD)
Yes.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RIT)
You...

## POINTER 30
<STR>(JUD)
When I was by myself, the only way I could stop them was by 
destroying them. But now I know that there are different ways 
of taking care of the the blastia, when I'm with friends.<PAGE>I can count on you, right?

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RIT)
S-sure.
