<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS19_001)This is Dahngrest, 
my hometown.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS19_002)Looks like a pretty lively place.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS19_003)Well, it's the second largest 
city after the imperial capital. 
It's run entirely by the guilds.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS19_004)I'd thought it would be more 
dark and dank, you know? 
Like a den of villains.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS19_005)That's just a prejudice people 
have about the guilds.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS19_006)I'm sure the bad reputation of the Blood 
Alliance is to blame for that.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS19_007)Yeah. Jeez, <STR>(YUR). You make 
it sound like I'm a villain.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS19_008)If you're a villain, what 
does that make him?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS19_009)Point taken.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS19_010)So, how should we go about 
tracking down Barbos?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS19_011)The best way is probably to stop 
by the Union and check there.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS19_012)The Union. A guild collective 
run by the five so-called 
"master guilds." ...Right?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS19_013)Yeah. The Union also serves 
as the city's government.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS19_014)But, how is this gonna work? 
Isn't Barbos' Blood Alliance 
one of the five master guilds?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS19_015)Which means if we lay a hand 
on him, we'll be picking a fight 
with the Union as well.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS19_016)...We won't know the answer to 
that until we ask the Don.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS19_017)The Don is the boss of 
the Union, isn't he?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS19_018)Yep. Don Whitehorse, leader 
of Altosk, the most powerful 
of the five master guilds.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS19_019)All right, let's go see what 
the Don has to say then. 
You know the way, right <STR>(KAR)?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS19_020)Hey wait, he's not the kind of 
person you can just meet... 
I don't really know if...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS19_021)Please?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS19_022)...Union headquarters is in 
the north part of town.
