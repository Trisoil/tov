<STR>(YUR)! You 
okay?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? What do you mean?

## POINTER 2
Ted
What do I mean...
What with 
everything that's happened...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Oh yeah... Things'll work 
themselves out, I think.

## POINTER 4
Ted
Really...?<PAGE>A lot of people have fled town, and everyone 
in the lower quarter has lost their spirit...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
I definitely don't feel the same 
energy here that I did before.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
A lot of things have happened 
since then...

## POINTER 7
Ted
Hey, <STR>(YUR). Do you think there's any 
way to get people here to lighten 
up? You know, like it was before.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm, good question. Maybe we could 
do something to refresh their spirits 
and take their minds off of things.

## POINTER 9
Ted
Hmmm...

## POINTER 10
Ted
I've got it! Let's have a footrace! 
You know, like the ones 
we always used to have.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, you mean the "Old Man's 
Race." That would definitely 
get people's blood pumping.

## POINTER 12
Ted
Then it's decided! 
I'm going to go 
tell everyone!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, <STR>(YUR). What's 
an "Old Man's 
Race?"

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Basically, it's 
a race through 
the city.<PAGE>There are two roles: one person runs, while 
the other plays a more strategic role.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Hmmm... And that's supposed to 
get people's blood pumping?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
You'll know what I mean when you see it.

## POINTER 17
Ted
I just told everyone. 
They're so excited!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
I'll bet they've all been looking 
for an excuse to have a race.

## POINTER 19
Ted
All right, let's 
do it!

## POINTER 20
Ted
Wow, that was really 
exciting!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
That was great! I 
had a great time 
just watching it!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
So <STR>(YUR), you don't 
ever run?

## POINTER 23
Ted
Nah, <STR>(YUR)'s much, much 
better at the strategic 
side of things.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, running is a pain in the butt, too.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RAV)
I think ya like tellin' others what ta do more 
than ya like bein' told what ta do yerself.

## POINTER 26
Ted
Let's do this again sometime!
