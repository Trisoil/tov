Are you...Mr. Seron?

## POINTER 1

Yes, I'm Yu Seron.<PAGE>Are you from the Union...?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, we're a guild, 
Brave Vesperia.

## POINTER 3
Yu
Brave Ves... Hmm, I haven't 
heard of you...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
Don't worry. We can handle it! You need 
people to deliver some stuff, right?

## POINTER 5
Yu
Yes...I'd like someone to take a 
book to an old friend of mine.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
A book?

## POINTER 7
Yu
Yes, quite an important 
one. It's a book that holds 
many memories for us.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
We'll make sure to take 
good care of it.

## POINTER 9
Yu
Please don't lose it. If 
that should happen...<PAGE>I'll have you pay compensation for 
the lost item through the Union.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(KAR) said don't worry, 
right? So don't worry.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
And who might this 
friend of yours be?

## POINTER 12
Yu
His name is Nobis Celestial. He's 
currently travelling, so I don't 
exactly know where he is...<PAGE>I think he's probably 
in one of the cities on 
Tolbyccia or Desier.<PAGE>Please take this crest.<PAGE>If you carry this with you, 
he should recognize it and 
call out to you himself.<PAGE>"A fiery soul into a sea of 
flames." You'll know it's Nobis 
if he says this to you.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Okay, got it...<PAGE>We accept this task in the name 
of the brightest star in the 
night sky--Brave Vesperia.

## POINTER 14
Yu
Thank you for your help.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
What was that thing you said 
at the end there that sounded 
like a magic spell?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
It's an oath for taking a new 
job. It's proof that you accept 
the client's request.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
Interesting.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
All right, let's go look for Nobis!
