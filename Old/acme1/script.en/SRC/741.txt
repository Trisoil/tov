You're still reading that book...?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
I've just gotten to a really good part...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
...Phew... Your dad was really 
a great man, <STR>(JUD).

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
Why do you say that?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Hermes had already deduced how elemental 
spirit conversion could be used.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
Yes... It's not hard to believe that 
someone as smart as he was would have 
been able to accomplish that...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
But not as something to use for the disasters 
that we're facing now, but rather, as a 
possibility for the far, far-off future.<PAGE>Long after humans have been wiped out, 
and probably after the Entelexeia themselves 
are gone from the world...<PAGE>When the planet Terca Lumireis is approaching 
the twilight years of its life...<PAGE>All aer on the planet will undergo 
spirit conversion, through mana.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
But right now, quite unexpectedly, 
spirit conversion is being 
done by human hands.<PAGE>Even though people...and the world itself...aren't 
ready for it to happen.<PAGE>Now we have to find a 
way to continue to do 
all of those things.<PAGE>Those things that people have used blastia and aer for 
so long to do that they take them for granted...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Yes... But this book goes 
into great depth about 
the intricacies of aer.<PAGE>If I used this and what I know to do some 
experiments with elemental spirits... <PAGE>...I might be able to come up with a method of creating 
a new type of blastia...one that doesn't use aer.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
Really...?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
His formulas are a little bit 
complicated...but I think I'd 
like to give them a try.<PAGE>A high-output model like a barrier 
blastia might be impossible, but...<PAGE>Anything is better than nothing, right?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
Yes. Of course.<PAGE>I'm sure you'll be able to do it, <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
I'm so impatient 
to get started.<PAGE>Maybe I'll just try an experiment or two right now...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
No, don't rush. We all have 
to stay in tip-top shape for 
the battles ahead, you know?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
Well, good night.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
All right. Maybe some 
sleep might be nice...
