## POINTER 0
<STR>(YUR)
So you weren't able to meet 
Phaeroh, after all.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
But I learned about some 
very important things.<PAGE>The Child of the Full Moon, 
and the Entelexeia...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
But the only new thing we learned 
was what those words mean.<PAGE>As for the reason Phaeroh's trying to 
kill you...it seems we won't know unless 
we go and ask him directly.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
But you heard what he was saying. 
If I go to meet Phaeroh, he'll 
just wipe me out.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
It looks like we'll never 
know the truth, then...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
After all this...<PAGE>It's like I'm being 
told that I should 
just give up...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
No, no way.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
...Maybe...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Huh...?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Maybe what I'm trying so hard 
to figure out...isn't really that 
important to know at all.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
What do you mean?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
If I'd never met you, <STR>(YUR), 
and I'd just kept living my 
life in that castle,<PAGE>I would have lived without ever knowing 
about the Child of the Full Moon, or 
the Entelexeia, or any of that.<PAGE>So maybe I could just go on 
living without knowing why 
Phaeroh wants me dead.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
So you're saying you should 
just go back to the capital?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
I think that's definitely 
an option.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
...If that's what 
you want to do, I 
won't stop you.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR)...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Our contract with you is null and 
void at this point, after all.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
...That's true.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
It's just...I don't really 
like hypothetical situations. 
They're not real life.<PAGE>And I'm not too good at 
pretending to forget things 
that I already know.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
If you can do that, then I 
don't have any problem with 
it. But can you really?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
Then, I...<PAGE>I can't do that, 
either.<PAGE>But I have no idea what 
I should do in this sort 
of situation...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
You want to know the 
truth, but you don't 
know what to do...<PAGE>...That'd be a good summary 
of your situation...right?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
Gotcha.
