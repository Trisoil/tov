I tell ya, thinking of a converter 
for aer, you're quite the thinker!<PAGE>That's our genius mage-girl 
<STR>(RIT). Yep, yep!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
...Well, I had a hint to go off of.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Come to think of it, you did say you'd 
investigated Zaude, didn't you?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Despite its amazing size, it 
wasn't running off of aer.<PAGE>Even though it was a barrier blastia 
to protect the entire world.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
A barrier blastia?! Oh yeah, they were protecting 
the world from the Adephagos!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
It seems that Alexei thought it 
was some sort of weapon...but that 
was a fatal error on his part.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
But the runaway aer was the cause for 
the Adephagos awakening, wasn't it?<PAGE>Ah, so that's why they would use a barrier 
running on power other than aer.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
But then, what sort of power was it using?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
...The Children of the Full Moon, perhaps?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
It was actually energy taken straight from them.<PAGE>Inside that giant core, it continued to power 
Zaude as a virtually perpetual formula.<PAGE>Most likely, the energy was taken in exchange for their lives.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
The light of life was extinguished from the Children of the Full Moon....

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
So that's what Myorzo's 
legend meant.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
According to Duke, they did 
it of their own free will. They 
wanted to save the world.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
They sacrificed themselves for the world... The Children 
of the Full Moon were protecting us this entire time.
