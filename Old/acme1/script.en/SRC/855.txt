Wh-what...?

## POINTER 1

...The last battle caused a 
rift to open up in space...!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
......!
Maybe we can go
outside from here!

## POINTER 3

Y-you cannot go outside! Th-the
only way out is to make it all the
way to the end, of course!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
The mysterious voice sounds
a bit more flustered than usual.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Looks like we can get 
out of here after all.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
Surely you're not suggesting that 
we go back after coming this far?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Sometimes the best strategy is to run.<PAGE>It might be a good idea to go 
back to recover our energy.

## POINTER 8

If you leave now, you'll have 
to start from the beginning 
the next time you enter!<PAGE>Do you still aspire to such folly...?!

## POINTER 9
Do you want to exit?
Do not exit
Exit

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
We're going to keep going.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
H-huh...? You want to keep going?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Do you really want to have to start all 
over again from the very beginning?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
I don't really see why we need
to ever come here again...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
But if we don't find out who the voice is,
<STR>(RIT) will be too scared to sleep at night.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
W-what are you talking about?!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
Are you saying you could just chalk 
it up to ghosts and forget about it?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
Th-there's no such thing as ghosts!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Ah, good. Then we can get moving.

## POINTER 19

Hee hee hee...
I admire your courage...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
We're going to step 
out for a bit.

## POINTER 21

W-wait...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
So, are we leaving 
or not? Come on!

## POINTER 23

Alas, they got away...
