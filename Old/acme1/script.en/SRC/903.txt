You won! Congratulations!

## POINTER 1
Leblanc
Huff... Huff...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
It looks like he's speechless.

## POINTER 3
Ted
I didn't expect you'd have 
any speed or stamina, but 
that was a nice job!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Well, with the right direction, anyone can 
do well... Isn't that right, Leblanc?

## POINTER 5
Leblanc
Huff... Huff...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Eh? What's 
the matter?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
A weakling like myself 
could never have won without 
your help, <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Such powerful words of 
thanks, Leblanc! You're 
embarrassing me!

## POINTER 9
Leblanc

Huff...!
Huff...!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Enough thanks, Leblanc. Let's 
do this again sometime.

## POINTER 11

amazing!

## POINTER 13

<STR>(YUR), I did 
it! I won!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Good job!

## POINTER 15
Ted
That was some great 
synergy out there.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
I had fun running! And 
<STR>(YUR) did a great job laying 
out a path for me.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, I didn't do much at all. 
You're just being modest.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
Was that a compliment, 
<STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Of course it was! Don't 
look at me like that!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
Ahh...
Yes, I thought 
it might have been...

## POINTER 21
Ted
I know how you feel, 
young lady.<PAGE>Every now and then, 
<STR>(YUR)'ll surprise you.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
Hee hee. <STR>(YUR)'s not too good at 
saying the right thing sometimes.

## POINTER 23
Ted
Exactly! He could've just 
said "congratulations," 
but noooo, not <STR>(YUR)...<PAGE>So I'll say it. Congratulations, 
young lady!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(EST_P)
Thank you.

## POINTER 25
Information

Princess."

## POINTER 26
<STR>(KAR)
I did it, I did it! 
I won the race!

## POINTER 27
Ted
Wow, your small body makes for 
fast turns... That was amazing!

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, that's Captain 
<STR>(KAR)'s most useful 
trait in racing.

## POINTER 29
Ted
His stamina was impressive, as well! It seemed 
like he's not the type to give up easily!

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm...I guess you're right. 
He works pretty hard.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(KAR)
Oh, come on... You're 
making me blush!

## POINTER 32
Ted
I think if you work even harder, 
you'll become a truly remarkable 
person someday.

## POINTER 33
<STR>(KAR)
Wow, really? You really 
think that?

## POINTER 34
Ted
Yes, I do.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(KAR)
I see... I see! Then maybe 
this success was just 
the first of many!

## POINTER 36
<STR>(YUR)
Come on, Ted! If you inflate his 
ego any more it's gonna pop!

## POINTER 37
Information
<STR>(KAR) received 
the title "Runner 
in Training."

## POINTER 38
<STR>(RIT)
Hee hee! You can always 
count on <STR>(RIT) 
for a sure win!

## POINTER 39
Ted
Wow, you're really smart. Your 
teamwork was perfect... It was like 
you were sharing one brain.

## POINTER 40
<STR>(YUR)
Well, she is a genius mage, after 
all. She didn't have trouble with 
what I was telling her at all.

## POINTER 41
<STR>(RIT)
Of course I didn't! Who do you 
take me for, an amateur?

## POINTER 42
<STR>(YUR)
No, no, not at all!

## POINTER 43
Ted
Your running style is fun 
to watch... You just glide 
past everything!

## POINTER 44
<STR>(RIT)
Well, I was trying to 
slip through as efficiently 
as possible.

## POINTER 45
Ted
So it was more like 
you were slipping 
than gliding!

## POINTER 46
<STR>(YUR)
That's pretty 
nice.

## POINTER 47
Information
<STR>(RIT) received 
the title "Slippery 
Runner."

## POINTER 48
<STR>(JUD)
Oh! It looks like I won.

## POINTER 49
<STR>(YUR)
It's no wonder, <STR>(JUD_P). You've 
got long legs and no small 
amount of stamina.

## POINTER 50
Ted
And the two of you 
seemed to have great 
chemistry, too.

## POINTER 51
<STR>(JUD)
Oh really? Maybe our hearts 
are connected...

## POINTER 52
<STR>(YUR)
What do you mean by that...?<PAGE>You're really good at assessing the 
situation at hand, <STR>(JUD_P). It was 
fun telling you what to do, too.

## POINTER 53
Ted
Come to think of it, this is the first 
time we've had a Krityan win the race.

## POINTER 54
<STR>(YUR)
Looks like a first-class dragon rider 
can be just a speedy on foot.

## POINTER 55
Information
<STR>(JUD_P) received 
the title "Mach 
Rider."

## POINTER 56
<STR>(RAV)
I won! 
Damn, I'm 
good!

## POINTER 57
Ted
You were great!

## POINTER 58
<STR>(YUR)
I have to say, your 
running style was 
pretty inefficient.

## POINTER 59
<STR>(RAV)
Well, that's just what happens 
when ya get old.

## POINTER 60
<STR>(YUR)
But you seemed to 
excel in other categories 
quite well.

## POINTER 61
<STR>(RAV)
Yeah, when you get older, you 
start to think more about how 
you can impede your opponents.

## POINTER 62
<STR>(YUR)
When it comes to annoying 
one's enemies, you're the 
tops, old man.

## POINTER 63
Ted
But you've gotta be covered 
in bruises after all of 
that bumping into things!

## POINTER 64
<STR>(RAV)
Black and blue, and proud to be so!

## POINTER 65
<STR>(YUR)
Are you so old that you 
can't feel pain anymore?

title "Black and 
Blue Runner."
