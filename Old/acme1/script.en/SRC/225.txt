<VOICE>(VS21_016)Now shut up for a while!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_017)What's the deal...?

## POINTER 2

<VOICE>(VS21_018)Please, I've got to get out of here!

## POINTER 3

<VOICE>(VS21_019)It's always somethin' with you, isn't it old man?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_020)It's not polite to point sharp 
objects at your elders.

## POINTER 5

<VOICE>(VS21_021)Yah!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_022)Hey...!

## POINTER 7

<VOICE>(VS21_023)That's enough.

## POINTER 8

<VOICE>(VS21_024)Damn it...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_025)...A woman... 
And she's Krityan...?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_026)Are you all right?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_027)Heh, sorry.

## POINTER 12

<VOICE>(VS21_028)Well...after all, you did 
help Ba'ul back there.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_029)Ba'ul?

## POINTER 14

<VOICE>(VS21_030)Yes, my friend.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_031)Oh, you mean that monster.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_032)So tell me. What are you going 
around destroying blastia for?

## POINTER 17

<VOICE>(VS21_033)...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_034)Not a big deal if you don't 
feel like talking about it.

## POINTER 19

<VOICE>(VS21_035)I'm afraid it's not as impressive 
as you might think.

## POINTER 20

<VOICE>(VS21_036)I'm destroying them because I want to.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_037)You're right, I'm not all that impressed.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS21_038)So that's why you mashed 
up Barbos' blastia too.

## POINTER 22

<VOICE>(VS21_039)Yes, but I didn't finish the job.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_040)And can you just let this one go?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS21_041)...There wouldn't be any fun in 
destroying something like that.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_042)...Huh.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_043)Hey, why don't we work 
together a little longer?

## POINTER 27

<VOICE>(VS21_044)Hmm... It's true I wasn't able to finish 
off the blastia on the roof.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_045)Okay then.

## POINTER 29

<VOICE>(VS21_046)So what do we do?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_047)Hmm... There's one way I was thinking 
we could get out of here.

## POINTER 31

<VOICE>(VS21_048)Well, if you think it might work, 
what's the harm in trying it out?

## POINTER 32

<VOICE>(VS21_049)I always say, 
"Those who can, should."

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_050)Okay, just go along 
with me on this.

## POINTER 34

<VOICE>(VS21_051)I'll just follow your lead.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_052)Don't worry. It's a little 
nerve-wracking working with 
a pretty lady, though.

## POINTER 36

<VOICE>(VS21_053)......

## POINTER 37
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_054)Oh, that is it!

## POINTER 38

<VOICE>(VS21_055)... !

## POINTER 39

<VOICE>(VS21_056)Pipe down!

## POINTER 40
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_057)Cut it out!

## POINTER 41

<VOICE>(VS21_058)You cut it out!

## POINTER 42

<VOICE>(VS21_059)I said that's enough!

## POINTER 43

<VOICE>(VS21_060)I've had it up to here with you!

## POINTER 44
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS21_061)Somebody get me away 
from this psycho!

## POINTER 45

<VOICE>(VS21_062)So I'm gonna have ta 
teach ya a lesson, huh...?

## POINTER 46

<VOICE>(VS21_063)Oof!
