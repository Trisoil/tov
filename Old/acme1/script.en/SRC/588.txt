Y-you there! It's curtains for...<PAGE>Oh, wait...

## POINTER 1
Adecor
We're in the middle of carrying out 
a secret, I say, secret mission...!

## POINTER 2
Boccos
Adecor...! Our investigations 
of anti-imperial activity 
are strictly confidential!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
...You might want to reacquaint your boys 
here with the meaning of the word "secret."

## POINTER 4
Leblanc
Idiots...!

## POINTER 5
Adecor
Beg, I say, beg your pardon, Sir!

## POINTER 6
Boccos
Apologies, Sir!

## POINTER 7
Leblanc
What did I do to deserve this...? As 
you can see, I've got no time for 
small talk with the likes of you!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
What's the deal? Those extremists 
causin' problems for ya again?

## POINTER 9
Leblanc
Yes Sir, Captain <STR>(RAV) SIR! 
They're up to more mischief 
than ever before!

## POINTER 10
Adecor
I say, we've had reports of 
them slinking and sneaking 
around the lower quarter!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
Well then, I'm sure you'll get the job done.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Good luck to you.

## POINTER 13
Boccos
I never dreamed we'd receive the praise of 
the Princess and the Captain in person!

## POINTER 14
Leblanc
Thank you for this gracious kindness!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
The extremists, huh? Those are the guys 
who plant bombs, hurt people and put the 
town in a general state of panic, right?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
The very ones. We hadn't heard much from 
them for a while, but it sounds like 
they're up to their old tricks again.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
...Are there really people 
who do things like that?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah. I can understand that they aren't 
thrilled with the empire, but they've 
got no right involving innocent people.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
Unlike the guilds, they're a pretty disorganized 
bunch. People with chips on their 
shoulders tend ta be that way.<PAGE>Makes it hard ta put a stop 
to 'em once and for all.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(JUD)
Well, it isn't like we have any 
clues ourselves. Shouldn't we 
just leave it to the Knights?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
S'pose you're right.

## POINTER 22
Leblanc
You can count on us, 
Your Highness! Sir!
