<STR>(RIT)
Wha! No, no, you've 
got it all wrong!<PAGE>I'm just feeling a little 
under the weather, is all!

Ho ho! Feel free to come back for a 
rematch when you're feeling better!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Sh-shut 
up, you!!

Ho ho! All that anger isn't 
going to help you win!

## POINTER 6

I'm telling you, give up now! You're 
just going to keep losing!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
I can't stand it, I can't stand
