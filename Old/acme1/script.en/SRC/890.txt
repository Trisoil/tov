Welcome! Oh, it's you... 
You're the Don's 
friends, right?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
Yeah, I guess ya could say that.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, the Don worked with 
this tavern, didn't he?

## POINTER 3

Hmmm? No, not exactly. 
He just came here 
often to drink.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Maybe this was his safe haven...
Where he could relax...

## POINTER 5

Exactly. We always worked hard, 
so the Don would have a place 
to take his mind off of things!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
Keep up the good work. If 
there's anything we can 
do to help, let us know!

## POINTER 7

Oh, really? In that 
case, I have a favor 
to ask of you.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
You don't waste any time.

## POINTER 9

To tell the truth, the girl who used 
to help us around the tavern set off 
on an excavation trip or some such.<PAGE>That leaves us in a tight spot--we're 
short on help. I don't know when 
that girl's coming back, either.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
So ya want us to take 
her place an' help ya 
with yer customers?

## POINTER 11

Right. It would only be a temp 
job, so I wouldn't be able 
to hire you officially.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
No, that's fine. We 
don't want to become 
official employees.

## POINTER 13

Oh, I see. Too bad. Anyway, 
it's hard work, so I'd 
be paying you, as well.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
Hey, Gald is Gald. 
Might as well, eh?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Looks like the Old Man is his 
usual money-grubbing self...

## POINTER 16

I only need one person 
to help. Feel free to choose 
whoever you like.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Knock yourselves 
out, guys.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR), you're not 
going to help?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
A rude waiter like <STR>(YUR)'d be 
bad fer business. The customers 
would take off in no time.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
You've got a point, old man.

## POINTER 21

Thanks, I appreciate the help.
