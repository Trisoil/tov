Hmm...it looks like they 
aren't following us.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
Yeah, but they went and sealed 
off a dangerous place like this 
just to isolate Nordopolica.<PAGE>These guys mean business.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Seriously, even bringing 
monsters to help?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
Whatever they're 
doing, it can't be good.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
I can't believe that 
<STR>(FRE) would order 
something like this...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Sometimes orders comin' down from the 
top don't make sense. The meaning can 
get lost going down the chain of command.<PAGE>When a brigade gets big and 
famous enough, things can 
start to get outta hand.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
You certainly know a lot 
about these things. Makes 
sense for someone in Altosk.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Things can end up like that no 
matter what the organization.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
What worries me...is 
how much of a hand 
<STR>(FRE) had in all this.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
I'm sure we'll get a good 
understandin' of that as soon 
as we can get to Nordopolica.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
That's right.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
But we should 
be on our guard.<PAGE>Even though I find it hard to 
believe that they've conquered 
Nordopolica by force...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, I think the Palestralle 
would have a problem with that.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Sorry, <STR>(RIT). You won't get 
much time to investigate 
the aer krene.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Grr... Oh well... I don't have 
much choice. It'd be bad 
if they caught up to us.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Exactly. Come on. 
Let's get going.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(YUR) sure is enthusiastic.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
He won't say it, but 
I reckon he's just 
worried about his friend.
