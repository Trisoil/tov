Wh...what's that?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Gyaaaah!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Th-that's one of the monsters 
that attacked Halure village!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
A survivor, 
huh?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
If we leave it here it'll 
surely go back and try to 
attack Halure again...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
But Halure has the barrier protecting it now.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Even so, how are the people of Halure supposed 
to sleep at night with beasts like this crawling 
around just outside the barrier?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Wh-what the heck! It hardly 
put up a fight!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
But there could be a dozen more 
just around the corner...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
N-no worries, seriously!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Well, let's just hope there aren't 
too many more where it came from.
