What's the matter, boss?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Mmm... I don't know if I 
like you calling me that.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
The boss is the boss! What would 
you have me call you instead?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Just call me...whatever you called 
me before. This "boss" thing seems 
a little over the top.<PAGE>It makes me feel silly 
to have you calling 
me that...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Don't you think you'll 
get used to it?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
Well, maybe...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Well, you know way 
more about guilds 
than I do, right?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
I guess...<PAGE>The boss of a guild has 
to stand as a role model 
for everyone else.<PAGE>I wonder if I could be that 
great of a person...?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Come on, it's not like you're expected to be the best boss ever 
from the very beginning. You can take it a little at a time.<PAGE>For now, our guild has 
a job to complete.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
You're right. First we 
need to take <STR>(EST_P) 
to meet Phaeroh...<PAGE>...But do you think we'll be able to meet him?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Our guild's job is to figure 
out a way to meet him.<PAGE>If we can't meet him, we won't get 
our reward, and people will lose 
confidence in our abilities.<PAGE>That's all there is to it.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
I think we may have picked something a 
little too tough for our first job...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
It's more of a challenge that way. And our 
reward will be that much bigger, too.<PAGE>...Let's make the best of it.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Y-yeah...
