The Hundred Man Melee!<PAGE>We're currently accepting applications! ♪<PAGE>You wanna give it a go?

## POINTER 1

Choose a level to challenge! Choose
one challenger! Then all that's left is
to pay the entry fee and you're in!<PAGE>It's as easy as pumpkin pie! ♪<PAGE>Challengers must cut down
all their fierce opponents! 
Slice, dice, clang, kerpow!<PAGE>Fierce opponents will pop up like popcorn!<PAGE>The number and type of opponents 
you'll face will vary depending 
on the level you choose!<PAGE>And since it's boring for the audience if you 
just mosey along lazily, we've put in a fun 
little time limit to prod you on a bit!<PAGE>If you manage to beat all of your opponents 
in the time limit without getting beaten 
yourself, you'll be a wiiiinner!<PAGE>We have some fabulous prizes for winners! But if you get 
defeated before you beat all of the opponents, you get 
nooothing! And of course, we get to keep the entry fee!<PAGE>But we'll be glad to heal 
you, so no worries!<PAGE>Ferocious opponents will keep 
coming at you, and you can change
your equipment during the battle.<PAGE>But, you need to hand over the items
you have and we'll hang on to them.<PAGE>Please use the items we
provide when you're inside
the arena.<PAGE>Oh, you can steal items from your
opponents and use those too, but<PAGE>we will exchange all items left
at the end of the battle with
the items we hang on to.

What? I can't believe you
don't have enough Gald!<PAGE>We don't have business
with someone like that...

## POINTER 3

Oh, you'll participate? The 
Thirty Man Melee, right?<PAGE>That level should be a walk in the park! 
All of the opponents are small fries! ∀<PAGE>Who will be participating?

## POINTER 4

Umm, beginners...should start 
at the beginning. You need to 
try the Thirty Man Melee first.<PAGE>Otherwise, you could get in 
over your head! And we wouldn't 
want that, would we?

## POINTER 5

Oh, you'll participate? The 
Fifty Man Melee, right?<PAGE>That level can be a little 
tough! I don't think 
you'll die, though. ∀<PAGE>Who will be participating?

## POINTER 6

You haven't beaten the Fifty Man Melee and 
you'd already like to try for eighty? Getting 
a little ahead of ourselves, aren't weee?<PAGE>You think the Eighty Man Melee will have 
a better prize, don't you? I can see right 
through your clever little scheme!<PAGE>Let's take our challenges one at a time,
shall we? That way we make more money! ♪

## POINTER 7

Oh, you'll participate? The 
Eighty Man Melee, right?<PAGE>So you're going to go for it...
No, I won't stop you... The coliseum's 
profit is more important...<PAGE>Who will be participating?

## POINTER 8

Oh, you'll participate? The 
Hundred Man Melee, right?<PAGE>Might as well, right? 
It's the biggest, 
the best!<PAGE>We finally managed to gather a hundred 
people to fight in the battle, but we 
haven't had any challengers at all...<PAGE>...Even though it's the fight that makes
the most money for the coliseum...<PAGE>Who will be participating?

## POINTER 9

Oh, I'm sorry! We're still making 
preparations for that one.<PAGE>You can't have a Hundred Man 
Melee without a hundred men, 
and we're still short!<PAGE>Arranging all of these events 
isn't easy, you know!<PAGE>We should be opening it up soon, though, 
so come back and challenge it later!
