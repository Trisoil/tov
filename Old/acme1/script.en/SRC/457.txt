<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS46_001)...So it did end up hittin' 
somethin', after all.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS46_002)Thankfully it missed hitting 
any of the towns.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS46_003)You guys sure you're all right?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS46_004)No, I hurt all over, but...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS46_005)<STR>(EST_P)'s in trouble. 
I can't just lie around.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS46_006)Yeah. What he said.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS46_007)What's our next move, though?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS46_008)If the road to Ehmead 
Hill is out, couldn't we 
take a boat around?

## POINTER 7
Teagle
<VOICE>(VS46_009)I'm afraid not.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS46_010)A little while back the Knights 
came and took any boat that 
could make a long trip.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS46_011)Thanks to them, the 
harbor's dead empty.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS46_012)Damn, at a time like this...

## POINTER 9
Teagle
<VOICE>(VS46_013)...Well, there is one way, but 
I'm just not sure how I feel 
about recommending it to you.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS46_014)If it'll get us through, 
let's hear it. We've got to 
get to the capital fast.

## POINTER 11
Teagle
<VOICE>(VS46_015)I'm afraid it'll end up 
taking you a fair bit 
out of your way, but...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS46_016)If you go north, just before 
Ehmead Hill, there's a thin 
strip of coastline.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS46_017)It'll eventually come to a dead 
end, but in this season it freezes 
over and becomes an ice floe.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS46_018)The Blade Drifts of Zopheir.

## POINTER 13
Teagle
<VOICE>(VS46_019)Right. If your lucky, you 
should be able to make your 
way across the floe on the ice.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS46_020)If you cut through there, 
you'll come out in the 
middle of the continent.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS46_021)The Blade Drifts 
of Zopheir, huh...?<PAGE><VOICE>(VS46_022)I heard nobody goes there--not 
even fishermen--because of 
the stories.

## POINTER 15
Teagle
<VOICE>(VS46_023)You're also gambling on nature 
here, so there's no guarantee 
you'll be able to get through.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS46_024)If that's our only way, then 
we'll have to go for it.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS46_025)Okay, let's do it.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS46_026)...Thanks for your help.

## POINTER 18
Teagle
<VOICE>(VS46_027)Least I can do. There wouldn't 
be much left of this family if 
it weren't for you all.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS46_028)Only thing I'll ask is that 
you don't disappoint my boy.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS46_029)You got it!
