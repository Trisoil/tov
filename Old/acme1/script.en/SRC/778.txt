<STR>(JUD)
All right, I'm done.

## POINTER 1

Hmm... I lost. I'm 
impressed. So the 
legends are true...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
......

## POINTER 3

I admit defeat. As promised, I'll 
return my winnings, and I'll 
stop coming here for good.

## POINTER 4

Hmph. Looks 
like I won, 
doesn't it?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
Yes. I lost.

## POINTER 6

But you know, I'm tired of this 
place. I don't need the money 
here anymore, either.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
What's gotten into you?

## POINTER 8

Dunno. I guess a new casino 
is just calling my name, 
and I've gotta answer.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
You're a good sport.

## POINTER 10

Eh? I was able to play against you. 
That's the most important thing.

## POINTER 11

Until we meet again.

## POINTER 12
Kaufman
Amazing! Thank you for your 
help! Thank you so much!<PAGE>H-how did you do it? Who the 
hell are you, anyway?!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
I'm just an average, run-of-the mill Krityan.

## POINTER 14
Kaufman
You may've lost the 
game, but you did 
great! Thank you!

## POINTER 15
Kaufman
Now, for your reward...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
I was surprised at how quickly he left. I thought 
he'd put up more of a fight, or something.<PAGE>Are all gamblers like that?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
Who knows? Not me.<PAGE>But he played honorably. 
It was a fun match.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, <STR>(JUD)! You bet something while 
you were playing against him, right?<PAGE>I couldn't hear what it 
was. What did you bet?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
I told him if he won, he'd 
never have to pay for food 
or drinks here again.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
...Huh?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
He earns his living by 
gambling, after all.<PAGE>A bet of anything else would've 
been an insult.<PAGE>His very way of life was on the line!

## POINTER 22

Madam President! Madam President! A strange 
man is going around to all of the food 
stands and taking food without paying!<PAGE>And he keeps saying 
"put it on my tab." 
What do we do?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(JUD)
Uh oh.
