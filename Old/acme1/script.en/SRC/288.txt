It'll be nice if we don't run 
into the mermen, won't it?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Hmph, that's pretty 
wishful thinking.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
You're quite the pessimist 
for your age, girlie.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
I'm just a realist.

## POINTER 4
Kaufman
Anyway, thanks for your help. It looks like 
we're going to make it there on time.

## POINTER 5

Yeah, Leviathan's Claw was going to beat us there 
if we hadn't found an escort for the ship.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Leviathan's Claw, huh? That's a name 
I seem to be hearing a lot lately.

## POINTER 7
Kaufman
Oh? They're the guild that's specializing 
in sales of hoplon blastia.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
Oh, that explains the situation in Heliord...

## POINTER 9
Kaufman
Lately they've been 
trying to steal our 
clients from us.<PAGE>If we weren't able to cross the 
sea, they would've swiped up another 
one of our major customers.

## POINTER 10

Still, I can't help but wonder 
where those slimeballs are getting 
their product from.

## POINTER 11
Kaufman
Indeed. Hoplon blastia isn't exactly 
the easiest thing in the world 
to get one's hands on.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
...You don't think...the empire is behind this...?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
No, that couldn't be...it's mages that are 
supervising the blastia distribution...

## POINTER 14
Kaufman
Ah, right on time.

## POINTER 15
Tokunaga
Everyone, be careful!

## POINTER 16
Kaufman
You're true to your reputation. 
I was right to bring you along.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
I tell ya, Brave Vesperia doesn't have any shame 
in working an old man down to the bone!<PAGE>Even while I'm looking for apatheia and 
doing all sorts of other things...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Apatheia? Isn't that what you were 
looking for back in Nor Harbor?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
That's right.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
That's nothing but a fairy tale.<PAGE>I researched it a while back, but eventually 
I realized that there's simply no way 
it can theoretically exist.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
I'm well aware people 
think it's a fairy 
tale.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
Why are you looking 
for it?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RAV)
Well... Because the 
Don told me to.

## POINTER 24
Kaufman
Well then, we've got some business 
to talk about. I'll leave the navigation 
to you, Tokunaga.

## POINTER 25
Tokunaga
Actually, Madam President, would 
you mind if I handed over the navigation 
to them for a while?

## POINTER 26
Kaufman
Ah, of course. We've made much better 
time than I thought. We could even afford 
to make a side trip or two.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
With a ship, we can go practically 
anywhere we want.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(EST_P), I know you want 
to look for Phaeroh...<PAGE>But don't you think we have more important 
things to do for the moment?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(EST_P)
Do you think...?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
I'll do what I want. 
Don't worry about me.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
We just started our guild...we 
should err on the safe side. 
Don't you think, <STR>(KAR)?

## POINTER 32
<STR>(KAR)
Y-yeah.

## POINTER 33
Tokunaga
All right then, I'll leave 
the navigation to you.
