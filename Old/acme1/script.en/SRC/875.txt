Hey.

## POINTER 1
Rich
...Hmpf...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
So you're looking at that sword again...the 
one that belonged to someone you respect?

## POINTER 3
Rich
...This sword belonged to His Highness
Regin, the brother of the Emperor.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Regin...isn't that the "King of Adventure" 
you mentioned earlier? The one 
you named your inn after?

## POINTER 5
Rich
...A while back, His Highness led an 
expedition into the wilderness...<PAGE>...It was called the Regin Expeditionary Force...<PAGE>...My father was a member 
of that force...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
So is the expeditionary 
force still active?

## POINTER 7
Rich
...You don't know...?
...You haven't 
heard what happened...?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Sorry, I'm not too knowledgeable 
about famous historical figures.

## POINTER 9
Rich
...The Regin Expeditionary Force set out to defeat the 
world's Giganto Monsters, but they were annihilated...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Ah, <STR>(KAR) mentioned something about that...
So you've set out to avenge your father?

## POINTER 11
Rich
...To avenge my father...
No, it's nowhere near that noble...<PAGE>...If I defeat the Giganto Monsters, I 
can finally go back to my hometown...<PAGE>...At least, that's what I planned on doing...<PAGE>But these days, we've been reduced 
to mere wanderers...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
What's so bad about that?

## POINTER 13
Rich
...I must defeat the Giganto Monsters...
...Otherwise, we'll never be free...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
The Giganto Monsters means too much
to you to be able enjoy the wandering life, eh?

## POINTER 15
Rich
......

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
...I see.
