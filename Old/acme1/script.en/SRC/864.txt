Oh, hello. We've met before 
somewhere, haven't we?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
You helped us out 
back in Capua Nor.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
That was back when 
you'd been captured 
by Alexei.

## POINTER 3

...You can use healing artes?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Huh...? You can tell?

## POINTER 5

All healers have a characteristic mark 
on their left thumb, from which their 
artes are released when they're used.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
There's a little dark spot...
You could tell from just this...?

## POINTER 7

Doctors have to be observant. Plus, I'm 
a practitioner of healing artes as well.

## POINTER 8

Grandma suddenly started 
feeling ill...

## POINTER 9

It's too late, Doc! I'm not 
long for this world...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh no...
This is serious...

## POINTER 11

Hold on. A healer can't let 
herself get flustered when there 
are sick people to help.<PAGE>Ma'am, could you tell me what 
sort of discomfort you're 
having, and where it hurts?

## POINTER 12

My side hurts, like it's
being squeezed real tight...
And my fingers feel all stiff...

## POINTER 13

Hmmm... Well, let's 
have a look...

## POINTER 14

I feel all better! 
Thank you, Doctor!

## POINTER 15

Oh, you don't need to thank 
me. This is my job.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
You were using your healing artes precisely, 
only on the parts of her body that 
needed it. That takes some skill.

## POINTER 17

It can actually be harmful to focus one's 
healing artes on healthy parts of the body.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
R-really?

## POINTER 19

If a healer works too hastily, she 
can cause her patient undue stress, 
and worsen their conditions.<PAGE>A healer must always 
be calm and focused.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
I, I see..Please excuse 
my ignorance.

## POINTER 21

No, not at all! You're still learning. The path to 
becoming a healer is a tough one, to say the least.<PAGE>Please, come and visit again. There 
is much I'd like to teach you.
