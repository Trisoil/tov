I haven't seen my 
buddy for a while.<PAGE>The work here is tough, and we're

We came to this land looking 
for a new way of life.<PAGE>And once this city is completed, they 
say we'll get ranks, as well as monetary 
compensation for our trouble!

If you loiter around town causing 
problems, I'll have you arrested 
and taken into custody!

This city is brimming 
with hope! Every day it 
grows more and more!
