All these rooms look the 
same. I wonder if they're 
all like this.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
I'm going to go check out what's ahead.

<STR>(RAP).

We don't really have time to be dawdling...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
It's okay. Relax.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
As we thought, the rooms 
all look the same from 
here on out.<PAGE><STR>(RAP)'s sense of smell doesn't seem 
to be working too well here, either.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
I see. We can't afford 
to get lost in here.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
Here, use these.<PAGE>Let's make a map as we go.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Y-you're always so well prepared!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, I'm good with maps. 
Leave it to me.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
We'll be in a lot of trouble if you mess up, you know!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
D-don't say that, come on...everything'll 
be fine, probably...
