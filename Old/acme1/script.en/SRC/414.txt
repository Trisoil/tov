Good day!

## POINTER 1

Good day, my sister.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
<STR>(JUD).

## POINTER 3

I'm Tort.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
You wouldn't happen to know 
anything about Myorzo, would 
you? I'd like to go there.<PAGE>I need to know where Myorzo 
is located...and how I 
can get there.

## POINTER 5
Toth
Even if you reach the city, there won't 
be anything for you to see there. But what 
do you plan on doing there, anyway?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
Is not a Krityan's interest 
in her own ancestral city 
reason enough to go?

## POINTER 7
Toth
That is an acceptable reason. But 
I'm afraid I don't know anything 
about where it could be.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
I've heard your name 
before, Tort.<PAGE>You help guide those Krityans remaining 
on earth up to the heavens.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
Will you not tell me because 
these humans are with me?

## POINTER 10
Toth
Our ancient law states that we cannot 
show anyone but our brothers and 
sisters the way to Myorzo.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
Shouldn't it be a matter of whether 
they can be trusted, rather than whether 
they're Krityan or not?<PAGE>At the very least, these 
humans can be trusted.

## POINTER 12
Toth
...I shall ask once more.<PAGE>Why do you seek 
Myorzo?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
The world is headed towards some bad 
things, all thanks to blastia.<PAGE>We want to go to know what 
happened in the past, and 
how we can stop it.<PAGE>We want to help everyone, 
not just the Krityans...how's 
that?

## POINTER 14
Toth
...Very well.<PAGE>I do not know if you'll find the 
answers to your questions, but 
I will show you the way.<PAGE>But there is one condition.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
What's the condition?

## POINTER 16
Toth
To get to Myorzo, you must
travel to Egothor Forest.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
The Egothor Forest? On the continent 
of Hypionia, isn't it? I've heard 
of it before...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
Yes, the sacred land of the 
Krityans is located there.<PAGE>So that's where the 
door to Myorzo is...

## POINTER 19
Toth
Yes...but those lands are currently 
being trampled under the feet of 
an unknown group of people.<PAGE>They have not only invaded our sacred land, but they 
have also brought strange blastia with them.<PAGE>I don't know what they're up 
to, but it can't be good.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
So if we go to Myorzo, we have 
to do something about them?

## POINTER 21
Toth
Exactly. We need you 
to restore peace to 
our sacred land.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
What's happening?

## POINTER 23
Toth
Once you have driven out the 
interlopers, ring this bell.<PAGE>The door to Myorzo 
will open for you.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
...Thank you.

## POINTER 25
Toth
May the road rise up to meet you, sister.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(JUD)
And you, as well...<PAGE>Let's go back to where 
everyone's waiting.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah.

## POINTER 28

You're searching for Myorzo...?<PAGE>That's the name of the city that 
they talk about in the Krityan 
legends. That's all I know.<PAGE>Location?
I don't know where it is.<PAGE>And even if I knew, I don't think
it will be of any good to tell it to 
someone other than a Krityan.
