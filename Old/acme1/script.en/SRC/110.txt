Might I help heal 
your wounds?

## POINTER 1

Oh my, you can use 
healing artes?<PAGE>Why, that would be excellent! 
...But I'm afraid we don't 
have very much money...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
No no, I don't need any money.

## POINTER 3

Amazing... The pain is all 
gone. Th-thank you. Thank 
you so very much.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Ah, uh, please, don't mention it...

## POINTER 5

My heavens, what amazing 
healing artes you have...

## POINTER 6

How can we ever thank you?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
No, really, think nothing of it.

## POINTER 8

What a humble young lady. I 
wish the Imperial Knights could 
follow your example.

## POINTER 9

Not a chance! The Knights refuse 
to lift a finger to protect 
us from the monsters!

## POINTER 10

Well, I guess the empire 
couldn't care less what 
happens to us here.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
No...th-that's not true...

## POINTER 12

Ah, but that one knight sure 
was different, wasn't he?

## POINTER 13

Yes, that young man. If 
not for him, we would 
have all been lost.<PAGE>The barrier weakened earlier than usual 
this year, and we were attacked before 
the guild could come to protect us.<PAGE>There was a knight who happened to be passing 
through our town on a pilgrimage. He and his 
brigade drove off all the monsters.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
A knight on a pilgrimage...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Was this knight named 
<STR>(FRE), by any chance?

## POINTER 16

Yes, his name was <STR>(FRE) Scifo.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
Is he still in the city?!

## POINTER 18

No, he left the village afterwards in search 
of a mage who could fix the barrier.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Do you know where he went?

## POINTER 20

It looked like he was headed east, but 
beyond that I couldn't tell you...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
I see.<PAGE>So we can wait here, and 
<STR>(FRE) will come to us.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
Looks like we've caught up with him. 
Don't you feel better now?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes...I won't be able to relax until 
I see him, but I guess I feel better.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
I think I'll go have a look at this 
famous tree. Wanna come with?

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
Ah, yes!<PAGE><STR>(YUR), you don't mind? You're okay not 
going after the blastia core thief?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
I can spare enough time to 
look at a tree, at least.
