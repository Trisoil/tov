Do you have an
outfit that can attract
any kind of male?

## POINTER 1

Attract any...
Are you gonna wear it?<PAGE>How about this?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Oo, it's lovely!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
That's no good.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Nope, no good.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
No good?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
Why? It's 
so cute...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
If cute was what we were 
going for, you could've just 
stuck with what you have on.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Right. In other words, 
it's not sexy enough.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Again with the sexiness...<PAGE>Clothes that would look 
sexy on this young lady...

## POINTER 10

Mmm... Let's see...<PAGE>If you brought me a soft tail, basilisk 
scale and a small bird feather, 
I could make you something nice.<PAGE>You should be able to get all 
of the items from monsters 
on the outskirts of the city.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
I guess we have no 
choice. Let's go.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Urgh, looks like this is going to 
be more trouble than we thought...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Come on, hurry up!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
Stubborn, isn't she?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
...You can say that again.
