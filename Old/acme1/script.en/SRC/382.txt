<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR), please wake 
up! <STR>(YUR)...!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? Oh... I was really 
zonked out, huh...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
Good mornin', sleepyhead... Though it's 
more "good afternoon" now, ain't it?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Oh... Hey, old man.
You're back...<PAGE>...What about <STR>(KAR)?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
Haven't seen 'im since 
I left the Union. I reckon 
he's still there.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
I hope he's okay...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Well, old man, since you're back, 
does that mean everything's 
settled with the Union?<PAGE>Did you see the Don?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Well, about that...<PAGE>As soon as the Don heard what 
happened with Harry and Nordopolica, 
he left the Union.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
By himself? That's not like 
him. Where did he go?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
Well--and this is just my intuition, mind ya--<PAGE>I think he's headed for 
Leviathan's Claw's compound, 
the Manor of the Wicked.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
What?!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
But Yeager is the head 
of Leviathan's Claw! 
That's so dangerous!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
Well, I don't think Yeager'd try 
anything against the Don.<PAGE>If they went up against the 
Union, they could lose all of 
their business, for one.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
So why did the Don go out there...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
So anyway, I'm sorry, but 
the Don's left the city.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Well then, should we go to Leviathan's 
Claw's compound?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
You believe the old 
man's intuition?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
If the Don's going up against Leviathan's 
Claw, we can't very well sit around 
and twiddle our thumbs.<PAGE>There's no guarantee the 
scum won't try to attack him.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
...Well, all right, then. I'm not 
really one for waiting, anyway.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
...<STR>(EST_P), will you wait here?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
I...I'm going with you.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(EST_P), don't overdo it. Are 
you sure you're up to this...?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes... I'm absolutely 
fine.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(EST_P)...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RAV)
...So, you all know where 
the Manor of the Wicked is?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
I figured you knew, old man. 
Aren't you coming with us?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RAV)
Well yeah, I guess I am.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Well then, it's decided. We'll 
just go pick up <STR>(KAR), and...

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
What the...?!

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
It sounded from the 
direction of the bridge...

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RAV)
Uh oh...

## POINTER 32
<STR>(EST_P)
Let's go and see!
