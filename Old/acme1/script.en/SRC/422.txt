<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_010)Man... This is amazing!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_011)Hey, look...!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS40_012)They're all Krityans...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_013)A-are they welcoming us?

## POINTER 4

<VOICE>(VS40_014)Now this is a surprise. 
These visitors really are 
from the outside!

## POINTER 5

<VOICE>(VS40_015)Well, well, so it 
was you who called 
on Myorzo?

## POINTER 6

<VOICE>(VS40_016)And what is this? How 
strange. What curious 
ornaments you wear.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_017)Hey, it's not polite 
to stare, you know.

## POINTER 8

<VOICE>(VS40_018)How were such children as yourselves 
able to come here?

## POINTER 9

<VOICE>(VS40_019)Is this monster an Entelexeia, 
perhaps?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_020)It's Ba'ul. Have you 
forgotten him?

## POINTER 11

<VOICE>(VS40_021)Oh, you're the one who 
descended to the earth 
some years ago, right...?

## POINTER 12

<VOICE>(VS40_022)...I believe... <STR>(JUD), yes 
<STR>(JUD) was your name.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS40_023)There was something you 
had to attend to, and...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_024)Are you about finished? 
We would like to meet 
with the elder.

## POINTER 14

<VOICE>(VS40_025)Please, feel free 
to do as you wish.

## POINTER 15

<VOICE>(VS40_026)He may be out for a walk again, though.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS40_027)Okay, so theyâ€™re a bit weird.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS40_028)That's actually called "rude."

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS40_029)You're one to talk, <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_030)All Krityans are 
pretty much like that.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS40_031)Like what?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_032)Oh, easygoing, unafraid. We 
are dreamers and optimists, 
for better or worse.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_033)So is the elder 
like that, too?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS40_034)How should I put it...? 
He's the perfect elder 
for weird people.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS40_035)Sounds like quite a 
unique individual. I'm 
tryin' ta be nice, here...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS40_036)This should be interesting...
