It's a piece of clothing I made from the fangs 
and tusks of a monster that I slew recently.<PAGE>It had the most amazing 
golden tusks...

## POINTER 35

of gold...?

I thought it wouldn't look right on 
anyone who wasn't strong enough, but 
I think it will suit you just fine.

<STR>(KAR)
Huh...? You 
mean...
