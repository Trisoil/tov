How can a lady of my stature 
possibly be locked in a wretched 
place like this?! Oooh!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Man, she hasn't changed a bit...

## POINTER 2
Mimula
What? Who's there?<PAGE>...Oh, you're that guild from earlier.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Looks like you've done well for yourself.

## POINTER 4
Mimula
You're the ones I hired to 
find Sebastian! I knew he wouldn't 
just leave me here!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? No clue what you're going on about.

## POINTER 6
Mimula
Sebastian sent you, 
didn't he?! To help 
get me out of here...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
We're not actually 
here to break you 
out of jail, no.

## POINTER 8
Mimula
But... Then he's abandoned me to 
the wolves after all! And he calls 
himself a faithful servant!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Wow, he just took off...

## POINTER 10
Mimula
That's right! That failure of 
a man! He grabbed up every penny 
I had left, and went away!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
My heart goes out to ya, dearie. Honest.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
So, you had a 
brother named 
Cumore, right?

## POINTER 13
Mimula
So what if I did?! All of this is 
thanks to his childish mischief!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Did you ever see something like 
a secret manual among his things?

## POINTER 15
Mimula
A secret manual...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
It sounds as though you have heard of it before.

## POINTER 17
Mimula
...I might just tell you about it 
if you can get me out of here.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
All right, we're going.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
Huh...?

## POINTER 20
Mimula
Don't you want to know 
about the manual?!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
If it means being used by someone 
like you, I'll take my chances 
on something else.

## POINTER 22
Mimula
A-are you sure that's 
what you really want?!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
It's not what we want, 
but it's not our place to 
let you out of there.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
You see how it is.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RAV)
Sorry, muffin.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(JUD)
This is what they call karma, I believe.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 28
Mimula
What?! Oooh!

## POINTER 29
<STR>(EST_P)
Maybe Sebastian 
has the manual 
with him.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
Sounds like he's the one 
we need to bring in.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, but where do you 
think he ran off to?

## POINTER 32
<STR>(RAV)
It's a wide, wide world, after all...

## POINTER 33
<STR>(RIT)
Could he really have gotten 
that far away, though?

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
He could be almost anywhere 
if he's gotten on a boat.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(KAR)
Hmm, a boat... Let's check 
the ports, then.
