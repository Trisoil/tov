Well, if it isn't my favorite 
guild. You guys have been 
keeping busy lately!

## POINTER 1

You're bound to start getting 
offers on your own before 
long, I'd wager.<PAGE>Here to find a job?

## POINTER 2
Accept job?
Accept job
Decline offer

## POINTER 3

Well, whenever you're in need of 
work, feel free to stop by. I 
should be able to hook you up.<PAGE>If you can manage to get 
jobs without our help, 
more power to you!

## POINTER 4

Well, how does this sound?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
...I've forgotten something terribly 
important. Please go and fetch it. 
-Markham of Ruins' Gate

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
An absent-minded client, hmm?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Seriously, can't he just 
go get his own stuff?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
There must be some sort of 
extenuating circumstances.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah, there's gotta be. Plus, 
this would be an official job.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
A job request from Ruins' Gate... 
They were the ones behind 
that trouble at the Coliseum...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
We fell completely 
for Yeager's act.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Don't remind me about 
stuff like that, old man.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
But we defeated 
Yeager, so...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
So things should 
be okay now, right?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
...I hope so.

## POINTER 16

Got your game plan set? 
Payment's set at 5500
Gald. How 'bout it?

## POINTER 17

If I had to put money on it, 
I'd say any Ruins' Gate people 
would be at Union HQ. <PAGE>They'll fill you in 
on the nitty-gritty.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Got it!

## POINTER 19

I see. Well, if you feel like 
doing some work, let me know.

## POINTER 20

Oh, the job I mentioned last 
time is still open. Would 
you like to take it?
