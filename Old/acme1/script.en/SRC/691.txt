Master!

## POINTER 1
Drake
Ah, Princess, it's been a while. 
Are you in good health?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. Master, you look 
quite well, yourself.

## POINTER 3
Drake
It seems you've traveled to a great 
many places since last we met.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes! I've seen and heard so many things...it's 
been an amazing experience.

## POINTER 5
Drake
But was that experience really 
necessary in order for you to 
take the imperial throne?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
What do you mean...?

## POINTER 7
Drake
You've been cavorting about with people 
of questionable character, without any regard 
to proper behavior or principles.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Questionable character, huh...

## POINTER 9
Drake
Have you given any thought to whether or 
not these have been the right actions 
for a candidate to the imperial throne?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
But Master, you said that I needed to 
have a wide range of experience...

## POINTER 11
Drake
There's nothing wrong with 
broadening your horizons.<PAGE>The problem is your own actions.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
My own...actions...?

## POINTER 13
Drake
It's a question of whether or not you've 
been conducting yourself in a manner fitting 
of the sacred role of empress!<PAGE>I'd like you to reexamine the actions that you, 
yourself have taken since you left the castle.<PAGE>And consider whether or 
not those were truly the 
correct actions to take.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
What a self-righteous old geezer...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
I didn't notice that attitude the last time 
we met him. Is he always like that?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, Master Drake has always been very...strict. 
I'm pretty used to it, though...<PAGE>...But really, he might 
just be the reason that 
I'm traveling with you.<PAGE>I mean, I want to prove myself to him...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
That's just a guess, right?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm sorry, actually...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
No, it's fine if you're just guessing. It's true 
that you want to prove yourself to him, right?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
All right, then you should set him aside and 
give him a piece of your mind someday!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
Okay.
