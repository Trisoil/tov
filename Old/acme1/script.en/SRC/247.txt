What, you're not asleep?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Nah. I've been trying to think of a name for our guild.<PAGE>I'm going to think of something really cool.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Sure, I can't wait.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Hmm?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
I was thinking about this...we made 
our guild without first swearing allegiance 
to its laws, didn't we?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, but did that earlier today, 
right? So no worries.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah.<PAGE><STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
What is it?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Did you just make those 
laws up, or did you hear 
them somewhere?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
They just came to me. Why, were they no good?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
No, not at all. It's just...those were the 
exact same laws I'd been thinking of.<PAGE>...I'm really happy that I was able 
to make a guild with you, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Hah hah. What a thing to say...don't get all mushy on me.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
Ha ha, I...oh!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Wh-what now?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
I thought of a name!<PAGE>The Super Ultra Courageous Braves!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Ha ha ha. That sounds like a name Captain 
<STR>(KAR) would come up with, definitely. 
Let's go with that, then.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
Right!
