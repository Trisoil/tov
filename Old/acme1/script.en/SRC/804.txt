Everyone, thanks so much for 
your help! I don't know what 
I would've done without you.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Think nothing of it! 
I'm sure you would've 
done the same for us.<PAGE>And it seems like everyone 
enjoyed themselves while 
they worked, too.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
I didn't...

<STR>(RAV)
Speak fer yerself...

## POINTER 4

It was great! 
I learned so 
much, too.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
It was hard work, but 
it wasn't so bad.

## POINTER 6

We can't thank you enough. 
Ah, now for a token of 
our appreciation...

The clothes you're 
wearing are also 
yours to keep.

## POINTER 8

Thank you!

I'm happy 'bout the complimentary passes, really I am...but 
my bones ache so much, I feel like passin' out... I can't 
say I'm too thrilled 'bout these clothes either...

Look on the bright side, <STR>(RAV). You've got the 
satisfaction of a hard day's work, and you've 
even got some nice new clothes to wear!<PAGE>All I got was a 
towel to go into 
the bath...

<STR>(RAV)
Young'un, you'll see 
someday... This is all 
part o' growin' up.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Walking around in a towel 
is part of growing up...?
