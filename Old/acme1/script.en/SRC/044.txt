The dungeon is up ahead.
There's a knight held
captive there now.<PAGE>No one is allowed to
enter beyond this point.

## POINTER 1

That old man down at the cellar
will tell you like it is, if the food
tastes bad.<PAGE>On the other hand, he won't
say a word even if it tastes
good. That bastard.

## POINTER 2

It's tough cooking for that old man.
He gets in a foul mood when there's
no meat in his food.<PAGE>You know, stuff like pork, beef, chicken,
lamb, horse, boar, and such...

## POINTER 3

That old man down at the cellar
won't eat anything cold. He says
it gives him a stomachache.<PAGE>For that matter, he won't eat fried
food either. I guess you have to watch
what you eat when you're his age.

## POINTER 4

like you.
