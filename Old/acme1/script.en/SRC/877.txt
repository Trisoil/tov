Karen
That's a map, isn't it?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. I was just thinking 
about all the different 
places we've traveled to.

## POINTER 3
Karen
Oh, I'm so jealous!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
But hasn't your traveling 
taken you to many different 
places as well?

## POINTER 5
Karen
Well, we stay away from towns 
and strange places, so...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, really?

## POINTER 7
Karen
Yes... A carriage operating an 
inn would look pretty out of place 
in a city, don't you think?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
Perhaps...

## POINTER 9
Karen
Yes...and we stay away from dark forests, 
deep gorges, and the like... Such 
destinations are far too dangerous.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
Ah...

## POINTER 11
Karen
...Could you maybe tell a little about 
the different places you've been to?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
The places I've 
been to? Ummm...

## POINTER 13
Karen
Yes, please. I'd love to hear.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
Well, then...
First off, 
there's the capital...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
...And then, we left the 
mysterious village and 
continued on our way.

## POINTER 16
Karen
...Wow. You've had 
quite a trip!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
Well, we still have a good ways left 
to go...
Ah, it's getting late...

## POINTER 18
Karen
Oh! I'm sorry! I completely 
lost track of time!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
No, it's okay!

## POINTER 20
Karen
Perhaps if you ever come by 
again...you might be able to 
tell me some more stories?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, of course. 
I'll come again.

## POINTER 22
Karen
Hee hee, I can't wait to 
hear what happens next!â™ª
