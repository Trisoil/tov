It's huge 
up close.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
The tree's flowers should 
blossom any day now.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, I wish 
I could see it 
in bloom.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
I know how you feel. There's something about the 
image of a tall tree vibrant with blossoms and 
protecting the city that's so...romantic.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
You know, I'm going to stay here 
and help heal the injured.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Hmm, if you're going to heal something, 
maybe you could heal the barrier itself?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
What do you mean?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
When monsters come again, more 
people are gonna get hurt.<PAGE>Those kids we just saw 
could be among them.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
That's true, but I have no idea 
how I could heal the barrier.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
What you need to heal is this tree. 
It wouldn't be in this condition just 
because some monsters attacked it.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
You think there's 
some other reason?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
I think there's gotta be.

## POINTER 12

What are the two of 
you doing over here?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
We're trying to figure out why the 
tree has withered like this.

## POINTER 14

I don't know if you'll make much progress 
on that one. The knight <STR>(FRE) couldn't 
figure out the reason either.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, <STR>(KAR)! <STR>(KAR), 
we need your help!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
...What are you talking about?

## POINTER 17

It seems these two are trying to figure 
out the reason the tree's withered so.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Oh, is that all?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
What do you mean, "is that all?"

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
I know the reason. It's why 
I was in the forest looking 
for the eggbear...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? What are you talking about?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
Look closely at the ground. 
Notice the strange color?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
That color is where the ground absorbed the 
blood of monsters who attacked the town.<PAGE>That blood has been poisoning 
Halure's tree.

## POINTER 24

What! The monster blood? 
I had no idea...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(KAR), you really know your stuff, don't you?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(KAR)
...It was 
nothing.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
Is there anything we can do 
to get rid of the poison?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(KAR)
I know a way, but...well, 
no one believes me.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
Come on, try us.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(KAR)
I think we'd be able to do it 
if we had a panacea bottle.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
Maybe we can get one 
in the General Store.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(EST_P)
Let's go, <STR>(YUR)!
