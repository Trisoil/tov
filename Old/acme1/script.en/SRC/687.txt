I'm glad to see that you're

Let's go.

## POINTER 2

All right.

Do you really have time

<STR>(YUR)
We can't afford to make any mistakes. 
We have to be careful about things.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(FRE)
That doesn't sound 
like you, <STR>(YUR).<PAGE>Aren't you the one who's always 
acting irrational and reckless?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, I think you're thinking 
of yourself, <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 7
<STR>(FRE)
I can't imagine you'd be 
hesitating at this point, so...
What is it that you need?<PAGE>It is just some encouragement?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)

<STR>(YUR)
Your work can wait?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(FRE)
I can't think of anyone who'd make 
a better practice partner for you.<PAGE>And it appears Captain Schwann prefers 
to use a bow to fight, anyway.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
I appreciate the help. I'll 
take you up on your offer.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(FRE)
Excellent.
