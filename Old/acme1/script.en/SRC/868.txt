Ah, Doctor, thank you for 
your help the other day.

D-doctor... Y-you 
mean me...?

## POINTER 2

Yes, of course. You 
treated me in the hospital 
the other day.<PAGE>You're not usually working 
in the hospital 
though, are you?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
N-no...
I'm usually 
out traveling...<PAGE>But you know, I'm 
not really a Doc--

## POINTER 4

Hey, what's up?

## POINTER 5

This is the doctor at the hospital 
I was telling you about.

## POINTER 6

Oh, I didn't think she'd be this 
young. Maybe I'll go and pay 
you a visit sometime soon.<PAGE>My shoulder's been hurting 
me a bit lately, y'see.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Ummm... But I'm not...

## POINTER 8

Oh, so this is the 
famous doctor girl?

## POINTER 9

Yeah, it's her! Thanks to this miracle 
worker, I'm the very picture of health!

## POINTER 10

I see! Keep 
up the good 
work, Doctor!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
R-right...

## POINTER 12

Thanks again, Doctor!

## POINTER 13

If I feel sick, I'll be sure to come and see you!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
I... But... You see...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Looks like you're developing quite a fan club, <STR>(EST_P).

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
Maybe you should start
collecting magazines to
put in your waiting room?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
This is a bit of a pickle...
