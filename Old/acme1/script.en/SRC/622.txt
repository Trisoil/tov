## POINTER 1
Irmine
I'll warn ya, I can get downright 
mean on an empty stomach...

## POINTER 2
Irmine
Whoo boy. What 
is it? Whatâ€™s 
it gonna be?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
You'll just have to wait until it's ready.

## POINTER 4
Irmine
If it tastes bad enough, I might hafta keep 
my mouth shut for the rest of my days.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Here we go. Give 
this a taste.

## POINTER 6
Irmine
Let me see here... I 
dunno... Looks sorta 
gross from here...<PAGE>*Munch, munch, munch*...

munch, munch*...<PAGE>Phew...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
How was it?

## POINTER 8
Irmine
Huh? Oh, yeah,

up. Nap time.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Hey, wait a sec--

## POINTER 10
Irmine
ZZZZ...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
That's a pretty neat trick. Sleepin' 
standin' up like that...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
What is with this guy...?

## POINTER 13
Irmine
Waitin' for me ta fall asleep, 
huh? Well it won't work!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Now you listen to me...

## POINTER 15
Irmine
...Oh well, I guess 
you've earned it.

## POINTER 16
Irmine
Those're my notes on how 
ta refine Everlight.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
Whoa, that came out 
of nowhere...!

## POINTER 18
Irmine
Now I'll show ya what happens ta people who 
try ta put one over on me in my sleep!<PAGE>Try me! Age ain't nothin' but a number, 
and I'll go toe ta toe with you 
youngins any day of the week!<PAGE>I'm gonna...!<PAGE>...Sleep just a bit more.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
...Wow. That was...special...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(EST_P)
I feel like I could use a nap myself...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
But... These 
notes... It's 
all here...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
So then, this is the real manual?! 
I thought it would be more 
impressive than this.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
We should be able to find out for 
certain once we get it to Nobis.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
Let's take it with us then, 
and go back to Mantaic.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
He's probably beside himself 
with waiting, at this point.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
All right, finished. 
Give that a taste.

## POINTER 27
Irmine
Let's see here... *Munch, 
munch, munch* ...Bleah! 
Vut da heow ith dith?!

## POINTER 28
<STR>(RAV)
Now now, grandpa. It's impolite 
to talk with food in our mouth...

## POINTER 29
Irmine
*Gurgle, glug, burble*... Pfah! 
...Think I'm gonna hurl!

## POINTER 30
<STR>(KAR)
*Munch, munch*... Come on, this is pretty good.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah... Definitely not as 
bad as he's saying...

## POINTER 32
Irmine
Fools!<PAGE>The path ta culinary perfection is narrow and fraught with danger 
on all sides! This slop lacks heart! Back ta the kitchen with ya!

## POINTER 33
<STR>(YUR)
You're calling our food slop just because 
it doesn't suit your picky palate? 
You've got some nerve, gramps...

## POINTER 34
<STR>(KAR)
Let's try again, but make something 
else this time around.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(RAV)
We'd better make sure ta find out 
just what sorta stuff he likes.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(EST_P)
...Um, when did this become 
about pursuing culinary 
perfection, anyway...?

## POINTER 37
<STR>(RIT)
Don't ask me...
