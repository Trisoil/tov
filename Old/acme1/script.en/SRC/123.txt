Man, those guys are a pain in the neck.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
I wish we could wait here 
for <STR>(FRE) to come back...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Who's this <STR>(FRE) person?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
He's an Imperial Knight that 
<STR>(EST_P)'s got a crush on.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(KAR)
What?!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
I don't have a crush on him!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
You don't? Ohh, I get it. You 
two are already a thing then?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
No, it's not like that at all!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Well, anyway, we'd best be 
getting away from the town.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, you're right. We wouldn't 
want to cause trouble for 
the villagers.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Do you know where this <STR>(FRE) guy went 
off to? You could follow after him.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Didn't they say he'd 
gone off to the east?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, they did.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
I'd like to get to 
Aspio somehow...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Anyway, let's get out of here before 
the goon squad shows up.

## POINTER 15

Please wait.

## POINTER 16

You deserve a reward for restoring our tree.
Please stop by at my house.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, please don't mind.

## POINTER 18

I will be waiting at
my house. Please come.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
Uh, wait...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
A reward? What do you say?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Well, I guess we can't ignore 
his offer and leave.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
I wasn't really sure what I 
did back there. I don't think
I deserve anything.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Let's just stop by at the mayor's house.
We can still decline his offer there.
