<STR>(YUR)! Is that you, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? Who're you?

## POINTER 2

You don't remember me? I sure as heck-fire 
remember you! It's Hachette!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Not that it's easy to recognize someone 
when they've got a mask on.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, wow! You look different 
from how I remember. I didn't 
realize it was you.<PAGE>Haven't you gained weight?

## POINTER 5

Ouch! It's nice to see you too, <STR>(YUR)...

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Looks like the mask had nothing to do with it!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Is this a friend of yours, <STR>(YUR)?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Hachette joined the Imperial Knights
at the same time as I did.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
This old man is gonna 
go have a little walk.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Huh, how come?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
The older ya get, the harder it is to 
stomach little reunions like this.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
...All right. See ya later.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
That armor color is the same as 
Leblanc's knights, isn't it?

## POINTER 14

Yep! I'm in the Schwann Brigade!<PAGE>To tell you the truth, I'm pretty glad they 
didn't assign me to the <STR>(FRE) Brigade.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
You didn't want to work with <STR>(FRE)?

## POINTER 16

Well, it would be tough working under him, since 
we started off training to be soldiers together.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
That doesn't seem like the sort 
of thing <STR>(FRE) would care about.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
You've got that right, <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
<STR>(FRE)'s all about advancing in his career, isn't he?

## POINTER 20

It's pretty crazy for a non-noble to 
make captain at such a young age.<PAGE>Me on the other hand...thanks to all 
the goofing off I did with you, <STR>(YUR), 
I'm still nothing but a lowly peon.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
What sort of things did you two do?

## POINTER 22

We used to skip training 
and sneak into the dining 
hall to grab snacks.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, and then we'd sneak into 
the warehouse to switch bodhi 
blastia for nicer ones...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
Sounds like a whole lot of sneaking!

## POINTER 25

It's true. We had our fair share of youthful indiscretions.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
<STR>(YUR)'s still up to his old tricks, though.

## POINTER 27

Ha ha, I've heard 
as much. Go easy on 
<STR>(FRE), would ya?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, yeah. Don't goof off 
too much on the job!

## POINTER 29

Oh yeah, <STR>(YUR), you've been 
traveling around, right?<PAGE>You think you might be able to 
stop by Capua Nor and tell my 
folks that I'm doing well?<PAGE>They live in the inn, so you can't miss 'em.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
Sure, I'd be happy to. See ya later, Hachette.
