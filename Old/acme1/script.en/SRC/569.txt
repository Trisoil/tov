I never really noticed how 
deep the water is here...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
So the client dropped her 
necklace right down here...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Then, we dive in to 
get it, I suppose?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Even if you jumped in, 
I doubt the necklace 
is there anymore.<PAGE>Everlight isn't all that heavy
as far as metals go, so yeah. 
I'm sure it's drifted downstream.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
...Well, that would mean it's lying somewhere 
on the bottom of the ocean about now.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAP)
*Whine*

## POINTER 6

I'd be careful if I were you.<PAGE>The current's pretty crazy around here, 
thanks to the ocean tides. If you fell 
in, you'd be swept off in a jiffy!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
The tides? This isn't the sea, though.

## POINTER 8

The water in this river is a mixture of ocean water 
and fresh water that runs down from the mountains. 
All of the rivers around here are like that.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Wow, really...
I had no idea...

## POINTER 10

Come to think of it, the body of the magistrate 
that they say was dumped into this 
river washed up over in Heliord.<PAGE>That just goes to show you how far the 
current can carry things that fall in.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
...Sounds like starting this search 
in Heliord might not be a bad idea.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Thanks for your help, sir.

## POINTER 13

Huh? For what...?
