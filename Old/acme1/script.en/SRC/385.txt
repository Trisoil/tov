<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_015)I'm guessin' this is the 
Manor of the Wicked.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_016)It's so heavily guarded...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_017)Shh. They're arguing about something.

## POINTER 3
Droite
<VOICE>(VS36_018)What part of "let us in" are 
you having trouble with?

## POINTER 4

<VOICE>(VS36_019)Like I said, your timing just 
seems a little too perfect.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_020)Don't you have anything to prove
who you say you are?

## POINTER 5
Gauche
<VOICE>(VS36_021)You know what? Actually, we don't. Let us through.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_022)The Don is here. We don't 
have time to sit and chat.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_023)So the old man did 
come here...

## POINTER 7

<VOICE>(VS36_024)Didn't you go looking for proof 
that the Hunting Blades were 
after that dragon rider?

## POINTER 8
Gauche
<VOICE>(VS36_025)I told you, we received word that 
the Don was headed here before we 
could arrive at Mt. Temza.

## POINTER 9
Droite
<VOICE>(VS36_026)We couldn't very well ignore 
news like that, could we?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_027)The Hunting Blades are 
out to get <STR>(JUD_P)?

## POINTER 11
Droite
<VOICE>(VS36_028)What are you waiting for?!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_029)You won't be any use 
to Yeager if we have to 
give you a beating.

## POINTER 12

<VOICE>(VS36_030)Humph...

## POINTER 13

<VOICE>(VS36_031)We'll let you through, but 
not without an escort. You 
don't mind, I hope?

## POINTER 14
Gauche
<VOICE>(VS36_032)Whatever, just let us in.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_033)What luck.â™ª Now there's less 
guards ta worry about.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_034)Guess we'd better strike 
while the iron's hot.

## POINTER 17

<VOICE>(VS36_035)Wh-who the hell are you?!

## POINTER 18

<VOICE>(VS36_036)Hey!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_037)Nice, <STR>(RAP)!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_038)I think we're still in the clear.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_039)So let's make with 
the gettin' inside.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_040)Why do you think the Hunting 
Blades would be after <STR>(JUD)?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS36_041)If they're looking for 
apatheia, maybe they want 
the dragon she was riding.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_042)If he's an Entelexeia, 
he might become an 
apatheia like Belius.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_043)...I mean...when he dies.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_044)Which means Harry's request 
wasn't the only reason they 
wanted ta take Belius down.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_045)They want those apatheia 
somethin' bad.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_046)<STR>(JUD_P) might be in trouble, 
but we should help the 
Don out first.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_047)Especially with those two charming 
young ladies in there.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS36_048)Sure. We should be on our way.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_049)...I'm just worried about <STR>(JUD).

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_050)So you'll be going 
to Mt. Temza?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_051)But the Don...

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_052)We're practicing deciding 
for ourselves. Remember?

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_053)Let's move.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_054)I'm coming too!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_055)She'd be upset if I left 
the Don like this to 
go looking for her.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS36_056)I can just hear her 
saying, "My, what did you 
think you were doing?"

## POINTER 33
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS36_057)...Don't worry about 
that lady. She's tough.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_058)All right, let's get the old 
Don out of this place.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS36_059)Looks like we've found one 
more thing we can't ignore.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS36_060)Okay!
