<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS37_058)So...you are aware that this 
place was the ground on which 
the Great War was fought.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS37_059)Yeah. We heard from 
the old man here.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS37_060)The Great War was 
sparked by a type 
of blastia.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS37_061)What?!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS37_062)This was not a blastia that 
had been excavated.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_063)It had been constructed in 
the city of Temza using a 
new type of technology.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_064)The Hermes blastia.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS37_065)Hermes blastia...?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS37_066)I've never heard of it...<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_067)And if you say it was newly built...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS37_068)The Hermes models were 
even more effective at 
converting aer into energy.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_069)They were intended to...revolutionize 
the technology of blastia.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS37_070)But something went wrong.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS37_071)The blastia using these 
Hermes-type formulas required 
massive quantities of aer.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_072)The aer krene began producing 
abnormal amounts of aer in
order to compensate.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS37_073)That would mean the end,
not just of humanity, but 
all life on this planet!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS37_074)Just like we saw at Keiv Moc 
and the Weasand of Cados. Wouldn't 
like ta see that happen everywhere.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS37_075)The Entelexeia realized the 
dangers of the Hermes blastia 
before the humans.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_076)And they moved to destroy them.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS37_077)Which created a conflict 
that grew until it eventually 
became the Great War...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS37_078)So then the Entelexeia 
fought against the humans 
to help the planet?!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS37_079)But why didn't they tell 
the humans how dangerous 
those blastia were?!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS37_080)Neither side probably 
cared much if the other 
brought itself to ruin.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_081)There's never been any love lost 
between humans and Entelexeia. 
Probably didn't talk much.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_082)There may've been other 
reasons, though.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_083)Still, we don't know what 
this story has ta do with 
our <STR>(JUD), here.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS37_084)Temza fell to the flames of war, 
and the technology of the 
Hermes blastia was believed lost...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS37_085)Wait, you mean there are still 
Hermes models in operation?!

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS37_086)Yes. At Ragou's mansion, 
Ehmead Hill, Ghasfarost, 
not to mention...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS37_087)The ceres blastia 
on the Fiertia...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS37_088)So then, you've been 
destroying the blastia in 
place of the Entelexeia...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS37_089)You could have 
mentioned that!<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_090)Why didn't you say something?! 
Were you gonna save the world all 
on your own? Are you stupid?!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS37_091)Wh-what was that?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS37_092)Ba'ul!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS37_093)Nan!

## POINTER 26
Tison
<VOICE>(VS37_094)It looks like we've 
found our mark.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS37_095)You will not pass.

## POINTER 28
Nan
<VOICE>(VS37_096)You're a person, aren't you?! 
How can you defend a monster?!

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS37_097)Didn't you get the news? 
I said nobody lays a hand 
on one of our own.

## POINTER 30
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS37_098)W-we won't allow that! 
Not even from you, Nan!

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS37_099)We were having a conversation 
over here! Butt out!

## POINTER 32
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS37_100)I don't usually like ta get 
my clothes dirty, but...

## POINTER 33
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS37_101)Everyone...

## POINTER 34
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS37_102)Have the Hunting 
Blades added people 
to their list of targets?

## POINTER 35
Tison
<VOICE>(VS37_103)Nobody who associates with 
monsters can rightly call 
themselves a person.

## POINTER 36
Nan
<VOICE>(VS37_104)<STR>(KAR). Have you forgotten 
the credo of the Hunting 
Blades? Step aside.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS37_105)Monsters are evil... And the 
Hunting Blades pursue that evil.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_106)But the Entelexeia aren't 
evil! They were fighting 
to save the world...

## POINTER 38
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS37_107)Don't let them fool you with that 
credo nonsense. They're on a job. 
They're here for the apatheia.

## POINTER 39
Tison
<VOICE>(VS37_108)Humph. It seems you won't listen to reason.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS37_109)If you have no intention 
of moving...

## POINTER 40
Nan
<VOICE>(VS37_110)You leave us no choice.

## POINTER 41
Information
<STR>(JUD) is not in your party.
Please form a party with <STR>(JUD) as a member.

## POINTER 42
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS37_111)Nan...I'm sorry.
