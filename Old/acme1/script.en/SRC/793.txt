Hello, fine visitors, and welcome to 
the Yumanju Hot Spring Spa!<PAGE>Ah, so you're back! I'm glad you enjoyed 
our hot springs so much the last time.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
We didn't enjoy them at all! What 
the hell was with that partition? 
You can see right through it!

## POINTER 2

No, no, we simply folded up 
the partitions to open up the 
space as much as possible.<PAGE>Besides, it's a question of morals. I doubt any visitor 
to our springs would be of such despicable moral fiber 
as to spy on members of the opposite gender!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Hey, hey, I didn't get 
to see anything!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
You certainly would've, 
given half the chance.

## POINTER 5

If it's that much of a concern for 
you, perhaps you'd like to rent 
out a spring for personal use?<PAGE>You would be the only ones using your particular 
spring, so you could all go into the same bath 
with no problems, males and females together.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
T-t-t-together?!<PAGE>This is an excellent idea! Let's 
do this! We should do this.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Hey old man, if you want us to all 
go in together, it's just going 
to be you and <STR>(KAR) in there.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Whaaat? Alone in there with 
<STR>(RAV)? No, I think even 
I'll pass on that one.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
Well, what if we rented 
out a spring and went in 
one gender at a time?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
One gender at a time, eh... 
If that works for you girls, 
it sounds good to me.

## POINTER 11

All right then! Now then, 
exclusive hot spring rental 
will be 600,000 Gald.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
S-six hundred thousand Gald?!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
That's twice as much as 
it was last time...

## POINTER 14

Since you're reserving the room for just 
yourselves, the price is a bit higher...<PAGE>But it's really quite a bargain!

## POINTER 15
Pay the fee for the spa?
Yes
No

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
The girls deserve to have 
a good time, too...<PAGE>Here you go.

## POINTER 17

## POINTER 19

Please come again.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
We'll come back once we've 
saved up enough Gald.

## POINTER 21
