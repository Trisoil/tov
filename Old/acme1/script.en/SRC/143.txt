...So <STR>(FRE) wasn't 
in there, either.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
So who is this knight, exactly?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
He's <STR>(YUR)'s friend.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Hmmm, "your" friend? 
That must be a pain.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Huh?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Never mind. So 
what brings him 
to this town?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
He was looking for a mage to repair 
Halure's barrier blastia...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
Ohh...that rookie... He 
came to see me, too.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(FRE) did? Was he all right?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
Yeah, I guess.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
You guess?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
Since he's a knight, I'm sure he got 
some mage or another to help. Maybe 
he's already back in Halure?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
...Oh, no...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Well? Do you trust me yet?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
I don't think <STR>(RIT)'s the 
sort of person to steal.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Vouch for her character all you like, 
but that doesn't prove her innocence.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
But...!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RIT)
Don't bother trying to make him believe
me. But, I really didn't do it, y'know.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Hmph. Well, I guess research seems 
to fit you better than robbery.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(YUR) isn't very good at expressing his feelings.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
...What a weirdo.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RIT)
I'm going to go let the city guards
know about what happened. 
Go and wait for me in my lab.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
I don't think those stubborn 
guards will let us pass through 
the entrance.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
True. Then take 
this with you.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
Show this to the guard and 
they should let you through.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
Thanks.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
Got it? Don't leave town 
without my permission 
or you'll be sorry!
