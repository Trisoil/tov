*Yawn* I slept so nicely.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
I tried shaking you and calling your
name, but you wouldn't wake up.
I thought you were gone, <STR>(RIT).<PAGE>...*Sigh*...
What a relief!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
We must've been more tired 
than we thought.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
...Are those two still at it?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. They've been fighting 
with hardly a moment's rest 
ever since they started.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
They look like they're 
enjoying themselves.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
They've got some nerve. 
When are we going to leave? 
It's stiflingã€€here.<PAGE>I'm going to go do some maintenance 
on the Vesperia One or something.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
Oh, I'll help!

<STR>(JUD)

similar, really...
