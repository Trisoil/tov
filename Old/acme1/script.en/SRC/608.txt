Hey, look over there!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Nobis?! That guy 
is Dyne's client?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
He's the one with the Soul Smiths, right?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
We should probably help him 
out before he becomes lunch.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Here we go!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Yo, hang in there.

## POINTER 6
Nobis
My...my Everlight. 
Is it safe...?

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
You're kidding. You mean you 
haven't given that up yet?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
Some people never learn.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
No matter how important it might be 
to you, you'd have to be crazy to face 
a monster like this on your own.<PAGE>This isn't something worth throwing 
your life away for!

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Come on <STR>(EST_P), cut 
him a little slack.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
But he was hurt as it was, 
already, and he came 
here despite that...

## POINTER 12
Nobis
Please...forgive me...

## POINTER 13
Nobis
But I must...take 
this back with 
me... Aah...!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
Nobis, hang on!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Let's get him back 
to Mantaic so 
he can rest.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Wait, we need some evidence that we beat 
the monster... It's all about evidence...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
Here, this oughta do.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
Nobis may not make it if we don't 
hurry. Are we finished here?
