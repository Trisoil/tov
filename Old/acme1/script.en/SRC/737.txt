You think we might be able to look 
for a certain book? I want to find 
out some more about hermes blastia.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
So we should just look for the right bookshelf?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Yes, please.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
...Found it!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, it's Ifmunft Nepmayjup's 
"Discourses on Aer!"

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
What? You've heard of 
this book before?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
This book used to be in my house. I think it may've 
belonged to the person who lived there before me.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
...I see... Yes, I see...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
It was all full of codes that I couldn't understand, 
so I didn't find it all that interesting.<PAGE>I ended up giving it to the first person 
who showed any interest in it.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
Ifmunft Nepmayjup. 
That's Hermes. It 
was his penname.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
What?! Really?!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
...So that means 
Hermes used to 
live in Aspio?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
That's what it would mean, yes.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RIT)
Keeping something important like 
that from us yet again...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
I'm sorry. I wasn't entirely 
sure of it until now.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
*Sigh* ...Well, whatever.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
What...is all this? I can't understand 
any of it at all...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
"Kdvkxosktzgr hrgyzog 
iuarj hk jgtmkxuay..."<PAGE>It looks like he just wrote letters at random...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
It's all in code. I thought 
about trying to figure it 
out a few times, but...<PAGE>This annoying type of writing is often 
used for taking down personal memos and 
the like. But not for research papers.<PAGE>And look at the front of the book.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
It says, "I dedicate 
this to my daughter."

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
And then it says "Try and 
read it." ...Pretty ambiguous, 
don't you think?<PAGE>I never felt up to 
trying to read it.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
...Do you think this could've 
been his way of giving a challenge 
to his daughter...?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(JUD)
Yes, I think it was.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
I see... What a ridiculous, 
foolish researcher.<PAGE>He didn't even know what 
the blastia he'd created 
were capable of.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
Yeah...

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
That's it... I'm going 
to take this book 
and decode it!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(EST_P)
Wait... C-can you 
really do that...?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(JUD)
No, I think that's best. We went to all 
the trouble of finding it, after all.

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
I...I guess so...

## POINTER 29
<STR>(RIT)
Right. I'll show that blastia-researching 
bozo!
