Ah, there you are, boy.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
You sure have your own way 
of doing things, old man.<PAGE>Then again, I guess that's your only redeeming quality.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
Hey, way to hurt a man's feelings! I've 
got a ton of redeemin' qualities!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
That's one list you can 
just keep to yourself.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
I hafta tell ya, I was so surprised to 
find out that Belius was that beast--sorry, 
I mean, Entelexeia, was it?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah. But it seems like the 
story about her engineering 
the Great War was a lie.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
Prolly just an excuse the empire made 
up for them to invade Nordopolica.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Maybe, yeah.<PAGE>So, is that the Don's 
grandson? How'd he end 
up here, anyway?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
This idiot got fed false information 
by Leviathan's Claw and acted 
without thinking.

## POINTER 9

I heard that an ally of the Don's 
had been captured by a monster, and 
I thought I'd come to save him.<PAGE>And then I heard that the monster 
possessed apatheia, so...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
They said that Belius 
had been captured?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
Apparently that's what Leviathan's Claw 
said. So they went down there with the 
Hunting Blades to kill the monster.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
And that monster was actually Belius, so even 
though you got the apatheia, the ally you 
were supposed to save ended up dying.

## POINTER 13
Harry
Yeah...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
You need ta learn ta take things slower. 
Check your information before you rush 
out all ready for battle...

## POINTER 15
Harry
Damn it, what 
the hell do 
you know!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
...Things like this happen, I guess...<PAGE>Having the Don for a grandfather puts 
a lot of pressure on the boy.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
Anyone with a grandfather like that would 
be expected to work their butt off, yeah.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RAV)
Everyone expects too much of him. So 
he works hard not to let anyone down, 
and then things like this happen...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
...Palestralle's not going to 
be too happy about this.<PAGE>Even if he didn't have any choice but to fight, 
I doubt they'll take that for an excuse.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RAV)
That Natz guy should 
forgive us, I think.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
That would be nice. But Natz isn't 
the Duce. It's the others in the 
guild we have to worry about.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RAV)
Well, I don't know how 
to get out this mess!<PAGE>For now I'm going to take 
him to see the Don.<PAGE>Take the ship to Dahngrest as soon 
as it's workin' again, would ya?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Gotcha.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RAV)
I actually do know how to 
get out of this, but...<PAGE>An eye for an eye... It's a matter 
between guilds, after all...
