Princess! You 
look well.<PAGE>You've grown into a 
strong young woman.<PAGE>I'm sure you've seen many amazing 
things so far in your journey.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, I have! Master, I have 
so much to tell you!<PAGE>Recently, I saw the sea! 
It was so amazing!<PAGE>I'd heard about it in stories, but it 
was even bigger than I thought...<PAGE>But that's not all! We took a ship onto 
the sea, and there was water in every 
direction, no matter where we looked...<PAGE>And then, we went into a nightmarish desert, with 
nothing but sand for as far as the eye could see! 
The sunshine was so hot, it was unreal...<PAGE>And then there was a dreamlike city 
floating in the sky, and then...

for you, weren't they?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes! I'm ashamed of how little I knew 
of the world outside the castle...

You still have much left to see. 
Don't let your journey end yet.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, I'd like to see and learn about 
many, many more things in the world, 
as a member of the imperial family.

Drake
Long ago, the Emperor's brother organized the 
Regin Expeditionary Force to explore the 
world and maintain peace in the empire...<PAGE>Seeing you now, it is as if 
I'm looking into the eyes of 
His Highness Regin himself.

To make sure that you follow the
