Hey, it's <STR>(YUR)! Wait 
there, would ya?

## POINTER 1
Hanks
<STR>(YUR), I've been waiting for 
you and <STR>(FRE) to show up.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
You were waiting for me and...<STR>(FRE)?

## POINTER 3
Hanks
Yep. I wanted to give this to you.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
Hmmm...that's quite the item. You can't find 
anythin' like that in a store. How'd somethin' 
like that end up in the lower quarter?

## POINTER 5
Hanks
This sword belonged to a famous mercenary who visited 
us in the lower quarter a long time ago.<PAGE>He only came through here by chance, 
but he ended up liking it so much 
that he stayed for a long time.<PAGE>Actually, it would be better 
to say he lived here. We came 
to think of him as one of us.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
That's the first time I've heard
anything about someone like that.

## POINTER 7
Hanks
It makes sense that you wouldn't know about 
him. He left the capital and went on his way 
a long time before you were even born.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Where did the mercenary go after he left?

## POINTER 9
Hanks
I don't know...a bunch of knights and guild 
members came to ask if he'd left his sword 
behind, but we were never able to find it.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
What do you mean? How could a mercenary 
go off without his sword?

## POINTER 11
Ted
But then, just a while back, when we were 
cleaning up the city after things in the 
capital got crazy, the sword turned up.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
...How could that be?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Maybe it was a gift to the people in the 
lower quarter in return for your hospitality.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
Then why didn't he just 
give it to them himself?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RAV)
He probably planned 
on comin' back an' getting' 
it someday.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Then if that's the case, 
we shouldn't be taking 
it with us, right?

## POINTER 17
Hanks
The mercenary always said 
that swords should be 
used to protect people.<PAGE>I don't think he'd mind if I left the 
sword with our lower quarter boys, who 
are working to protect the world.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
A weapon chooses its owner,
not the other way around...<PAGE>It might not just be random chance that the 
sword turned up now, after all those years.

## POINTER 19
Hanks
Use the sword, <STR>(YUR). 
You'd be doing all 
of us a favor.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
All right. I'll hold 
onto it for you.

## POINTER 21
Ted
Don't forget to split it with <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 22
<STR>(EST_P)
That sword holds everyone's 
hopes and dreams, doesn't it?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah. It's heavier 
than it looks.
