Hey, did you find anything out?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
She said it was twenty years ago on Mt. Temza...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Twenty years ago? Huh? What was?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
That area's been a wasteland 
ever since the Great War.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
But rocks are rocks. Wars shouldn't
really affect things like that.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(JUD), weren't you born 
there? Did you ever hear 
anything about this?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
Well, I was really little when 
I lived there. I never heard
anyone talking about Everlight.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Hmm... Okay....

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Wouldn't it be faster 
just to go and see if we 
can get any ourselves?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, you're right. Let's 
take a trip to Mt. Temza.
