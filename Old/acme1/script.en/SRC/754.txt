Try to be careful. These botanical 
abnormalities are being 
caused by the aer here. <PAGE>There's a good chance that there are pockets 
of excess aer all over the place.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
Yeah, too much aer can 
have negative effects 
on people and blastia.<PAGE>Takin' in a lotta aer causes yer 
metabolism ta speed up, and that'll 
make ya more tired than usual.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Wow, you know more than I thought.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Eh? That's just common sense!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
I'd expect people to know about 
aer's effect on the human body...<PAGE>But I didn't think it was common knowledge 
that blastia can become supersaturated 
with aer if used improperly.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Nah, anyone who deals with bodhi 
blastia should know all about it!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(KAR)
Actually, I'd never heard about 
it until <STR>(RIT) mentioned it.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Ya gotta quit slackin' and hit the books, kid!
