Ah, <STR>(RAV). Just the man 
I was looking for.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
Oops, looks like I walked inta the 
wrong building by accident. See ya.

## POINTER 2

Wait! Just hear 
me out.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
We've already got our hands pretty full 
with other people's troubles, ya know.

## POINTER 4

Harry isn't in any sort of state 
to help us with this...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Okay, okay. I'll hear what ya 
got ta say. But that's all!

## POINTER 6

Yes, sir!<PAGE>Recently, we've had countless 
skirmishes breaking out between 
the guilds and the empire.<PAGE>In the past, the Union has always 
mediated these disputes.<PAGE>But now that the Don has 
passed away, the Union is only 
a shell of what it once was.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
The Union's not workin' like it use 
ta, so that's why yer comin' by 
yerself ta talk with me about this?

## POINTER 8

Yes. I hear that Fortune's Market and the 
Knights also clashed the other day over 
the sealing off of the Weasand of Cados.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
That would be <STR>(FRE)'s 
blockade, I think.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah, probably so.

## POINTER 11

And because of the law of no intervention 
between guilds, Altosk can't directly admonish 
Fortune's Market for what they did.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
Restorin' the Union ta its former self 
may be the only choice we've got...

## POINTER 13

But Harry's in no condition to help, and 
we still need to do something about the 
next head of the Blood Alliance...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
We've gotta take things one at a time. 
First off is yer guild, Altosk. Do 
somethin' to fix that boy Harry up.<PAGE>And if I run inta Madam President, 
I'll see if I can't convince her ta 
do things right, through the Union.

## POINTER 15

I understand. Thank 
you for your help.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Miss Kaufman, eh? But I wonder 
where we can find her...

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
Don't ya worry about that. We don't hafta 
search fer her or anything. We'll just 
let her know if we happen ta see her.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
But...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
You think that Altosk will be 
able to knock the Union back into 
shape, don't you old man?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RAV)
They learn quick and act fast. 
They're the only thing keepin' the 
Union in check, if ya ask me.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
Ahh, right.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RAV)
So if we happen ta see that pretty 
president anytime soon, let's 
be sure ta ask fer her help.
