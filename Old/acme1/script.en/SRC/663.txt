Ah, so you've returned.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Hey, good to see you again.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Elder, why is the mural 
hidden like this?<PAGE>Isn't this the lore of our 
ancestors? Isn't it important 
for everyone to know?

## POINTER 3

...We gave up blastia as a race so that we might 
not repeat the mistakes of our ancestors. <PAGE>And then this mural was left behind, so 
that the dire consequences of these mistakes 
might be known to later generations.<PAGE>However, fearing that this knowledge would 
bring confusion to our brethren, our ancestors 
hid the mural within this wall.<PAGE>Those who handed down the lore of the Kritya were 
the only ones entrusted with this truth...

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Really...?

## POINTER 5

Yes...but now that I think about it, perhaps 
it was a mistake to keep it a secret.<PAGE>We should have told everyone of these events 
earlier, and worked together to find 
a way to fight against the Adephagos.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
...But... It's 
not too late!

## POINTER 7

Thank you, thank you, 
Miss Earth-Dweller.

## POINTER 8

Hello! Is everyone 
else coming...?<PAGE>Ah...what's that painting doing here?

## POINTER 9

Oh...well, you see, this was...passed 
down from our ancestors...

## POINTER 10

Hellooo, I hope I'm 
not late... Wait, 
what is that...?

## POINTER 11

This is that thing that's floating up in the 
sky out there. Look, everyone's fighting it!

## POINTER 12

The Krityans are holding spears, too!

## POINTER 13

Wooow, cool!

## POINTER 14

Indeed it is, little one.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
...Is this really okay? I thought 
he didn't want them to know...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
Maybe it's not such a big deal. Look, 
no one seems to be too disturbed by it.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
I guess...

## POINTER 18

How could you keep something as 
cool as this all for yourself, 
Mr. Elder? That's not fair!

## POINTER 19

Sorry, little one, but my grandfather 
told me to take good care of it.<PAGE>It was too much trouble to 
leave it out, so I hid it.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(JUD)
Ah, I thought 
as much.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
But what about my encouraging words...

## POINTER 22

The Krityans fought against 
the monster, too!

## POINTER 23

And then they wiped it out!

## POINTER 24

We need to be brave, too...!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(JUD)
I understand their hesitation. This 
is what being a Krityan is all about.<PAGE>I wasn't able to be like the rest 
of my people. That's why I left 
this city in the first place.

## POINTER 26

All right, let's have our meeting! We need to discuss 
what measures we can take against the monster!

## POINTER 27

Well then, if you'll 
excuse us...

## POINTER 28
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, right, we'll be going now.
