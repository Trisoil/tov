Ah, <STR>(YUR). Have you found 
any clues as to my brother's 
whereabouts?

No, nothing yet.

I see...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
It's pretty hard to look for 
him when all we have is 
the name, "Clay", to go by.

Well then, please go and 
meet Lune. She's my 
brother's girlfriend.<PAGE>You should be able to find 
her with the children in 
the citizens' quarter.

<STR>(EST_P)
Okay, let's go and have a look.
