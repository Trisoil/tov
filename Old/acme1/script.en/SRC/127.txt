May I see your passport, please?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
Our...passport?

## POINTER 2

This is an Imperial facility. 
We can't just let anyone 
inside, can we?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
Passport? You don't have one of those, do you?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
An associate of ours is inside. 
Could you please let us through?

## POINTER 5

If you filled out the official visitation paperwork, 
then you ought to have gotten your passport 
from this "associate" of yours.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
This is the first we've heard, though.<PAGE>If you won't let us in, perhaps you 
could call him to the gate for us?

## POINTER 7

What's your associate's name?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Mordio.

## POINTER 9

M-Mordio?!

## POINTER 10

W-we can't help you. You'll need 
to mail in a request and have a passport 
officially issued to you.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
Damn, don't budge an inch, do you?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
Excuse me, but did a knight by the name 
of <STR>(FRE) happen to stop by here?

## POINTER 13

All information about the establishment is classified. 
We cannot share even small details with outsiders.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(EST_P)
So you can't even tell me why <STR>(FRE) was here?

## POINTER 15

No, of course not.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(EST_P)
...So what you're saying...is that 
<STR>(FRE) really did come here!

## POINTER 17

I-I don't know who you're talking about! A 
knight named <STR>(FRE)? N-never heard of him!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
Could we at least 
leave him a message?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Give it up, <STR>(EST_P). We'd 
have more luck asking a 
brick wall for help.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
Let's just go.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
But <STR>(FRE)'s inside...

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
What, we're just going to give up?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm not going to give up! 
I'm going to see <STR>(FRE)!

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
And I'm going to take back that blastia 
from that thief Mordio, and give him 
a beating he won't forget.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(KAR)
So can't we look for 
another way in?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
Of course we can. Let's take a 
stroll around, why don't we?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
As a last resort, maybe we 
could go over the walls.
