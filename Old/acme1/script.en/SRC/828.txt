Oh? Kaufman? I 
didn't expect to 
see you again.

## POINTER 1
Kaufman
I've just been talking 
shop a little. No concern 
of yours, though.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
Always the businesswoman, 
eh? Always tryin' 
ta cut a deal!

## POINTER 3
Kaufman
Are you trying to charm 
me? It's having the 
opposite effect.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
That's the old man's 
MO, I'm afraid.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
So do you want to make other amusement 
parks like this one in the world? There 
could be an untapped market out there.

## POINTER 6
Kaufman
Now here's a girl with a good 
head on her shoulders.<PAGE>This place isn't business-oriented like other 
amusement parks, so the park itself doesn't 
really produce any profit. However...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Ahh, so yer plannin' on providin' 
transportation here and turnin' 
a profit that way?

## POINTER 8
Kaufman
Exactly. We were just 
discussing how to divide 
the shares, but...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RIT)
So what's the matter? Are 
they unhappy that their 
shares are too small?

## POINTER 10
Kaufman
Quite the opposite, actually. 
They say they don't 
want any Gald at all.

## POINTER 11

We have no need of Gald! It's 
enough for us if we can 
just make others happy.<PAGE>That's all it takes for 
us to be satisfied.

## POINTER 12
Kaufman
You see? How am I supposed 
to work a deal with people 
who think like that?

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
What's the problem? They say they 
don't want any Gald... Sounds like 
a pretty sweet deal for you.

## POINTER 14
Kaufman
No! It would go against our guild's 
principles. Good people must 
always be dealt with fairly!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
Hmm... You kind of 
remind me of Leblanc, 
Miss Kaufman.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
That annoying old fart? 
Are you serious?

## POINTER 17
Kaufman
Did you just say "Leblanc?"

## POINTER 18
<STR>(EST_P)
Y-yes, I did, 
but...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Has he been bothering 
you, too?

## POINTER 20
Kaufman
No...no, don't worry 
about it. It's 
nothing really.

## POINTER 21

Hey hey, do you 
mind if I go?<PAGE>I've gotta go 
make some Milk 
Yakisoba!<PAGE>See ya!

## POINTER 22
Kaufman
W-wait a 
second...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(EST_P)
Did you notice that? When 
she heard Leblanc's name...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(YUR)
Yeah... I wonder what 
that was about.
