Hmph...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
W-wait! I, I want 
to talk to Nan...

<STR>(KAR)...

## POINTER 4

...Nan, what about you? 
Do you have anything 
to say to this kid?

## POINTER 5
Nan
M-master... 
I...

## POINTER 6
Clint
......<PAGE>We're heading to Dahngrest. 
Make sure you're back 
by tomorrow morning.

## POINTER 7
Nan
Chief...thank you.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
......

## POINTER 9
Nan
...So, what is it, <STR>(KAR)?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(KAR)
Well... There's something 
I wanted to talk to 
you about, Nan.<PAGE>I'm sorry for always being so wishy-washy...and 
for causing you nothing but trouble.<PAGE>But during my travels with <STR>(YUR) and 
everyone else, I've figured out 
what's really important to me.<PAGE>That's why...

## POINTER 11
Nan
Can you just stop bothering me? ...You 
only ever think about yourself, <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 12
<STR>(KAR)
Nan...

## POINTER 13
Nan
Even if you've learned what's important 
to you, nothing's ever going to change 
if you stay as weak as you are.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
I'll get stronger. I'll 
prove myself to you, Nan.

## POINTER 15
Nan
I wonder... You've always 
talked big. But nothing 
ever comes of it.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
It, it might be impossible...but 
I want you to believe me. I'm 
different, Nan. I've changed.

## POINTER 17
Nan
...All right. I'll 
teach you a technique 
of mine.<PAGE>If you can master it in one night, I'll 
reconsider how I feel about you.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
In, in one night...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Sounds like we'll be spending the night here!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
Thanks, <STR>(YUR)...
