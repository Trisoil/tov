Something I can help you two with?

## POINTER 5
Adecor
Even if you have a direct pardon from His Highness

As members of the Imperial 
Knights, our honor will not 
allow us to simply let that slide!

battle with us here, I 
say, fair and square!

you as innocent of your crimes!

## POINTER 9

Don't make claims you can't back up.<PAGE>Since when did you two have

Man... Nothing like some 
good exercise before 
turning in for the night.<PAGE>I guess I'll hurry back to the inn...
