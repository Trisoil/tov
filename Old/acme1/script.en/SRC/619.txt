Hey! Look, over there!

## POINTER 1
Sebastian
S-s-somebody, help me...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Sebastian... So 
this is where you've 
been hiding.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Good grief. Nothing's ever easy, is it?

## POINTER 4
Sebastian
Y-you saved my life...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
So, where'd you stash 
all the stuff you 
ran off with?

## POINTER 6
Sebastian
I-I don't know what you're talking about...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
We're talking about the items you stole 
from your mistress, of course.

## POINTER 8
Sebastian
Omigosh, stop...!<PAGE>I'll talk, I'll talk!<PAGE>I was just on my way to get them. 
I've tucked them away where 
nobody would bother looking.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(EST_P)
A place no one 
would look...?

## POINTER 10
Sebastian
I put them smack dab in the middle 
of the ruins of an old town 
on the Tolbyccian continent.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
I wonder if he means Caer Bocram.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
...That's gotta be it. I don't suppose there was 
a secret manual with the rest of the stuff.

## POINTER 13
Sebastian
Secret manual...? You mean 
that stone tablet engraved 
with the ancient writing?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
A stone...tablet...?

## POINTER 15
Sebastian
There was a black stone tablet with a 
bunch of stuff written on it in red, but 
it wasn't anything I could read...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
Are you sure that was all?

## POINTER 17
Sebastian
That's all I can think of... 
The rest was just money 
and a few paintings...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Then that just might be the 
secret manual after all.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
I had thought a manual would be 
something more like a book.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
Hey...! 
Wait...!<PAGE>A-aren't we going after him?!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
We're not under any obligation 
to bring him in.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RAV)
We got the info we needed, so I'd 
say we're still par for the course.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(JUD)
I suppose he isn't our concern, then.<PAGE>At any rate, he's bound to have 
a tough time of it, running off 
on his own in a place like this.

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
Heh, maybe you're right. I guess he'll 
just be getting what he deserves.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
So our next stop 
should be Caer 
Bocram, then.

## POINTER 26
<STR>(EST_P)
With any luck we'll finally 
get a hold of the manual.

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah.
