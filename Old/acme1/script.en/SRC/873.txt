Hyeah!
Hyeah...!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Hmm, that's a pretty
ancient-looking sword.

## POINTER 2
Rich
...Hmpf...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
The blade's gotten really dull, too...

## POINTER 4
Rich
...It's no longer anything more than an 
antique, unfit to cut man or beast...

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Is that sword important 
to you?

## POINTER 6
Rich
...It belonged to someone I respect. 
I can't just get rid of it...

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
Rich...It seems like you're not 
running a traveling inn just for 
the heck of it. Am I right?

## POINTER 8
Rich
...Hmpf...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
...You shouldn't be so nosy, <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 10
Rich
It's all right...<PAGE>...I'm...
I'm a warrior, not an 
innkeeper...<PAGE>...I left my village with Karen 
to slay Giganto Monsters...
I was 15 at the time...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
When you were 15? How 
old are you now?

## POINTER 12
Rich
...I'm 28...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Thirteen years, huh...
That's pretty longâ€¦

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
The Giganto Monster... That's the 
name of a giant type of monster 
living all over the world.<PAGE>I heard that an extermination 
force sent by the empire to kill 
them was entirely wiped out.

## POINTER 15
Rich
Until every single one of those 
monsters has fallen, I cannot 
go back to my hometown...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Why's that...?

## POINTER 17
Rich
......

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
Sounds like there's something 
you're not telling us.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
...Maybe we can help?<PAGE>It seems like you're having 
a tough time of it.

## POINTER 20
Rich
...But you see...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
I don't know the details, 
but you committed to doing 
this yourself, didn't you?

## POINTER 22
Rich
...Y-yeah...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Then it sounds like this 
it up to him, <STR>(KAR).

## POINTER 24
<STR>(KAR)
Y-yeah...

## POINTER 25
Rich
......

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
Thanks for letting 
us stay the night.

## POINTER 27
Rich
No problem...

## POINTER 28
Karen
Come again!

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
Maybe we should have 
helped them...

## POINTER 30
<STR>(YUR)
We can't solve all of the world's 
problems by ourselves.<PAGE>Though if we ever happen to run into those 
monsters that he was talking about...we 
might as well take them out for him.<PAGE>I don't see any problem with doing that much.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(KAR)
Yeah. All right.
