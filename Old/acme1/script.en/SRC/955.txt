What sort of blastia is this...?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, get your grubby mitts off it!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Of course...
It's slightly different 
from the norm, but it looks 
like a type of warp blastia.<PAGE>Its activating mechanism is... 
Let's see...
Huh...?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
What's the matter?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
...There's no activation 
switch!<PAGE>It's properly equipped with a core, and it 
doesn't look like it's the type where you 
can activate it by removing the core.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
So maybe there's an activation 
switch located somewhere else?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Perhaps... If there were 
another blastia like this 
one in this town.<PAGE>It wouldn't be too unusual for there to be 
some device to manage all of them at once.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, so we can't 
activate it, then? 
Too bad...

## POINTER 8
<STR>(KAR)
Huh? Why's it too bad?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, I just had a hunch it would 
lead to something interesting...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Blastia isn't a toy, you know!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
Couldn't we just look for the 
device that's managing it?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
Yes...

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
Sure, maybe we can find it...

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
I've told you. There's no 
switch. We can't use this.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Look, it's not like I'm crying or anything!

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Oh, it's working!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
So that was the activation 
device, after all!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
Then hurry up and--

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RIT)
Hold your horses.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
This is just like in the Shaikos 
Ruins. If you don't fill up the 
core with aer, it won't work.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
Ah, so I should use the Sorcerer's Ring.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RIT)
Right.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
What sort of blastia is this...?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(RIT)
Get your grubby mitts off it! I don't 
want to have to tell you again!

## POINTER 25
<STR>(RIT)
Of course...
It's slightly different 
from the norm, but it looks 
like a type of warp blastia.<PAGE>But...there's no activation 
switch...

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
That device we saw back there... That 
was the activation device for this!

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
You mean in order to use 
this to warp, we need to 
activate that device?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
Then we need 
to go back there, 
right?

## POINTER 29
<STR>(KAR)
What sort of blastia is this...?

## POINTER 30
<STR>(RIT)
Hey, get your grubby mitts off it!

## POINTER 31
<STR>(RIT)
Of course...
It's slightly different 
from the norm, but it looks 
like a type of warp blastia.

## POINTER 32
<STR>(EST_P)
A warp blastia? You mean it 
moves people around...?

## POINTER 33
<STR>(RIT)
Most likely, it'll automatically 
take us to some place far away.<PAGE>It's working...
In a bunch 
of ruins like this...?

## POINTER 34
<STR>(RIT)
That device we saw back there... That 
was the activation device for this!

## POINTER 35
<STR>(YUR)
...Ah, okay.

## POINTER 36
<STR>(RIT)
For the activation to be managed remotely like 
that... That might mean that there are other, 
similar types of blastia placed around.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(KAR)
Then hurry up and--

## POINTER 38
<STR>(RIT)
Hold your horses.

## POINTER 39
<STR>(RIT)
This is just like in the Shaikos 
Ruins. If you don't fill up the 
core with aer, it won't work.

## POINTER 40
<STR>(YUR)
Ah, so I should use the Sorcerer's Ring.

## POINTER 41
<STR>(RIT)
Right.
