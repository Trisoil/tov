How about them apples?!

## POINTER 1

What? I lost? 
This cannot 
be...!<PAGE>It seems you're no normal player. 
I've been beaten. I admit defeat.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
Wow, not bad, <STR>(RIT)! It looks like 
you're not all talk, after all.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
Heh. You should show 
some respect!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Too bad you didn't do that well 
the first time you tried.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RIT)
Sh-shut up, <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 6

No, winning against me in two 
tries is still quite an impressive 
feat for a young girl.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
See?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
H-how about that?!

## POINTER 9

Ho ho! I lost. You're 
pretty good!

## POINTER 10

You know what they say! 
Third time's a charm!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
Sh-shut up, <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
......
...Finally.

## POINTER 13

Hmpf, yes... I've lost.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
I guess even someone with no 
skill can win eventually.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
Sh-shut up, <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 16

Now, for your prize, 
a delicious kiss from 
yours truly...

## POINTER 17

...Haha, fooled you! No, 
I'm going to give you the 
title of New Master!

## POINTER 18

As news of my defeat travels, 
new challengers will appear, 
hoping to steal your glory!<PAGE>Stay strong and don't lose, 
<STR>(RIT)! That is, the New 
Stone-Taking Master <STR>(RIT)!<PAGE>To be continued next 
time, in "A New 
Assassin Lurks!"

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
To be continued?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
...That's not likely.

## POINTER 21

Ho ho! Ho ho!<PAGE>Well, if you ever feel like 
it, you're welcome to 
join me in my hobbies.
