...You're pretty strong. 
Can you use an Over 
Limit, by any chance?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Sure, yeah.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
Okay. Then try this...

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Huh? What's this?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
The Limit Duo.<PAGE>Your battle spirit can allow 
you to use even more 
powerful Over Limits.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Oh yeah?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
If your battle spirit is 
the real thing, that is.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
So what else can you 
tell me about these 
strong Over Limits?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
You can produce more power when attacking 
alone, or they say you can share battle 
spirit with something else...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Is that so...
I still don't quite get it...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
Really?<PAGE>Maybe you'll pick it up
as you use them in battle?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
Sounds good to me...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
All right, let's get moving, then.
