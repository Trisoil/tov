...! I can't believe I only 
just remembered that...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
I've got a bad feeling about this.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
Hurry! We have to follow them!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
I understand how you're feeling, 
but please try to calm down.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
What! Aren't you worried?!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
Of course I'm worried. That's why we should 
calm down and think rationally, right?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Oh, right... Yeah. 
I see... I'm sorry.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Got any ideas?

## POINTER 8

Ah, yes. The master of Myorzo 
might have some idea.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
He's an Entelexeia, after 
all. Maybe he felt the flow 
of aer from the blastia.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
Did you hear it? Could you 
tell us where it was?<PAGE>...Just a vague direction...to the 
west, a sea of sand...a town?<PAGE>It's not too clear, but 
a desert town...I think 
it's Yormgen.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(KAR)
That's the town in the Sands of Kogorh, 
where we met Duke before.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Let's head there now.

## POINTER 13

You're leaving, then?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
I am.

## POINTER 15

You don't need to shoulder 
such a burden.<PAGE>Haven't you suffered enough?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(JUD)
Thank you, Elder. But I'm 
not suffering anymore.

## POINTER 17

Hmph.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
Heh. If you went into the outside 
world you might understand, too.
