*Yawn*
Should we head out?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
<STR>(RAP)...?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAP)
Grrrr.... Woof woof woof!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Huh...that's...?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
Oh ho, that's the Mini-Wolf 
we saw back in 
Torim harbor!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAP)
(It's "Little Wolf," old man.)

## POINTER 6

(Right, I'm the Little Wolf!)

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAP)
(Why did you come here?)

## POINTER 8

(You call that 
a greeting?)

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAP)
(After how you've treated me in 
the past, you expect me to run 
up to you and lick your face?)

## POINTER 10

(I see you've already finished 
marking about half of the places 
out there as your territory.)<PAGE>(It looks like I'm going to have 
to pull out all the stops.)

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAP)
(Oh? What are you 
going to do?)

## POINTER 12

(I'm going to go all 
out. No more mercy.)<PAGE>(Just like back in the capital.)

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAP)
(Wait!)

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
Wow... It looks like he's going 
to go after the rest of the cities 
even more fiercely than ever.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
It's okay! <STR>(RAP)'s way too 
good to be beaten by the likes 
of him! Isn't that right?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Aww, you don't have to get all embarrassed!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAV)
...Not that I really care, but...<PAGE>Why do I always have to do 
the Little Wolf's voice...?
