<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA021_001)Just what do they eat 
to get this big?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA021_002)The only thing they eat is aer.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA021_003)Any aer that doesn't become 
an apatheia gets metabolized
and makes them this size.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA021_004)And they can live on just that?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA021_005)Aer contains all the necessary 
ingredients for life.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA021_006)Huh. That's a little trick 
we humans can't do.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA021_007)The Entelexeia have each 
evolved into a particular form 
that best suits their needs.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA021_008)It takes time. Many, many times the length of a human life.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA021_009)So, that's why they keep to themselves, 
even though they're all 
part of the same group.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA021_010)Yes.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA021_011)Humans knowledge can't compare 
to the knowledge the Entelexeia 
accumulate over their lives.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA021_012)But even though they're smarter than 
humans, they don't use magic.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA021_013)The Entelexeia have no need to rely 
on magic to defend themselves.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA021_014)Unlike humans.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA021_015)Okay, but magic can be used for other 
things besides self-defense..

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA021_016)I guess they had no desire for power 
other than to protect themselves.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA021_017)So they had a totally different set of values.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA021_018)That "different set of values" has 
led to the wars between the 
humans and the Entelexeia.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA021_019)...And the two sides had to come 
together somehow to defeat the 
Adephagos in the past...<PAGE><VOICE>(VA021_020)Man, you gotta wonder how 
crazy that must've been.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA021_021)I don't know... Ba'ul's still 
young. He wasn't alive 
during those times...

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA021_022)Even so, he's been around more than 
a hundred years already, right?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA021_023)Heh, yeah... But that 
would only make him around 
20 in human years.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA021_024)...I imagine Phaeroh 
would know about the 
events of that era...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA021_025)I wonder if he'd be willing 
to tell us about it.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA021_026)We won't know until we ask.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA021_027)...Shall we meet with him so you can ask in person?

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA021_028)We will soon enough.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA021_029)We haven't solved any of <STR>(EST_P)'s 
issues, so he'd probably 
just yell at us again.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA021_030)You're right...
