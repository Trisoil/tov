Your doggy saved me!

## POINTER 5

Woof!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(YUR)
<STR>(RAP)'s not the sort of

Thanks, Mr. Dog.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 9

I still wonder...why would 
anyone want to take Pauly?

Woof woof woof!

## POINTER 11

It looks like he was just trying 
to make a quick buck.

## POINTER 12

Ugh... I guess we have to be on our 
guard, even inside the barrier...

## POINTER 13
Teagle
...What do you have there, Pauly?

Pauly
That guy dropped something, 
so I picked it up!

The bandit did?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
It looks like a note on how to teach 
a certain technique to a monster.<PAGE>Not that a dumb monster 
could ever learn to use 
a technique like this.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(RAP)
Woof woof woof!

## POINTER 18
<STR>(YUR)
What? Is this
what you want?

## POINTER 19

Woof!

## POINTER 20

There's nothing
<STR>(RAP) can't use...

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
....Oh, alright,
I'll read it to you.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(RAP)
Woof!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
...That's all there is to it.
You think you got all that?

The doggy got
stronger again!
