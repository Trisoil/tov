Ted
Oh, <STR>(YUR)! Fancy 
seeing you here!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
I could say the same for you. I wouldn't 
have ever expected to see you 
together with a noblewoman.

## POINTER 2
Ted
This is Miss Lune! She comes 
and reads books to the kids 
every now and then.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Ah, so you're Lune.

## POINTER 4
Lune
How did you know my name?

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
Shel told me about you.

## POINTER 6
Lune
Oh, I see. The children have 
told me quite a few things 
about you, too, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
Looks like you're the talk of the capital!

## POINTER 8
Lune
What can I do for you?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
I was wondering if you could tell me how I 
might be able to find your boyfriend, Clay.

## POINTER 10
Lune
You're looking for Clay? 
Shel asked you to 
do this, didn't he?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes. We'll find him 
for you, I promise! 
Just be patient!

## POINTER 12
Lune
...Thank you. But you 
needn't try too hard.<PAGE>I'd be glad if Clay 
came back, but I'm happy 
enough as it is.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(EST_P)
Are you sure?

## POINTER 14
Lune
Yes. Now that I know how nice 
it feels to have someone who's 
always there for me...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
...I see.

## POINTER 16
Lune
But I'm very thankful 
for your kindness!<PAGE>Ah yes, <STR>(YUR), you're a 
swordsman, correct? Perhaps 
you could use this.

## POINTER 17
Lune
This book was my father's. 
He was a famous swordsman 
with the Imperial Knights.<PAGE>He had many disciples, but none 
of them were able to master the 
technique...what do you think?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RAV)
Can ya do it?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Maybe...like this?!

## POINTER 20
Ted
That's our <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
Wow, got it on your first try!

## POINTER 22
Lune
That's amazing. You truly 
have a rare gift with 
the sword, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, it's nothing.

## POINTER 24
Lune
No, it's very impressive for 
you to have succeeded where 
all of his disciples failed.<PAGE>As a show of my gratitude for your 
kindness, you may have this book. 
I hope that it'll be useful to you.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
You really think it's okay 
if we don't look for Clay?

## POINTER 26
<STR>(YUR)
I don't know...Shel seemed pretty 
worried about him. Let's search 
for him a little more.
