Who are you? Travelers, 
perhaps?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(KAR)
Haven't we already met?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
It looks like he's forgotten.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
He didn't forget... It's 
more like...we're back 
in the past now.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
Yes. The town's bustling 
with people now, too.

## POINTER 5
Sordeth
What are you whispering 
about over there?<PAGE>Ah, perhaps you would 
like to hear an interesting 
story?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
I don't have the time 
to listen to any epic 
sagas, gramps.

## POINTER 7
Sordeth
No, it'll be quite short, I assure you.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
All right, then. Lay it on us.

## POINTER 9
Sordeth
Well, a while ago, I was putting 
my library in order, you see.<PAGE>And then, out from the stacks of books...

## POINTER 10
Sordeth
...And this time, a little 
mouse came out...

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RIT)
...I cannot believe this... He's been talking for two hours now...

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
Err...perhaps you 
could get to the point 
of the story?

## POINTER 13
Sordeth
What do you mean? This part is very 
important, and interesting, too!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
Come on, get ta the good stuff!

## POINTER 15
Sordeth
Oh, all right. So, ultimately, 
I found a certain 
book in the stacks.<PAGE>And in this book, the following was written:<PAGE>Deep beneath a steep and winding mountain 
range, on the sixth continent of Yurzorea, 
slumbers a man who transcends time...<PAGE>When the maiden of beauty sets out on a
journey, she will come down to the fourth
dimension, keeping watch over a fiery youth.<PAGE>Receiving the love of heaven, she will descend into 
a human body, and will revolt against the heavens.<PAGE>Eh? Pretty interesting, don't you think?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Is it?

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
What mysterious proclamations...
It's very interesting, indeed.

## POINTER 18
Sordeth
Would you like to read more? I can 
give it to you, if you'd like.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
You don't mind?

## POINTER 20
Sordeth
No, not at all. I've already memorized
the whole book anyway.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(EST_P)
Thank you very much!

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
You sure do like 
books, <STR>(EST_P).
