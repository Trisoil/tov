<STR>(RAV)!

## POINTER 1

Welcome back!

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RAV)
Hey.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
That's a bit different from 
the usual reaction he 
gets, don't you think?

## POINTER 4

Where were you travelling, this time? 
Tell me all about your journey!<PAGE>How would you like some tea? I 
baked a cake yesterday, too. 
You're all invited, of course.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(RAV)
Ya know I don't like 
sweet things, right?

## POINTER 6

Oh, maybe I should have made dinner 
instead of tea and cake.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(JUD)
Everyone's got their 
own tastes, I guess.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Seems that way.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(RAV)
I'm tired, so I think I'll be on my 
way. You have someone else ta 
eat your cake for you, right?

## POINTER 10

I want to feed you, <STR>(RAV)!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(RAV)
Come on, there's no use 
wasting your precious time 
on a bitter old fogey like me.<PAGE>Don'tcha have an up-and-comin' 
young lad ta keep ya company? 
Go and be with him.

## POINTER 12

...You mean Harry?<PAGE>No thank you! He's so 
wimpy and negative all 
the time...I hate it!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(RAV)
Men change for women everyday! 
I'm sure you'd be able ta change 
him inta yer dream guy in no time.<PAGE>Stop just makin' excuses 
and get a move on.

## POINTER 14

I'm not making excuses! 
<STR>(RAV), you're so mean!

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
Wow.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
Hmmm...I don't know what to 
think about <STR>(RAV) anymore.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
I feel sorry for that girl after 
he treated her so harshly...

## POINTER 18
<STR>(JUD)
Really? I think I see <STR>(RAV) 
in a whole new light.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAV)
Oh yeah? Ol' <STR>(RAV)'ll welcome 
ya with open arms, ya sweet 
thing. Just say the word.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(KAR)
I think I've finally realized just 
how much <STR>(RAV) likes girls!
