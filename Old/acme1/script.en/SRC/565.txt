Nobis's, all right.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA011_027)Wow, thanks so much 
for your help!<PAGE><VOICE>(VA011_028)And here is the pay I promised you...

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA011_029)If you ever need anything else, don't 
hesitate to call on Brave Vesperia!â™ª

## POINTER 3
Yu
<VOICE>(VA011_030)Yes, of course...see you later.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VA011_032)A symbol of their friendship... How touching. 
I wonder what kind of book it was.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA011_031)A proof of friendship, huh? 
That's kind of nice. I wonder 
what sort of book it was.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA011_033)It was just a normal book. Looked like 
it had something ta do with economics.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA011_034)Did you look inside, <STR>(RAV)?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA011_035)So what if I did?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA011_036)I mean, it's fine, but...what 
if the client had hidden something 
private in the book?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VA011_037)Oh, it's no big deal. No harm done if 
it didn't get in the way of the job.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA011_038)An economics book, eh...
Doesn't sound too racy.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA011_039)It would've been funny if some 
romance novel was the proof 
of two guys' friendship!

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA011_040)Really...?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA011_041)Anyway, I guess we're 
done with our first 
job with the Union.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA011_042)So this what it's like to work in a guild.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA011_043)Yeah. If we were the Hunting 
Blades, we'd probably get jobs 
to exterminate monsters.<PAGE><VOICE>(VA011_044)Fortune's Market usually does stuff like 
transport products over long distances.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VA011_045)So, Brave Vesperia's in the delivery business, then?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA011_046)Well, we...
Uhhh...

## POINTER 19
<STR>(RAP)
<VOICE>(VA011_047)*Howl*, woof woof!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VA011_048)We can think it over while we try 
out a few different kinds of work.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VA011_049)Yeah, sure!
