So, are you hoping to become 
a healer someday?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(EST_P)
No... But even so...<PAGE>The only thing I've ever been 
good at doing for others is 
healing their wounds...<PAGE>I'd like to learn more about 
what a healer does.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(YUR)
I'd say you've done a lot more for 
us than just heal our wounds.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
Huh?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, forget it.<PAGE>Anyway, I don't think there's anything 
wrong with learning more about healing 
and seeing where it takes you.

Yes.
