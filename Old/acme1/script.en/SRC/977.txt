Huh? It looks like a dead end...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(JUD)
No, it's not. Look! 
There's a ladder.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
But we can't use that to get upstairs.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RAV)
Maybe there's somethin' we could 
do to bring it down, eh?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
We need aer.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
Aer?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
Yes. If this conduction tube 
were supplying aer, the ladder 
might be able to move down.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(KAR)
How do we make that happen?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(RIT)
How about you try to figure out things yourself for once?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(KAR)
Maybe if we used that gear?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RIT)
Correct. But it looks like just moving that one 
gear won't be enough to power the aer flow.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
So you're saying there are other gears we need to move?

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
All right, let's go look for them..

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
You don't know, do you?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RIT)
...You're not going to 
get it until I really 
hit you for once, eh?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(KAR)
Wait, you mean all those other times 
you weren't hitting for real?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(YUR)
Cut it out, you two. Let's 
go and look for some 
way to get up there.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
Maybe if we used that gear?

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
Correct. That was pretty 
quick, coming from you.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(KAR)
Cha-ching! Oh yeah!!

## POINTER 20
<STR>(RIT)
Don't get so full of yourself!

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
All right, wanna go 
move that gear, then?
