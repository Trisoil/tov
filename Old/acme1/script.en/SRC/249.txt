Thanks.

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
For what?

## POINTER 2
<STR>(JUD)
You're staying up to 
keep watch, aren't you?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
Nah, not at all.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(JUD)
You're so evasive.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
You're one to talk.

## POINTER 6
<STR>(JUD)
Huh, weird. I've 
always thought I was 
pretty straightforward.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
Seriously? You haven't 
even given your real 
reason for joining our guild.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(JUD)
I joined because I wanted to.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
That's it?

## POINTER 10
<STR>(JUD)
No.

## POINTER 11
<STR>(JUD)
So long as they don't go against 
the laws of the guild, everyone's 
wishes are respected, right?<PAGE>Don't worry. I said I'd 
uphold the laws, and I will. 
But in my own way.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(YUR)
...All right.<PAGE>Well, I'll get you 
to tell me the real 
reason eventually.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(JUD)
Thanks.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
For keeping watch?

## POINTER 15
<STR>(JUD)
For talking.
