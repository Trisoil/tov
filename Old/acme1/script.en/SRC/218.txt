<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_054)<STR>(YUR)...

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_055)Thought I was being 
quiet, but I guess you 
heard me.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_056)So, you've come to 
have a laugh at me 
in this sorry state?

## POINTER 3
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_057)Yeah, I wanted to see what 
kind of expression being locked 
up put on your face.

## POINTER 4
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_058)It doesn't hurt to be forced to view things 
from behind bars every now and then.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_059)What the hell you think you 
were doing, coming here with 
a letter like that?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_060)That was the red eyes
doing. They attacked
after you left.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_061)You don't screw up like that. 
Was it one of your people?

## POINTER 8
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_062)Even if it was, the responsibility is mine.

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_063)I see.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_064)If the red eyes are involved, then 
Ragou's gotta be behind it all.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_065)But how do you know...?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_066)At the harbor, we saw Ragou 
giving orders to one of 
their assassins.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_067)I hadn't heard about that.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_068)Do you know what they're 
trying to do?

## POINTER 14
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_069)...Most likely they want to 
force a clash between the 
guilds and the Knights.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_070)That'd be bad. You think another 
one of those false letters 
went to the Knights?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_071)Yes, to put them in a fighting mood.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_072)If you know that much, then 
get out there and get the 
real letters back.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_073)I was wondering how 
long it'd take you to get 
rid of that damn lock.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_074)...

## POINTER 20
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_075)You've got to stay here.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_076)What, and be your scapegoat?

## POINTER 22
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_077)You're just itching to get 
rid of me, aren't you?

## POINTER 23
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_078)<STR>(YUR), if I don't 
make it back...

## POINTER 24
<STR>(FRE)
<VOICE>(VS20_079)You'll have to die in my place.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_080)Yeah...

## POINTER 26
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_081)Taking your friend's place in a jail 
cell? You lost your mind, son?

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_082)This coming from an old 
man who gets rid of his 
own guards on purpose.

## POINTER 28
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_083)Humph. I had a special favor 
ta ask that rookie knight.

## POINTER 29
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_084)You mean <STR>(FRE)?

## POINTER 30
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_085)The rats that plan these sorta stunts 
usually like ta enjoy their handiwork 
from somewhere nearby.

## POINTER 31
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_086)If you knew the letter was fake, why'd 
you fire everyone up like that?

## POINTER 32
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_087)If I didn't make a good show of 
things, whoever's behind all this 
wouldn't bother ta come watch.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_088)Besides, we've got a lot of hotheads 
around here who'd never let me hear the 
end of it if I didn't raise hell.

## POINTER 33
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_089)So that's where it stands. Of course 
if our friend the knight doesn't 
show up again, your life is mine.

## POINTER 34
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_090)I know.

## POINTER 35
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_091)Tell me one thing, though. What made you 
want to start a guild in the first place?

## POINTER 36
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_092)I realized I couldn't protect the 
things that were important ta me, 
playin' by the empire's rules.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_093)There have to be some things that 
were easier to protect when you 
were on the other side, though.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_094)Even in the lower quarter where 
I'm from, we still had the barrier 
to protect us.

## POINTER 38
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_095)Sure, but were ya happy with 
just puttin' up with all the 
things ya didn't like?

## POINTER 39
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_096)Well, I...

## POINTER 40
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_097)So if the rules the empire 
sets don't suit ya, you've 
got two choices.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_098)You can do like your friend is, 
and put everything you've got 
into changin' the system.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_099)Or ya can turn yer back on 
the empire, and live by the 
rules ya set fer yerself.

## POINTER 41
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_100)That's pretty clear cut...

## POINTER 42
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_101)...Yep. I think yer gonna have 
ta take responsibility for 
lettin' my prisoner go.

## POINTER 43
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_102)You want me to do something 
besides rotting in this cell?

## POINTER 44
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_103)The sap who's been puttin' 
together this little show's gotta 
be somewhere in this city.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_104)I'd been plannin' on askin' 
yer armor-wearin friend ta 
hunt 'em down for me, but...

## POINTER 45
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_105)So what, you want me to find them?

## POINTER 46
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_106)Your job is ta pay this debt back ta 
me. How ya go about it is up ta you.

## POINTER 47
Don Whitehorse
<VOICE>(VS20_107)That young lady ya brought with 
ya is runnin' all over the place 
helpin' with the injured folks.<PAGE><VOICE>(VS20_108)Yer not the type ta be the 
only one sittin around 
twiddlin' his thumbs, right?

## POINTER 48
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS20_109)...<STR>(EST_P). Huh, that 
sounds like her.
