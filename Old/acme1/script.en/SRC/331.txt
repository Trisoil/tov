## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS30_022)Don't go drinking all of it.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS30_023)Thanks, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 3
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS30_024)Hey...do you think...we 
could take five...?

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS30_025)And you say I'm the one 
always wantin' ta rest.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS30_026)Yeaaaaaaah!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS30_027)Huh? The heat's gone 
and baked his brains!

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS30_028)Water!

## POINTER 8
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS30_029)Oh, <STR>(KAR), be careful. 
You'll hurt yourself 
if you fall!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS30_030)Heh... Looks like he still 
had plenty of energy.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS30_031)Wait up for old <STR>(RAV)!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS30_032)And here I thought 
they couldn't bear to 
go another step.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS30_033)I think I'm in heaven.

## POINTER 13
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS30_034)I thought we were 
really done for.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS30_035)Hey now. Gotta be tougher 
than that if you're gonna 
save the world, kids.

## POINTER 15
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS30_036)Shut up.

## POINTER 16
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS30_037)It'll be dangerous if we just 
keep going like this.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS30_038)If we turn back now, though, 
we'll only disappoint those 
poor children.

## POINTER 18
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS30_039)We've got to keep looking 
as long as we can.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS30_040)If we're lucky, we 
may even find Phaeroh 
along the way.

## POINTER 20
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS30_041)That's right. And with this 
spring, we shouldn't have any 
trouble keeping up the search.

## POINTER 21
<STR>(RAV)
<VOICE>(VS30_042)If you've already eaten the poison, 
you may as well lick the plate.

## POINTER 22
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS30_043)Yeah, you're right. We've come this far.

## POINTER 23
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS30_044)How about your water bottle, 
<STR>(KAR)? Did you fill it up?

## POINTER 24
<STR>(JUD)
<VOICE>(VS30_045)Here, I filled them for 
you. Here's yours, <STR>(RIT).

## POINTER 25
<STR>(KAR)
<VOICE>(VS30_046)Thanks, <STR>(JUD)!

## POINTER 26
<STR>(RIT)
<VOICE>(VS30_047)Th-thanks...

## POINTER 27
<STR>(YUR)
<VOICE>(VS30_048)Everybody else all set?

## POINTER 28
<STR>(EST_P)
<VOICE>(VS30_049)Yes.

## POINTER 29
