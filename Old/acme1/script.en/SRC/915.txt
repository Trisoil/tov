Oh boy, oh boy! You've got something 
very nice there, you do!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
I don't know 
what you're 
referring to.

## POINTER 2

Don't play dumb! I know 
all about you getting the 
"Luxury Toys" series!

## POINTER 3
<STR>(KAR)
These things are 
really popular!

## POINTER 4
<STR>(RIT)
Surely only among 
obsessive collectors, 
right?

## POINTER 5

Lemme 
see!

## POINTER 6
<STR>(EST_P)
No!

## POINTER 7

Ahh, so you don't 
like other people 
to touch them!<PAGE>I get it! You don't want my 
fingerprints on them. It's 
okay! I just want to look.

## POINTER 8

Amazing! So retro! 
So nostalgic! 
Thank you!

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Sure, no problem.

## POINTER 10
<STR>(RAV)
Hey, what've 
ya got here?

## POINTER 11

This is treasure fishing! You 
try to see what sort of treasures 
you can catch on your line!<PAGE>You're guaranteed 
to profit!

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
But...it looks like there 
aren't any treasures...?

## POINTER 13

You're very observant, yes! Actually, 
I'm still getting things set up. There 
aren't any treasures to catch yet!

## POINTER 14
<STR>(JUD)
You're still setting things up, and yet you're open for business?

## POINTER 15

I'm still trying to figure 
out what to do... Do 
you have any ideas?

## POINTER 16
<STR>(RAV)
Ideas, huh. When you're 
in need, who better to 
ask but Brave Vesperia!

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
What? Us? Nothing 
comes to mind, 
though...

## POINTER 18

Are you a guild, 
by any chance?

## POINTER 19
<STR>(EST_P)
Yes, we are. Our guild is 
called Brave Vesperia.

## POINTER 20

Ah, so that's how you've gotten 
all of the dolls! Are you 
traveling around the world?

## POINTER 21
<STR>(JUD)
Yes. We've been going all over the 
place...hence the reason that 
we've made it all the way here.

## POINTER 22

Then you can go and get treasure 
chests across the world 
and show them to me!<PAGE>The more treasure chests you 
get, the better ideas I'll have 
for treasures to put here!

## POINTER 23
<STR>(RIT)
You're not saying we should give 
you what we find, are you?

## POINTER 24

Not at all. All you have to 
do is show me, and that'll be 
enough for me to make it.

## POINTER 25
<STR>(EST_P)
You're quite good at 
making things, then?

## POINTER 26

I get by. So go out in the 
world and open all the treasure 
chests you see! âˆ€
