Howdy, welcome to the store! 
What can I get for you today?

## POINTER 1
<STR>(YUR)
Do you have panacea bottles?

## POINTER 2

Unfortunately we're sold out at the moment.

## POINTER 3
<STR>(EST_P)
But how can that be...?

## POINTER 4

But you know, if I had the right ingredients, 
I'd be able to fix some up for you.

## POINTER 5
<STR>(YUR)
What would you need to make it?

## POINTER 6

I'd need three ingredients: 
"eggbear claw," "nia fruit," 
and "luluria petal."<PAGE>But why do you need a panacea 
bottle so badly?<PAGE>A kid came by the other day asking 
about the same exact thing.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(EST_P)
We want to heal Halure's tree.

## POINTER 8

What's that? I've never heard 
of using a panacea bottle 
on a tree before...

## POINTER 9
<STR>(YUR)
Hmmm, yeah...

## POINTER 10
<STR>(EST_P)
What sort of thing is this 
"nia fruit" you mentioned?

## POINTER 11
<STR>(YUR)
That would be that bitter fruit you said 
was so delicious back in the woods.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(EST_P)
So what's an eggbear, then?

## POINTER 13

Sorry, I can't help you there. Monsters 
are beyond my expertise.<PAGE>If a member of the Hunting Blades were 
here they might be able to tell you. They 
make their living hunting monsters.

## POINTER 14
<STR>(YUR)
So that's why he was 
in the forest...

## POINTER 15
<STR>(EST_P)
What can you tell us 
about the luluria petal?

## POINTER 16

You know the tree in the 
middle of town, right? 
It's a petal from that tree.<PAGE>Normally we use magic resin 
but there isn't any around 
these parts at all.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(EST_P)
But the tree is all withered...

## POINTER 18

I believe the mayor has 
some luluria petals. You 
might try asking him.

## POINTER 19
<STR>(YUR)
Gotcha. We'll come back when we've 
gotten the ingredients together.
