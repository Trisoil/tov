Ladies and gentlemen!
This is the event you've
all been waiting for!<PAGE>The first annual Fortune's 
Banquet exhibition match 
is about to begin!<PAGE>This event is brought to you by His Royal 
Highness Ioder, the Guild Union, and our 
generous co-sponsor, Fortune's Market!

## POINTER 1
<STR>(RAV)
This is a pretty big-time event.

## POINTER 2
<STR>(RIT)
Doesn't that little prince have anything 
more important to be doing?

## POINTER 3

First, I'll explain the rules. The competition 
will be divided into three dishes: an 
appetizer, a main course, and a dessert.<PAGE>Competitors must impress the judges 
with the flavor, arrangement and overall 
composition of their chosen dishes!<PAGE>And now, to present the challengers. 
From the Guilds, a proud member of 
Brave Vesperia, Chef <STR>(YUR) Lowell!

## POINTER 4

And representing the Empire, 
hailing from the Imperial 
Knights, Chef <STR>(FRE) Scifo!

## POINTER 5
<STR>(EST_P)
W-why is <STR>(FRE) here?

## POINTER 6
<STR>(RIT)
This doesn't seem like the 
sort of thing he'd be into.

## POINTER 7
<STR>(RAV)
I'll bet he got suckered in by all that 
stuff 'bout promotin' goodwill 
between the Empire and the Guilds.

## POINTER 8
<STR>(YUR)
Can't get enough of these 
Coliseum battles, can we?

## POINTER 9
<STR>(FRE)
At least this time we won't 
have to pull any punches.

## POINTER 10

And now, without further ado, let 
the first annual Fortune's Banquet 
exhibition match begin!

## POINTER 11
<STR>(EST_P)
I'm glad they got to settle their
differences so peacefully like this.

## POINTER 12
<STR>(RAV)
Yeah, it kinda warms 
this old man's heart...

## POINTER 13

Stop your cooking! We will now 
move on to the tasting and 
judging of the prepared dishes!<PAGE>Three judges from our sponsors and two 
judges chosen from the two competitors' 
teams will evaluate the dishes.<PAGE>And now, the tasting and judging 
will commence! First, our guild 
challenger, Chef <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 14
Leblanc
Mmm... This is...truly delicious. 
It blows the food in the knights' 
dining hall out of the water.

## POINTER 15
Kaufman
It's not bad. I might 
even pay for it.

## POINTER 16
Ioder
A delicate taste with a hint 
of adventure. This might even 
be better than the castle 
chef's cooking. Fantastic.

## POINTER 17
<STR>(KAR)
Yummy, yummy, in my tummy! â™ª 
I love your cooking, <STR>(YUR)!

## POINTER 18
Wonder Chef
I know how to choose a good chef!

## POINTER 19

It seems that Chef <STR>(YUR)'s dishes left 
a favorable impression on our panel!

## POINTER 20
Leblanc
Hmph, it's good enough 
to eat, I suppose.

## POINTER 21
Kaufman
The taste is all right. I'd eat 
it if someone else were paying.

## POINTER 22
Ioder
Ahh, so this is what the 
common people eat...

## POINTER 23
<STR>(KAR)
Meh, I've had better...

## POINTER 24
Wonder Chef
Could it...could it be that I erred 
in my chef selection? No, it 
cannot be. It simply cannot!

## POINTER 25

Could this mean the 
end for Chef <STR>(YUR)?!

## POINTER 26

Next, the dishes of our challenger 
from the empire, Chef <STR>(FRE)!

## POINTER 27
<STR>(KAR)
Wow, this looks so nice...

## POINTER 28
Ioder
This is art...with the 
plate as the canvas.

## POINTER 29
Kaufman
It's not every day that I see 
food so beautiful that I 
hesitate to bite into it.

## POINTER 30
Wonder Chef
That man has mastered the essence 
of cooking. He is a culinary 
force to be reckoned with!

## POINTER 31
Leblanc
Mmm....uck?!

## POINTER 32
Kaufman
Ick...

## POINTER 33
<STR>(KAR)
Wargh?!

## POINTER 34

W-what is this? Our judge's panel is 
in a state of total chaos! One by 
one, they are dropping like flies!

## POINTER 35
<STR>(FRE)
Master Ioder, what do you think?

## POINTER 36
Ioder
...It appears I've made 
the wrong choice.

## POINTER 37
<STR>(FRE)
It wasn't to your liking? 
I'm sorry...<PAGE>I thought that I did a good job, too...

## POINTER 38
Wonder Chef
This is sacrilege against the 
culinary art! You ought to 
be ashamed of yourself!!

## POINTER 39
<STR>(RAV)
The panel's goin' ta hell 
in a handbasket...

## POINTER 40
<STR>(RIT)
Did <STR>(FRE) poison that 
food or something?

## POINTER 41
<STR>(JUD)
You know, I was watching him as 
he cooked, and I think he might 
just have no sense of taste.<PAGE>No one with a normal set of 
taste buds would've seasoned 
that food like he did.

## POINTER 42
<STR>(RAV)
But how can ya season somethin' 
so badly that all the judges 
keel over? That's impressive!

## POINTER 43
<STR>(RIT)
Bad cooking can be a 
formidable weapon.

## POINTER 44

And now!! It's time 
for the verdict. The 
judges have chosen...

## POINTER 45

...The Guilds! Chef 
<STR>(YUR) is the winner!

## POINTER 46
<STR>(YUR)
Tough luck, <STR>(FRE).

## POINTER 47
<STR>(JUD)
<STR>(YUR)'s too good to lose 
to cooking like that!

## POINTER 48
<STR>(FRE)
I admit defeat. Good job, <STR>(YUR).

## POINTER 49
<STR>(YUR)
If you'd followed the recipe 
more closely, it could've just 
as easily been my loss.

## POINTER 50
Sodia
This can't be right! Let 
me taste that food!

## POINTER 51
Witcher
Sodia, no offense to the acting 
commandant, but I believe that's 
simply too dangerous.

## POINTER 52

In recognition for your victory, Chef 
<STR>(YUR), we're awarding you the prestigious 
title of Commoner Chef.<PAGE>Congratulations!

## POINTER 53

...The Empire! Chef 
<STR>(FRE) is the winner!

## POINTER 54
<STR>(FRE)
Thank you.

## POINTER 55
<STR>(YUR)
Damn it. I guess I got beaten 
in the appearance and 
composition categories.

## POINTER 56

We'll be looking forward to giving 
the Guild's team a chance to 
redeem themselves next year!

## POINTER 57

And this brings the first annual 
Fortune's Banquet exhibition match 
to an end! See you all next year!
