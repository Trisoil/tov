## POINTER 121
Prince Ioder arrived in Heliord 
today from Capua Torim, where he 
had been previously stationed.

Having learned of obstacles preventing 
the establishment of a friendship 
treaty with the Union, the Prince 
has chosen the frontier town as a 
<PAGE>
base from which to renew negotiations 
with the guilds, due to its increased 
proximity to Dahngrest.

The Union has also instructed Raven 
to travel with Brave Vesperia in 
their efforts to monitor the movements 
of Princess Estellise.

## POINTER 122
Watch Out for Mermen

## POINTER 123
A ship belonging to Fortune's Market 
has set sail from Torim. Although 
the waters are thick with schools 
of mermen searching for prey at 
this time of year, the guild president 
seemed adamant about leaving 
the harbor town behind.

<PAGE>
Hired on to serve as guards for the 
duration of the voyage, Brave Vesperia 
has been promised free use of 
the craft if they can help it 
reach its destination safely.

The guild has set sail on the open 
sea with a course set for the 
southern city of Nordopolica.

## POINTER 124
Defeating the Mermen

## POINTER 125
The Fiertia, a ship carrying 
the cargo of the Fortune's Market 
guild, ran into a group 
of mermen this afternoon.

The cargo appears to have been saved 
however, thanks to the efforts 
of Brave Vesperia, a guild serving 
as guards aboard the vessel.

<PAGE>
The mermen possess enough reason 
not to attack any ship that has defeated 
them a second time, and so the 
Fiertia is estimated to be in 
the clear for the remainder of 
its voyage toward Nordopolica.

## POINTER 126
Ghost Ship in the Mist

## POINTER 127
The Fiertia, a vessel belonging 
to Fortune's Market, appears 
to have collided with a ghost 
ship this afternoon.

Members of Brave Vesperia boarded 
the mysterious craft to investigate. 
After they failed to return, 
however, the remaining members 
<PAGE>
grew worried and have now 
gone looking for them.

The president of Fortune's 
Market, a Ms. Kaufman, stayed 
with the Fiertia, hoping for 
the guild's safe return.

## POINTER 128
What's in the Box?

## POINTER 129
Brave Vesperia discovered 
a small red box within the 
captain's cabin of the ghost 
ship they boarded today.

The Captain's log confirmed that 
the ship has been around for 1000 
years, and that its mission was 
to bring a so-called clear ciel 
<PAGE>
crystal to the town of Yormgen 
as a means of defending its residents 
from monster attacks.

Having made up their minds to 
deliver the clear ciel crystal 
to Yormgen themselves, Brave 
Vesperia took the box and 
has returned to the Fiertia.

## POINTER 130
A City Ringing with Warrior Songs

## POINTER 131
Brave Vesperia arrived at the city 
of Nordopolica this morning.

Their companion, Raven, revealed himself 
to be an officer of the guild Altosk. 
He has come to deliver a letter 
from Don Whitehorse to Belius, 
the Duce of Nordopolica.

<PAGE>
Brave Vesperia may use the 
opportunity to introduce themselves 
to Belius as well.

Nordopolica's leader does not meet 
with just anyone, however. Those 
who seek an audience with her must 
first receive the approval of 
the city's guild, Palestralle.

## POINTER 132
New Moon Duce

## POINTER 133
The members of Brave Vesperia visited 
the headquarters of the Palestralle 
guild in hopes of meeting with 
Nordopolica's ruler, Belius.

But according to the Duce's 
retainer Natz, Belius only 
makes appearances on the 
evening of the new moon.

<PAGE>
The new guild has taken up residence 
at an inn in the city to wait for 
the arrival of the next new moon.

## POINTER 134
Coliseum Quarrel

## POINTER 135
Regaey, boss of the guild Ruins' 
Gate, was hurt today when he 
attempted to break up a quarrel 
between two guildmates.

After observing Yuri's skill 
in resolving the conflict, the 
boss then asked Brave Vesperia 
to take on a new job.

<PAGE>
Though Yuri is still on the fence 
about accepting the work, Regaey 
is apparently waiting for the 
guild at the entrance to 
the city's famed coliseum.

## POINTER 136
It's the Title Bout!

## POINTER 137
Yuri faced off against defending 
champion Flynn in a rare match against 
friends for today's coliseum title 
bout. The latter is rumored to 
have originally entered the tournament 
for work-related reasons. Regaey 
hired Yuri to defeat the reigning 
champion, but the two now realize 
that they have been tricked 
by the guild boss.

<PAGE>
A sudden appearance by Zagi put the 
match on hold, and when Regaey made 
his escape, Brave Vesperia was seen 
heading west, hot on his heels.

## POINTER 138
An Aer-Filled Cave

## POINTER 139
A geyser of aer was found to 
be pouring out of the Weasand of 
Cados this afternoon.

Fortunately, a crisis was avoided 
when a strange monster appeared and 
stabilized the environment. Amidst 
this confusion, Regaey was revealed 
<PAGE>
to be none other than Yeager, leader 
of the guild Leviathan's Claw. 
The duplicitous boss evaded his 
pursuers during the chaos.

Brave Vesperia's resident blastia 
expert, Rita, appears to have put her 
investigation of the cave on hold 
in favor of chasing after Yeager.

## POINTER 140
The Wind-Swept Oasis

## POINTER 141
Late this afternoon, Brave Vesperia 
arrived in Mantaic, a town lying 
between the foothills and the central 
areas of the Sands of Kogorh.

The guild is currently divided 
on whether or not they should proceed 
further into the desert.

<PAGE>
Many of Mantaic's previous visitors 
have been faced with this same decision, 
and Brave Vesperia's members 
will give the matter some serious 
thought before proceeding.

## POINTER 142
Forward, Into the Desert

## POINTER 143
Estellise released Brave Vesperia 
from their contract with her this 
afternoon. Nevertheless, she paid 
the guild their agreed-upon sum, 
insisting on calling it a keepsake 
of their travels together.

<PAGE>
The Princess appeared set upon 
going into the unforgiving desert 
alone. Unable to allow this, 
the guild has pledged to continue 
on as her guardians.

The party was last seen entering 
the inn to prepare for their coming 
trek into the desert sands.

## POINTER 144
The Magistrate's Unreasonable Demands

## POINTER 145
Brave Vesperia came across a group 
of Imperial Knights harassing 
two young children today and put 
a stop to the mistreatment.

The Knights withdrew apologetically 
upon recognizing Princess 
Estellise.

<PAGE>
The brother and sister were apparently 
setting out to search for their parents 
who had been sent to the desert 
by order of the magistrate.

Brave Vesperia is now planning to 
enter the desert to find the missing 
parents in place of the children.

## POINTER 146
Where the Cacti Grow

## POINTER 147
Exhausted and weary, the members 
of Brave Vesperia took shelter at 
a small oasis they stumbled upon 
in the middle of the desert.

The guild had been gathering water 
from any cacti they happened 
to find, but with water bottles 
empty and the heat beating down 
<PAGE>
relentlessly, they were but moments 
from collapse when they came 
across the sanctuary.

They will have to be more 
frugal with their water stores 
if they hope to survive 
in the desert after this.

## POINTER 148
A Legendary Utopia

## POINTER 149
Having gone missing last night in 
the Sands of Kogorh, Brave Vesperia 
was found today to be resting in a 
northern desert town with a couple 
believed to be the missing parents 
of the two children in Mantaic.

The guild had encountered a strange 
monster in the central desert 
<PAGE>
prior to this, and found themselves 
sapped of all strength when 
they prepared to do battle 
with the creature.

The guild has learned that the 
town is none other than Yormgen, 
mentioned by the Captain of 
the ghost ship in his journal, 
<PAGE>
and have begun to explore their 
surroundings in earnest.

## POINTER 150
A Broken Clear Ciel Crystal

## POINTER 151
The clear ciel crystal retrieved 
from the ghost ship by Brave Vesperia 
was shattered today by Duke, a 
man known in Yormgen as the Sage, 
when the guild handed it to him. 
Details surrounding this figure 
remain unclear as he has so far 
declined any explanation of 
his person or his actions.

<PAGE>
Having abandoned their plan of meeting 
Phaeroh, the guild appears to be preparing 
for a return to Nordopolica 
via Mantaic to speak with Belius 
on the night of the new moon.

## POINTER 152
Oppression Hits a Speed Bump

## POINTER 153
A cart laden with people being sent 
to the desert by the Knights was 
stalled in Mantaic this morning 
when it broke down on its way out 
of town. This event is expected 
to put an end to the forced removal 
of the town's citizens.

<PAGE>
Brave Vesperia was outraged to find 
the infamous Captain Cumore in charge 
of the garrison here, and will 
remain in the town for the time 
being to monitor the situation.

## POINTER 154
Tyrant Gone Missing?

## POINTER 155
The whereabouts of Captain Cumore 
have been unknown since sometime 
last evening. Captain Flynn had 
taken over stewardship of Mantaic 
from Cumore, but appears to 
have withdrawn to Nordopolica 
with the ban on travel to and 
from Mantaic now lifted.

<PAGE>
Brave Vesperia is rumored to have 
been involved in the Captain's 
disappearance, but the veracity 
of such claims is uncertain. The 
guild has its sights set on Nordopolica 
as well, hoping to gain 
an audience with Belius.

## POINTER 156
A Blocked Windpipe

## POINTER 157
The Weasand of Cados has been under 
blockade by the Knights since 
yesterday afternoon. The imperials 
appear to be taking security 
quite seriously, having gone 
so far as to bring trained monsters 
with them to the cave.

<PAGE>
Upon approaching, Brave Vesperia 
used the monsters to their 
advantage and managed to break 
through the blockade.

Having emerged on the continent's 
eastern plains, the group is 
now making for Nordopolica.

## POINTER 158
A Moonless Night

## POINTER 159
Brave Vesperia arrived in Nordopolica 
just after noon today.

The guild plans to seek information 
regarding the monster Phaeroh 
from Belius, and to deliver a 
letter from the Don to the Duce 
as well.

<PAGE>
They arrive to find Nordopolica undisturbed, 
despite pressure from the Knights 
and the nearby blockade.
