## POINTER 2
Broken Aque Blastia

## POINTER 3
The aque blastia in the lower 
quarter of the imperial capital 
broke this morning, flooding the 
entire plaza there. The townspeople 
are doing all they can to remove 
the water, but the situation 
has yet to improve.

<PAGE>
The flood is thought to be the 
fault of a Mr. Mordio, a mage 
who had come to repair the blastia, 
but ended up stealing the core 
that powers it instead.

<PAGE>
With this information in hand, Yuri, 
a youth from the lower quarter, is 
following Mordio back to the royal 
quarter to track the mage down.

## POINTER 4
Infiltrate the Royal Quarter!

## POINTER 5
Yuri was arrested by knights of the 
Cumore Brigade after breaking into 
the residence of Mr. Mordio.

<PAGE>
He was also charged with the
harassment of Sirs Adecor and
Boccos, and is currently being
held in the castle dungeon.
<PAGE>
The Knights planned on questioning 
Mordio as well, but the mage 
appears to have already 
left the imperial capital.

## POINTER 6
Dungeon Escape

## POINTER 7
The alleged criminal, Yuri, 
made an escape from the castle 
dungeon last night.

The suspect was last seen talking 
with the shady-looking man who 
occupied the neighboring cell.

<PAGE>
According to the guard on duty 
at the time, the two were discussing 
a "statue of the goddess." By 
the time this information surfaced 
however, the mystery man who 
may hold the only clue to this 
case, had been released.

## POINTER 8
Meeting with a Mystery Girl

## POINTER 9
Estellise, a young lady of the 
castle, was reported by her guards 
to have been accompanying the 
suspect, Yuri, last evening.

It is assumed that the criminal 
took the young lady with 
him after subduing the knights 
who were her escort.

<PAGE>
Certain knights have claimed the 
young lady left the castle in search 
of a Lieutenant Flynn, but further 
details are as yet unknown.

## POINTER 10
Assassin's Strike

## POINTER 11
Witnesses reported a scuffle between 
Yuri and a man identified only 
as "Zagi" in Lieutenant Flynn's 
chambers this morning before 
dawn. Both parties had apparently 
come in search of Flynn.

The lieutenant is currently on a 
pilgrimage however, and was not 
present when the melee ensued.

<PAGE>
Rumors have circulated that Estellise 
was accompanying the fugitive, 
Yuri, following these events, 
but the head of security has 
stated that aside from going 
underground, escape from within 
the castle is impossible.

## POINTER 12
Secret Passage

## POINTER 13
The Knights have announced the discovery 
of an underground passage leading 
from within the castle to the royal 
quarter. Both Yuri and Zagi are 
assumed to have used it as their 
means of escape. The Knights are 
focusing their search in the lower 
quarter, as Yuri is expected 
to return to his home there.

<PAGE>
A spokesperson from the Imperial 
Research Institute has speculated 
that "the underground passage 
may have been intended as an 
escape route for the royal family 
in times of emergency."

## POINTER 14
Go North, Young Man

## POINTER 15
Hanks, resident of the lower 
quarter, has stated that Yuri 
has successfully evaded the 
Knights and left the capital.

Hanks claims that Yuri left in 
pursuit of the alleged blastia thief, 
a Mr. Mordio, and that a "cute 
young thing, name of Estellise" 
was with him at the time.<PAGE>
If Yuri is truly in pursuit of this 
Mordio, he will most likely be headed 
for Aspio, a destination that 
would take him to the north.

## POINTER 16
Formidable Fort

## POINTER 17
Deidon Hold is a fort that lies 
to the north of the capital. 
In the season that monsters prowl 
the northern plains, the gates 
are closed and passage through 
the Hold is forbidden.

<PAGE>
It would appear that Yuri, 
a young man who recently escaped 
from the capital, has made 
his way to the fort.

It is not uncommon for merchants 
and travelers to conduct business 
at the Hold while they 
await its reopening.

<PAGE>
Yuri is assumed to be mingling with 
the other travelers in attempts to 
gather information and supplies.

## POINTER 18
Rescue Operations

## POINTER 19
Just past noon today, Yuri and Estellise 
were involved in rescuing a number 
of people from a monster attack 
outside of Deidon Hold.

With the closure of the Hold following 
this event, the pair were assumed to have
returned to the capital. 
<PAGE>
Kaufman, the president of the 
Fortune's Market guild, is said to have
informed them of an alternate route through 
the woods to the west.

With all of the stories surrounding
the Quoi Woods, can the two really
be planning to go there?

## POINTER 20
The Forest Curse

## POINTER 21
Yuri is supposed to have entered 
the Quoi Woods this afternoon.

With the suspension of travel through 
Deidon Hold, Yuri was expected 
to abandon his plans to go to 
Aspio. His decision to brave 
the perils of the woods, however, 
may keep his hopes alive.

<PAGE>
According to Yuri's companion, Estellise, 
the Quoi Woods are plagued by a 
curse. Despite this, the two appear 
to have gathered up their courage 
and entered the forest.

## POINTER 22
The Swooning Maiden

## POINTER 23
This afternoon, Estellise collapsed 
in the Quoi Woods after suffering 
a sudden turn in her disposition.

Yuri did his best to take care 
of his companion, but the cause 
of her discomfort is unknown.

<PAGE>
The two noted that the broken blastia 
in the vicinity may have been to blame 
in some way. With his sights set 
on Aspio, Yuri has resolved to press 
deeper into the Quoi Woods.

## POINTER 24
Attack of the Hunter

## POINTER 25
Late this afternoon, Yuri and 
Estellise were set upon by 
young Karol Capel, a member 
of the Hunting Blades.

The conflict turned out to be a 
misunderstanding on Karol's part, 
and blows were thankfully avoided. 
<PAGE>
Hopefully, this will serve as 
a reminder to other guild members 
not to jump to conclusions.

Though Karol had just come from 
the town of Halure to the north, 
he appears to have returned there 
with Yuri and Estellise.

## POINTER 26
Trouble in the Town of Blossoms

## POINTER 27
Sometime past noon yesterday, the 
town of Halure was attacked by 
monsters. The monsters were defeated 
by a knight on a pilgrimage, 
but many appear to have been 
injured in the struggle.

The young healer Estellise, passing 
through the town by chance today, 
tended to the injured. 
<PAGE>
However, the inactive barrier blastia 
has yet to be restored.

The town has pinned its hopes on Yuri, 
who examined Halure's famous tree 
for some sign of a solution...

But will he succeed?

## POINTER 28
O Tree, Return to Beauty

## POINTER 29
With a panacea bottle, the blighted 
soil causing the tree to 
rot may be cleansed...

With these words, Karol has returned 
to the Quoi Woods with Yuri 
in hopes of finding the eggbear 
claw and nia fruit required 
to make the remedy.<PAGE>
The mayor holds the luluria 
petal which the boy claims 
is the final ingredient.

## POINTER 30
Restoring the Tree

## POINTER 31
This afternoon, Yuri and his 
friends found and defeated 
the eggbear of Quoi Woods.

Karol smeared himself with some of 
the nia fruit's pungent juice to 
lure the eggbear out of hiding.

<PAGE>
Following this, the party returned
to town with the eggbear claw and
the nia fruit, and combined it with
the luluria petal to complete the
panacea bottle. Having received this
news, the townspeople eagerly awaited
the return of the blossoms.

## POINTER 32
The Girl who Makes Miracles

## POINTER 33
Just after noontime today, the 
tree of Halure was returned to 
health. Spirits fell at first when 
the panacea bottle failed to have 
any effect, but then Estellise 
brought about a miracle.

The power she used restored the 
tree, but just how she managed it 
remains unclear at this time.

<PAGE>
The young lady fled the town shortly 
after, to escape her pursuers. 
The mayor has said she will be 
remembered for generations to 
come as the girl who gave Halure 
a much-needed miracle.

## POINTER 34
Onward to Aspio

## POINTER 35
According to the mayor, the target 
of Estellise's search, a Lieutenant 
Flynn, has made his way east.

As Yuri's destination of Aspio also
lies in that direction, the two have
agreed to continue their travels
together. The young Karol appears to
have gone with them in hopes of
rejoining his friends at the harbor.

## POINTER 36
The City Hidden in the Mountains

## POINTER 37
Three people appeared with a dog 
at the gates of Aspio this morning 
requesting to meet with Flynn, though 
they lacked a passport. A young 
man in the group also expressed 
his desire to meet with a Mr. Mordio. 
The trio is said to have withdrawn 
after being refused entry by 
the guards, but did not appear 
willing to admit defeat.

<PAGE>
Anticipating the possibility of 
an illegal break-in, the city guard 
is expected to tighten security 
at the rear gate as well.

## POINTER 38
The Genius Mage of Aspio

## POINTER 39
An explosion was reported on the outskirts 
of Aspio at around noon today. The 
blast came from the residence of 
one Rita Mordio. The incident is 
assumed to be linked to Yuri's pursuit 
of Mordio as the alleged blastia 
thief. Rita denies the charges, 
and has set out with the party 
for the Shaikos Ruins to the 
east to prove her innocence.

## POINTER 40
The Floating Ruins

## POINTER 41
This afternoon, Rita paid a visit 
to the ruins of Shaikos to the east 
of Aspio, for research purposes. 
Recent excavations have uncovered 
vast caverns stretching out beneath 
the once-proud stone remains.

<PAGE>
The party has discovered numerous 
sets of footprints coming and 
going from the ruins. Now suspecting 
thievery herself, Rita has 
apparently led the party into 
the subterranean caverns.
