## POINTER 43
Rita suffered mild injuries while 
investigating a humanoid blastia today, 
when it sprang suddenly to life 
and attacked. Estellise was on the 
scene as well and treated Rita's 
wounds with her healing artes.

<PAGE>
The blastia had been activated by a 
ransacking band of thieves. Hoping 
that pursuing them would lead to information 
about the stolen aque blastia, Yuri 
chased after the person they encountered, 
but not before toppling 
the guardian of the ruins.

## POINTER 44
Who's Afraid of a Band of Thieves?

## POINTER 45
The ruin robber was captured yesterday 
in the pre-dawn hours. From him, 
the party learned that the recent 
blastia theft has been the work of 
a large-scale organization orchestrated 
by a single person. This kingpin 
was revealed to be a towering, one-eyed 
man based in the port town of Torim. 
<PAGE>
To reach Torim on the neighboring 
continent, the party must first 
travel to the port of Nor, 
and they have returned to Aspio 
with this goal in mind.

Now, the thief they caught is 
thought to have been turned over 
to the authorities in Aspio.

## POINTER 46
Genius Mages Need Friends Too

## POINTER 47
The guards of Aspio made inquiries 
into the sudden disappearance of town 
eccentric, Rita Mordio. Last seen 
on her way out of the city, the mage 
is assumed to be setting off on 
a journey. Word has it that Rita 
was joined by Estellise, headed 
to Halure to meet up with her friend 
Flynn. 
<PAGE>
The mage plans to confirm 
the safety of Halure's restored 
barrier blastia for herself.

With Rita cleared of suspicion, Yuri 
even offered up a rare apology.

## POINTER 48
A Mage's Curiosity

## POINTER 49
Rita, the blastia mage said to 
have left Aspio, was spotted today 
on the streets of Halure.

Upon seeing the town's great tree, 
which Rita assumed to be withered, 
witnesses say the young mage was 
struck dumb with surprise.

<PAGE>
The restoration of Halure's tree 
seems to have touched off a 
spark of curiosity in Rita.

Many have witnessed her busying 
herself at the tree's base, 
and she appears to be conducting 
her research in earnest.

## POINTER 50
Wanted Man

## POINTER 51
Last evening, the Knights posted 
their latest list of wanted criminals, 
and Yuri Lowell's name appeared 
among them. So far, however, 
the young man has slipped easily 
through the fingers of Lieutenant 
Leblanc and his men.

<PAGE>
Yuri has set his sights on Nor, 
to the west, convinced that the 
one-eyed man is the missing piece 
in the puzzle of the stolen blastia. 
Word on the street says Estellise's 
chances of running into 
Flynn in Nor are high.

## POINTER 52
A Hill with a View

## POINTER 53
The barrier blastia atop Ehmead 
Hill was destroyed suddenly 
today by the "dragon rider".

No one was injured, but the Knights 
have set up a watch as the barrier 
is currently inoperable.

<PAGE>
The Knights responded to a second 
disturbance caused by a female mage 
who tried to approach the blastia. 
This mage is assumed to be none 
other than Rita Mordio. The young 
lady appears to have escaped 
with Yuri and her other companions 
to the top of the hill.

## POINTER 54
Over the Hill We Go

## POINTER 55
Yuri and his party were assaulted 
by a gattuso this afternoon, as 
they attempted to cross over Ehmead 
Hill. The gattuso was among the 
monsters that had previously 
attacked the town of Halure.

<PAGE>
Fortunately, the party seems 
to have dispatched the beast 
without incident. With this, 
Halure should be safe from 
any further monster raids.

After gazing down at the ocean 
from atop the hill, the party 
began their descent toward Nor.

## POINTER 56
Storms in the Harbor

## POINTER 57
Today at noon, Yuri was attacked 
by a group of "red eyes" on one 
of Nor's many back alleys. Hearing 
the commotion, Flynn and his 
patrol joined the fray and 
dispersed the assailants.

<PAGE>
Having found Flynn in good health 
after her lengthy journey, Estellise 
went with the lieutenant to the 
inn to catch up on recent events.

Yuri is doing his best to stay 
busy in town while waiting 
for their meeting to end.

## POINTER 58
The Tyrant Magistrate

## POINTER 59
Estellise sought an audience 
with Nor's magistrate, Ragou, 
suspecting his rule to be 
unjust, but was denied.

Having heard of the magistrate's 
desire for the horn of a monster 
called Rhybgaro, the party set out 
for the town's outlying areas in 
hopes of capturing the beast.

<PAGE>
Meanwhile, Flynn, accompanied by 
the mage Witcher from Aspio, is preparing 
to exercise his authority to 
investigate Ragou's mansion.

## POINTER 60
In Search of Rhybgaro

## POINTER 61
Yuri and his companions defeated 
a golden monster on the plains 
outside Nor this afternoon.

The creature was none other than 
Rhybgaro, who had been released into 
the wild by the harbor magistrate. 
The party collected the beast's 
horn, and then set it free.

<PAGE>
With the monster no longer of 
value, the magistrate has no reason 
to force those who fail to 
pay their taxes to hunt it.

## POINTER 62
Monsters in the Basement

## POINTER 63
A brigand by the name of Raven stole 
into the magistrate's mansion earlier 
today. He seems to have managed 
the feat by using Yuri and his companions 
to create a diversion.

In the ensuing turmoil, the party 
dispatched several of the mercenaries 
hired to guard the estate.

<PAGE>
Tricked by Raven, they eventually 
found themselves locked in the 
mansion's basement. The group 
saw signs of monsters being kept 
there, but to what purpose, 
they could not say. How will 
they get out of this mess?

## POINTER 64
Rumble at Ragou's Mansion

## POINTER 65
Earlier this evening, a fire broke 
out at the magistrate's mansion.

The blaze is thought to have started 
when the dragon rider destroyed 
a blastia at the estate.

<PAGE>
Lieutenant Flynn and his men happened 
to be on patrol nearby and discovered 
an illegal blastia in the magistrate's 
possession when he responded to 
the emergency. Before they could 
question the official, he boarded 
a ship and fled the scene.

<PAGE>
Rather than give chase, the Knights 
focused their efforts on subduing 
the fire, leaving Yuri and friends 
to pursue the runaway Ragou.

## POINTER 66
From a Sinking Ship

## POINTER 67
Ragou's personal ship was sunk off 
the bay of Torim late this afternoon. 
The boss of the Blood Alliance, 
also aboard the vessel, was revealed 
to be the ringleader behind 
the theft of blastia cores.

<PAGE>
The magistrate and his crew made their 
escape in life boats, but Yuri and 
his companions were left aboard the 
sinking ship.
<PAGE>
The group was thankfully 
rescued by the Knights, and Yuri 
himself saved a young man who would 
have gone down with the ship. 
Eager to learn the details of 
the incident, Flynn awaits a meeting 
with Yuri at Torim's inn.

## POINTER 68
Unpunished Crimes

## POINTER 69
The magistrate of Nor underwent questioning 
today at the hands of Lieutenant 
Flynn. The Knight charged the official 
with possession of illegal blastia 
and the alleged abduction of Prince 
Ioder, a candidate for the throne. 
Due to lack of evidence, however, 
Ragou was set free.

<PAGE>
After receiving a tip about a band 
of fighters believed to be Barbos's 
Blood Alliance, Yuri and his 
companions have set out for 
a town northwest of Torim.

## POINTER 70
Warning from the Hunting Blades

## POINTER 71
The city of Caer Bocram on the 
Tolbyccian continent was placed 
under the control of the Hunting 
Blades guild today, with entry 
forbidden to all others. 

<PAGE>
Though the city was reduced to rubble 
in an earthquake over ten years 
prior, the continued presence of 
monsters there makes it a prime 
hunting spot for the guild.

Harsh words were exchanged between 
Karol and his former guildmate, Nan, 
when the party sought to enter.

## POINTER 72
A Cave Beneath the Ruins

## POINTER 73
A terrible monster lay in wait 
beneath the ruins of Caer 
Bocram... So spoke a member 
of the Hunting Blades.

The monster apparently flew 
into a rage when the blastia 
entrapping it was destroyed 
by the dragon rider.

<PAGE>
In the end, the monster was subdued 
by Yuri and his companions.

Calmed by the party's attack, the 
monster retreated to its lair in 
the city sewers. Following this, 
the party returned to the surface 
to leave the city and get 
back to their original task.

## POINTER 74
Lower Quarter Lad Arrested!

## POINTER 75
Yuri and his companions were 
placed under arrest by the 
Knights today upon leaving 
the city of Caer Bocram.

Estellise was also revealed 
to be an heir to the imperial 
throne, and Yuri has been charged 
with her kidnapping.

<PAGE>
Considering the numerous other offenses 
hung on his name, the Knights 
are expected to take the youth 
to Heliord for questioning.

In the end, the tip Yuri received 
regarding the Blood Alliance led 
him only to the Hunting Blades.

## POINTER 76
A Full Pardon

## POINTER 77
The Imperial Knights absolved Yuri 
Lowell of his crimes today, as compensation 
for aiding in the rescue of Prince 
Ioder and for his protection 
of Princess Estellise.

Though his arrest at Caer Bocram 
was undone immediately, Yuri 
did not appear overjoyed following 
his release at Heliord.

<PAGE>
Yuri is hoping to meet one final 
time with the Princess, who is scheduled 
to return to the capital.

## POINTER 78
Blastia Problems

## POINTER 79
"It's not supposed to make that 
sound..." Rita Mordio was overheard 
making this comment in regards 
to Heliord's barrier blastia, during 
her visit to the city today. 

The mage also reported witnessing 
disturbances in the aer at 
Caer Bocram, and is growing 
increasingly worried.

<PAGE>
This time however, with the 
Knights on hand, Yuri decided 
to let the ever-dependable 
Flynn deal with the problem.

## POINTER 80
Genius Mage to the Rescue

## POINTER 81
Heliord's barrier blastia went 
berserk today, flooding the city 
with excessive amounts of aer.

Rita quickly made adjustments to 
the blastia, getting the situation 
under control mere moments before 
the device exploded, but she 
was injured in the process.

<PAGE>
Rita was rushed to an inn by the 
Knights. Estellise is watching 
over her now, doing all she can 
to heal the girl with her artes.
