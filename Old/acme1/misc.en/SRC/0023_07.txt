To the Ancient Spire

## POINTER 277
It was decided at yesterday's 
assembly that the world's blastia 
cores will be used to eradicate 
the Adephagos.

According to the plan, the cores 
will be converted into spirit 
form and injected into Vesperia 
One. The colossal entity will 
then be hit with the combined

power of all the spirits.
Wanting to get as close to their 
target as possible, Brave Vesperia 
has set out for the soaring 
Tower of Tarqaron.

The Man who Raised Babel

## POINTER 279
Brave Vesperia arrived at the base 
of Tarqaron tower today at noon.

The guild has its sights set on the 
summit, ready to use Vesperia One 
to wipe out the Adephagos. But what 
of the man known as Duke and his 
purposes in resurrecting the towering 
monument? The world waits with 
baited breath to see how he will

respond to the presence of the 
guild, upon whose shoulders 
the hopes of humanity rest.

Assassin's Last Stand

## POINTER 281
The assassin Zagi appeared suddenly 
before the guild today in 
the tower of Tarqaron.

The persistent killer has tracked 
the guild down numerous times, but 
their clashes have always ended in 
his defeat. With every loss, the desperate 
Zagi has had another part of 
his body remade as a blastia.

<PAGE>
Always returning to hound the guild, 
no matter how badly he was beaten, 
Zagi has fallen at last to Yuri's 
blade. The battle won, Brave Vesperia 
continued their ascent toward the 
uppermost reaches of the spire.

Guild of Hope

## POINTER 283
Our heroes, Brave Vesperia, appear 
to have finally arrived at Tarqaron's 
lofty pinnacle. Will the plan to 
convert the world's blastia into 
spirits succeed? And if it does, 
can their power be used to truly 
eliminate the Adephagos?

<PAGE>
And what role will be played 
by the enigmatic Duke 
in these final hours?!

Now we have only to believe; in the 
unity that binds us to each other, 
and in victory for Brave Vesperia.
