Save Points are advanced formulas left in cities
and forests created by mages for the purpose of
collecting records of travelers.
Even if you quit your journey, you can 
resume from your last record, by saving your 
progress over the Save Points.
The Save Points are available in places all
around the world. Make sure to save your
progress when you find them!
