## POINTER 238
Falling Down

## POINTER 239
A beam of light was seen shooting 
from the fortress shrine of 
Zaude yesterday, and preceded 
the appearance of a colossal 
monster in the sky.

Alexei, who is thought to have triggered 
the light, was defeated by Yuri, 
but the young man appears to have 
<PAGE>
fallen from the shrine itself after 
delivering the mortal blow.

The Knights staged a search of the 
surrounding waters, but called off 
their efforts at nightfall, having 
found no sign of Yuri's remains.

<PAGE>
Though assumed dead, Brave Vesperia 
has not given up hope for 
their friend's survival.

## POINTER 240
The Man in Black Returns

## POINTER 241
It was confirmed last night that 
the lower quarter youth, Yuri, 
though earlier pronounced dead, 
is still among the living.

Princess Estellise, currently 
staying in the lower quarter 
herself, was overcome with relief 
and rushed to inform her companions 
of the good news.

<PAGE>
After meeting with Judith, Yuri is 
said to have made for Aspio, to learn 
the results of the mage's research 
concerning the shrine of Zaude.

## POINTER 242
Home Sweet Dahngrest

## POINTER 243
From her research on the Adephagos, 
which appeared during the recent 
incident at Zaude, Rita has determined 
that, left unchecked, the current 
imbalance of aer will usher 
in a catastrophe of previously 
unknown proportions.

<PAGE>
The mage has rejoined Brave Vesperia 
in hopes of stopping the Adephagos, 
and is engrossed in the problem 
of inhibiting the world's 
production of aer.

The guild appears to have made 
Dahngrest its next destination.

## POINTER 244
Humanity's Legacy

## POINTER 245
The theft of the cyano ciel crystal 
from the private chambers of Don 
Whitehorse was reported this evening. 
The late Union leader was entrusted 
with the item on the occasion 
of the demise of Belius.

Though the Brave Vesperia guild 
is under suspicion, Harry, the 
Don's grandson and successor, is 
<PAGE>
said to have no intention of pressing 
charges in the matter.

Last seen heading for the Zopheir 
Rift, Brave Vesperia is rumored 
to be using the stolen object 
in an experiment designed to forestall 
the coming apocalypse.

## POINTER 246
Birthplace of the Spirits

## POINTER 247
Brave Vesperia was seen entering 
the Zopheir Rift this afternoon, 
and witnesses say they were 
carrying the cyano ciel crystal, 
recently stolen from Dahngrest, 
in their possession.

The guild apparently intends to 
use the crystal to convert the 
<PAGE>
aer produced by the world's aer 
krene into physical matter.

The ploy could mean an end to 
the overabundance of aer currently 
threatening the world, 
but will it succeed...?

## POINTER 248
The Adephagos Awakens

## POINTER 249
Light was witnessed radiating from 
the fortress shrine of Zaude again 
this evening. Its effect has 
caused the world's barriers to 
vanish, and the Adephagos appears 
to have redoubled its assault 
on the planet as well.

<PAGE>
Though successful with their experiments 
in the Zopheir Rift, Brave Vesperia 
learned that a portion of the 
Adephagos has launched an attack 
on Nordopolica. Calling a halt 
to their research, the guild 
is speeding toward the coliseum 
city in hopes of defending 
it from the onslaught.

## POINTER 250
Crisis Strikes Nordopolica

## POINTER 251
After arriving in the coliseum 
city, Brave Vesperia succeeded 
in obliterating the piece of the 
Adephagos that had threatened to 
destroy the town. It appears that 
the creature had been consuming 
the aer responsible for maintaining 
the city's barrier.

<PAGE>
Brave Vesperia entered Nordopolica 
following the struggle and received 
the gratitude of Natz, the city's 
provisional Duce. Having confirmed 
the findings of their experiments 
by chance, the guild is gathering 
information that will allow their 
newfound power to create a 
new ally: elemental spirits.

## POINTER 252
Bodies in Crystal

## POINTER 253
The experiments conducted by Brave 
Vesperia have succeeded in producing 
a spirit at last. The guild has 
also announced that properly 
used, these entities could cause 
the Adephagos to manifest 
itself in physical form.

<PAGE>
But in order to accomplish this,
the guild must find materials similar 
in nature to the cyano ciel crystal. 
These substances may only be obtained 
from the souls of three of the 
so-called Entelexeia, located on 
the Crystal Isle northeast of 
Tolbyccia, in the mountains of 
the Sands of Kogorh, and on the 

<PAGE>
continent of Weccea, respectively. 
With this goal in mind, Brave 
Vesperia has set out in search 
of the ancient creatures.

## POINTER 254
An Island of Amethyst

## POINTER 255
Brave Vesperia has landed on the 
Crystal Isle, found in the waters 
off Tolbyccia's northeast coast.

Described as "a waking dream" by 
Estellise, the surreal scenery 
of the island appears to have profoundly 
affected the Princess.

<PAGE>
The guild has come in search of 
one of the three Entelexeia they 
must meet. If they succeed in pleading 
their case, they will gain 
the essence of a new spirit.

## POINTER 256
Birth of the Earth Spirit

## POINTER 257
Deep within the crystal forest of 
Erealumen today, Brave Vesperia 
came to the aid of the Hunting 
Blades who were under attack by 
the enraged Entelexeia, Gusios.

Determining that the ancient beast 
would fall under the power of 
the Adephagos if left unattended, 
the guild was unable to avoid 
<PAGE>
taking arms against it.

The apatheia received from the 
fallen Gusios became a spirit 
on the spot, and was renamed 
Gnome by Estellise, for his 
unyielding perserverance.

## POINTER 258
Primordial Scars

## POINTER 259
Brave Vesperia arrived at Relewiese 
today, on the continent of Weccea.

The surface of the continent, as 
yet untouched by the hand of humanity, 
lies high atop an impregnable 
cliff. The jagged rows of stone 
gullies and canyons extending 
to the horizon here struck the 
<PAGE>
guild as one of the most mysterious 
sights they have seen.

They have come in search of the 
Entelexeia who makes these lands 
its home, and if all goes well, 
they will gain another spirit.

## POINTER 260
A Spirit Remembers

## POINTER 261
After defeating the Entelexeia Khroma 
today in the ancient cave of Relewiese, 
Brave Vesperia acquired the spirit 
of Sylph from the apatheia they 
received. The name, given by 
Estellise, was explained to mean 
"he who binds the winds."

<PAGE>
Sylph then informed the guild 
of Duke's tragic past, in which 
Elucifur, the Entelexeia who fought 
with Duke in the Great War, 
was killed by the Empire.

## POINTER 262
A Fiery Resolve

## POINTER 263
The Entelexeia Phaeroh gave 
council to Brave Vesperia 
this morning in the mountains 
of the Sands of Kogorh.

Injured in the attack on Zaude, Phaeroh 
entrusted the guild with his hopes, 
and consenting to join their 
cause, became an apatheia.

<PAGE>
Brave Vesperia converted the 
crystal to its spirit form, 
giving it the name Efreet.

Estellise bestowed the title, 
and explained it to mean 
"the blazing one."

## POINTER 264
The Spirits Assembled

## POINTER 265
Brave Vesperia has succeeded 
in gathering together the 
four elemental spirits.

With that goal accomplished, Rita 
unveiled her plan to combat the 
Adephagos by converting the world's 
blastia cores into spirits.

<PAGE>
Estellise was quick to note that 
an operation of this magnitude 
will require the cooperation of 
the world's people, and the guild 
has resolved to wait until 
the time is right to act.

The group was last seen heading 
to Nor to lay preparations 
for the road ahead.

## POINTER 266
Return of the Ancient Tower

## POINTER 267
A tower reared up out of the ground 
near Aspio, just after noon today. 
Judging from the scale of the massive 
monolith, Aspio is thought to have 
been destroyed in the process.

Brave Vesperia claims this is 
the ancient Tower of Tarqaron, 
and believes its appearance 
to be the work of Duke.

<PAGE>
It would seem that the mysterious 
man wishes to do away with 
the Adephagos, though by what 
means, no one can yet say.

## POINTER 268
A Friend in Need

## POINTER 269
Beginning last night and extending 
on until dawn, the refugees from 
the capital were ambushed by monsters 
as they attempted to cross the 
eastern plains of Hypionia. 
Flynn and his brigade responded, 
and are doing all they can 
to repel the attackers.

<PAGE>
Lieutenant Sodia and the mage Witcher 
hurried to Nor to inform Brave Vesperia 
of the situation. Hearing the 
news, Yuri appears to have set 
out at once to aid his friend.

## POINTER 270
Hearts United

## POINTER 271
The last of the monsters that 
ambushed the imperial refugees 
were defeated this afternoon 
by Brave Vesperia.

Flynn took the occasion to 
announce his plans for an assembly 
of the world's leaders, to decide 
the best course of action 
against the Adephagos.

<PAGE>
Wishing for participation from 
all quarters, Brave Vesperia was 
given the role of emissary to 
the guilds, and the group 
departed immediately for 
Dahngrest and Nordopolica.

## POINTER 272
Vanquishing the World Eater

## POINTER 273
After negotiations with Brave 
Vesperia, Harry and Kaufman of 
the Union, and Natz of the Palestralle 
guild are confirmed to be attending 
the coming Adephagos summit 
being held at the encampment 
in eastern Hypionia.

<PAGE>
Rita will also be presenting the 
details of her worldwide plan for 
spirit conversion at the assembly.

## POINTER 274
A Town Alight with Hope

## POINTER 275
The town that has sprung up around 
the grounds of the Adephagos assembly 
under Flynn's guidance is still without 
a name. Some of the people now 
settled there have taken to calling 
the community "Flynn Town."

The fledgling town has no exports 
or attractions to speak of yet, 
<PAGE>
but the beds at the inn there 
are rumored to be among the 
softest found anywhere.

Brave Vesperia is hoping to gather 
their strength there before 
departing for the confrontation 
now looming before them.
