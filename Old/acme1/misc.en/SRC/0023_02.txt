Return of the Dragon Rider

## POINTER 83
The dragon rider staged an attack 
on Heliord last evening.

The assailant is thought to be the 
one behind the chain of destroyed 
blastia throughout the land.

<PAGE>
The dragon rider also attacked 
the room Rita was resting in, 
but Yuri took up his sword 
and fought the invader off.

Estellise threw herself in front 
of Rita in the commotion, and the 
mage was stunned by her kindness.

## POINTER 84
A Task Assigned

## POINTER 85
After her success in diffusing the 
blastia, Rita was recruited by the 
Knights to investigate the Keiv 
Moc Woods to the west of Heliord. 
Princess Estellise, who had planned 
to return to the capital, has 
decided to extend her stay with 
the group a while longer.

<PAGE>
The party also plans to stop 
by the guild city of Dahngrest 
on their way to the forest, in 
hopes of gathering information 
about the Blood Alliance.

## POINTER 86
Stronghold of the Guilds

## POINTER 87
Earlier this morning, the party arrived 
at Dahngrest, the center of guild 
culture. They are thought to be 
seeking an audience with the head 
of the guild Union, Don Whitehorse, 
to discuss Barbos's role in 
stealing the blastia cores.

<PAGE>
Begun as a means of mediating 
disputes between guilds, the 
Union sits in the center of 
Dahngrest and handles guild-related 
matters of all kinds.

## POINTER 88
For Our Beloved Town!

## POINTER 89
Monsters poured into Dahngrest today 
when the city's barrier failed suddenly. 
Along with help from Yuri and 
Flynn, the Union succeeded in repelling 
the attack. Deciding to eradicate 
the monsters in their lair, 
Don Whitehorse led a raiding 
party out of the city.

<PAGE>
Their meeting with the Don thus postponed, 
the party has set out with Rita 
for Keiv Moc, to guard the mage 
during her investigations there.

## POINTER 90
The Emerald Forest

## POINTER 91
High humidity, overgrown plants 
and trees, and a particularly vicious 
breed of monsters. Upon setting 
foot in Keiv Moc, visitors are 
bombarded with an unsettling 
array of sights and sounds.

<PAGE>
What causes these abnormalities? 
Hoping to uncover some answers to 
this question, Rita has plunged 
into the depths of the forest. The 
party encountered Raven on their 
way in, and he has joined their 
cause for the time being. With memories 
of their meeting in Nor still 
fresh, the group does not appear 
overjoyed by his presence.

## POINTER 92
The Silent Aer

## POINTER 93
Since entering Keiv Moc, Rita 
has proposed that the large quantities 
of aer being produced there are to blame
for the forest's overgrown condition.

A solitary figure appeared and put a stop
to the overflow of aer, but the party has
no clues to his identity, as he departed 
shortly thereafter.

<PAGE>
With the decreased aer, the threat 
of monster attacks has also lessened, 
and the Don has returned 
once more to Dahngrest.

Yuri plans to revisit the 
city in hopes of meeting 
with the Union leader.

## POINTER 94
Letter from an Imperial Candidate

## POINTER 95
Lieutenant Flynn arrived at Union 
headquarters this morning to present 
the Don with a letter from Prince 
Ioder requesting cooperation 
in dealing with Barbos.

The letter, however, instead detailed 
a plan to pardon Barbos's heinous 
crimes in exchange for the life of 
Don Whitehorse.
<PAGE>
Taking this affront as a declaration of war,
the Don roused the guilds to action,
and Dahngrest now teeters on the brink of all 
out battle with the Knights.

Flynn is thought to have been taken 
to prison for delivering the message, 
and many fear for his safety.

## POINTER 96
The Ties That Bind

## POINTER 97
Flynn, the knight who delivered 
a threatening letter to the Union, 
appears to have been freed 
from prison, with Yuri going 
behind bars in his place.

<PAGE>
Yuri was willing to make this sacrifice 
on account of their long-standing 
friendship. Moved by this show 
of compassion, the Don set Yuri 
free as well, and is said to 
have entrusted the youth with 
calming tensions between 
the Union and the Knights.

## POINTER 98
Hounding the Mastermind

## POINTER 99
A clash between the Union and the 
Knights was narrowly avoided today 
when Flynn arrived with an authentic 
letter from Prince Ioder.

The problems began when the first 
letter, a fake, was put in the Don's 
hands. Having traced the deception 
back to Barbos, Yuri has followed 
the leader of the Blood Alliance 
<PAGE>
to Ghasfarost Tower, the guild's 
base of operations. Witnesses say 
Yuri was seen heading for the tower 
with none other than the blastia-destroying 
dragon rider.

## POINTER 100
Tower in a Tempest

## POINTER 101
Estellise and the rest of the 
party made their way to Ghasfarost 
today and succeeded in meeting 
up with Yuri, who had 
arrived there earlier.

Yuri was joined by a Miss Judith, 
a female Krityan. The two had 
collaborated earlier to break 
free from the tower's jail.

<PAGE>
Believing Barbos and the lower quarter's 
aque blastia core to be waiting 
at Ghasfarost's summit, Yuri and 
his companions have begun the 
climb toward confrontation.

## POINTER 102
Storm's End

## POINTER 103
Yuri's party clashed with Barbos 
atop Ghasfarost Tower today in 
a bitter struggle that ended 
in defeat for the guild boss.

Barbos is thought to have perished 
after hurlling himself from the tower's 
heights following the battle.

<PAGE>
Having found the lower quarter's 
blastia core, Yuri's journey would 
appear to have come to a close.

The party has agreed to return 
to Dahngrest for the time being.

## POINTER 104
The Guilty Be Punished

## POINTER 105
The Knights have made clear Barbos's 
involvement in the theft of the blastia 
cores, as well as his attempts to 
incite a war between the Union and 
the empire. Magistrate Ragou has also 
been taken into custody. Lieutenant 
Flynn is slated to be decorated 
by the Knights for his pivotal 
role in diffusing the conflict.

<PAGE>
Ragou will be transferred to the 
capital tomorrow. With crowds expected 
to line the streets in hopes of 
witnessing Nor's fallen tyrant, 
the Knights and the Union will 
be keeping strict watch to prevent 
the criminal from becoming 
a victim of vengeance.

## POINTER 106
Death to the Guilty

## POINTER 107
In a proclamation today, the imperial 
Council announced that Ragou 
has been absolved of his crimes 
against the public good by way 
of insufficient evidence.

The magistrate's sudden disappearance 
following this pardon has raised fears 
that he may become a target of retribution 
for those who suffered under the 
<PAGE>
yoke of his authority. There are 
even whispers that Ragou has already 
been killed, and the Knights 
are searching feverishly for 
any sign of his whereabouts.

In other news, Flynn's promotion 
to Captain was made public today.

## POINTER 108
Trouble Breeds Still More Trouble

## POINTER 109
Dahngrest was attacked today by 
a massive bird monster. Princess 
Estellise found herself in its 
sights just before her departure 
for the capital, but was fortunately 
saved from harm by Yuri.

The monster was driven off by a secret 
weapon wielded by the Knights. Some 
say that it spoke in a human tongue 
<PAGE>
and had come specifically to do 
away with the Princess, but these 
rumors are as yet unconfirmed.

Estellise seems to have altered 
her previous plans, and has left 
the town with her companions 
in the direction of Heliord.

## POINTER 110
A New Guild is Born!

## POINTER 111
This morning, Karol Capel 
proclaimed the formation of 
the guild Brave Vesperia.

Though a mere 12 years old, Karol 
has been in and out of numerous guilds 
and accumulated a wealth of experience 
rare for a boy his age.

<PAGE>
The guild is guarding Princess Estellise 
in her search for the speaking 
monster, and is currently headed 
for the Sands of Kogorh.

The guild plans to reach 
Torim by way of Heliord, and 
then to charter a ship.

## POINTER 112
A Town Without Direction

## POINTER 113
Heliord's citizens have begun to 
disappear in what is becoming an 
alarming trend. Some say that 
harsh labor practices in the town 
are to blame, but such an explanation 
seems insufficient given the 
large numbers of people that 
have now gone missing.

<PAGE>
A man named Teagle, who moved here 
from Nor recently, is one such 
example. The man's wife, Kelas, 
has asked Brave Vesperia to search 
for her husband. Determined to 
get their man, the party hatches 
a racy plan of seduction to 
distract the city's guards.

## POINTER 114
How to Make a Gorgeous Gown

## POINTER 115
Today we will be explaining 
the method for putting together 
a truly stunning dress.

While the nobles of the capital can 
order their gowns from the trendiest 
fashion boutiques, such luxuries 
are not available to those living 
in frontier towns. In a pinch though,
<PAGE>
a plumed tail, some sparrow's 
down, and a basilisk scale can 
be combined to turn out a dress 
of the highest caliber!

If, like Brave Vesperia, your plans 
call for a little risky business, 
don't miss this chance to make a dress 
that'll knock their socks off.

## POINTER 116
The Boomtown's Secrets

## POINTER 117
Having rescued her from confinement 
in the Knights' guard house, 
the party learned from Rita of 
the widespread forced labor 
being conducted in Heliord.

Believing this discovery to be 
a lead to Teagle's disappearance, 
Brave Vesperia set about investigating 
the labor camp.

<PAGE>
Having witnessed the transport 
of some suspicious blastia, 
Rita is strongly urging the 
party to uncover the true nature 
of the camp's operations.

## POINTER 118
Freeing the Oppressed

## POINTER 119
Responding to rumors of slave labor 
in Heliord, Captain Flynn has 
conducted a raid on the labor 
camp and set the workers free.

It would seem that Captain Cumore 
of the Knights, who had organized 
the labor camp, had also relieved 
the interim magistrate in Heliord 
of his duties. The Captain is also 
<PAGE>
suspected to have been using the 
camp as a means of amassing 
a store of illegal weaponry.

Brave Vesperia appears to have 
given chase when the renegade 
Captain made his escape.
