Guess the sum of the 3 dice rolled by the Dice Master.
The sum is considered ”low” if it's a number that
falls between 3 and 10. It is considered ”high” if it
falls between 11-18. The player makes a guess
on whether the sum will be a ”high” or a ”low”number.
Get three guesses correct in a row to win.
It's game over if you miss even one!

## POINTER 126
Guess if the sum of 2 dice is an odd or even number.

It is ”odd” if it is a 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11. Get 3 guesses
in a row correct to win. It’s game over if you miss even one!
