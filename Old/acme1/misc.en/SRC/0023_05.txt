## POINTER 198
Sanctum of the Sublime

## POINTER 199
Brave Vesperia entered the Shrine 
of Baction today, close 
behind Commandant Alexei.

They have made Princess Estellise's 
safe return their foremost goal, 
but were also drawn by their contempt 
for Alexei's barbaric acts.

<PAGE>
The temple proper is divided into 
a perplexing series of catacombs, 
but relying on their map, the 
guild progresses ever closer 
to the shrine's innermost reaches 
and the waiting Princess.

## POINTER 200
Death of a Captain

## POINTER 201
A tremor struck the Shrine of 
Baction today, collapsing its 
inner sanctum, and Captain Schwann 
of the Imperial Knights lost 
his life in the tumult.

Captain Schwann, who was assumed to 
be the alter ego of Raven, perished 
in the process of enabling Brave 
Vesperia to escape, and the guild 
<PAGE>
left the premises, crestfallen at 
the loss of their former ally.

Prior to this tragedy, Alexei left 
the shrine with Princess Estellise 
in tow, using the Captain as 
a shield to make his escape.

## POINTER 202
Alexei Returns to Heracles

## POINTER 203
The mobile fortress Heracles 
was seen to be on the move 
toward the Ilyccian continent 
late this afternoon.

Brave Vesperia gave pursuit with 
the knowledge that Alexei and Estellise 
boarded the fortress following 
their departure from Baction.

<PAGE>
Meanwhile, Captain Flynn and 
his brigade have assembled a 
fleet and taken up the chase 
by sea, hoping to bring the renegade 
Commandant to justice.

## POINTER 204
Search for the Engine Room

## POINTER 205
Brave Vesperia succeeded in boarding 
the mobile fortress today, but found 
no sign of the Princess there.

The guild was startled when Zagi 
reappeared suddenly and smashed 
Heracles's control panel, rendering 
the fortress inoperable.

<PAGE>
Deciding that attacking the engine 
room would be the surest means of 
stopping the runaway vehicle, the 
party has moved their search to the 
inner workings of the fortress.

## POINTER 206
Stopping a Juggernaut

## POINTER 207
The apatheia that served as the source 
of power to Heracles was destroyed 
today by Brave Vesperia. The engines 
powering the fortress ceased to 
function, and the capital, previously 
in the path of the juggernaut, 
was saved as a result.

<PAGE>
Based on a tip from Yeager that Alexei 
has made his way to the capital, 
the guild is considering the best 
strategy for entering the city.

## POINTER 208
Return of the Commandant

## POINTER 209
The traitor Alexei made his return 
to the imperial capital before noon 
today. The city's defenses proved 
no match for the fallen Commandant, 
who was accompanied by his private 
force, the Royal Guard.

It is unclear what fate Alexei has 
in store for the Princess, and many 
are concerned for the safety of 
<PAGE>
the city's residents as well.

Brave Vesperia have hardened their 
resolve and are preparing to 
follow Alexei into the capital 
by approaching from the sky.

## POINTER 210
The Capital Enveloped in Aer

## POINTER 211
A dark cloud appeared suddenly 
above the capital today, knocking 
a dragon from the sky that 
flew too near to it.

In actuality, the dragon, Ba'ul, 
carrying Brave Vesperia in the Fiertia, 
was struck down by Alexei's formula 
that uses Estellise's tremendous 
power against her will.

<PAGE>
As luck would have it, the ship came 
through the crash unscathed, but its 
passengers were not so fortunate. 
Forced to put Estellise's rescue on 
hold, the guild has dragged itself 
to nearby Nor in search of treatment 
for its wounded members.

## POINTER 212
A Northern Detour to the Capital

## POINTER 213
Struck by the mobile fortress's 
recent cannon fire, the roads leading 
to inner Ilyccia from its seashore 
have become impassable.

This has hampered Brave Vesperia's 
return to the capital, but the 
guild plans to try their luck 
in crossing the Zopheir Rift, 
a region of the continent's 
<PAGE>
northern sea, which is frozen 
solid at this time of year.

Access to the Rift can only be 
gained by traveling north along 
a narrow strip of land pinched 
between Ehmead Hill and the sea.

## POINTER 214
Sea of Ice

## POINTER 215
Their sights set on returning 
to the empire, Brave Vesperia 
took their first steps into 
the Zopheir Rift today.

The guild has spotted a massive creature 
that seems to be hounding them from 
beneath the ice, and are keeping 
themselves on constant alert.

<PAGE>
Having prepared to rescue Estellise, 
no matter what the cost, the 
party will not falter until 
their goal is achieved.

## POINTER 216
Menace Beneath the Ice

## POINTER 217
Today, Brave Vesperia narrowly defeated 
the monster that dwells in the sea 
beneath the ice of Zopheir Rift. 
The creature made skillful use of 
the aer flow to hunt its prey.

Karol displayed remarkable tenacity 
in the battle, defending his companions 
who had been pinned down by the monster,
earning their admiration in the process.

<PAGE>
The effort took every ounce 
of Karol's strength.

Though it means further delaying 
Estellise's rescue, the party 
appears to be stopped at Halure, 
giving the courageous lad 
some richly deserved rest.

## POINTER 218
Compassion for the Imperials

## POINTER 219
Their town affected by the disturbances 
in the capital, Halure's elders 
opened a council to determine 
the stance the town will take 
in the trying times ahead.

The meeting stretched over five hours, 
but the group adjourned with the following 
resolution: "All refugees from the 
<PAGE>
capital are to be received with kindness. 
We will not yield to the terrorism 
of the traitors." Hoping to keep 
abreast of the changes in these 
uncertain times, Halure is said 
to be arranging an information 
exchange with the capital.

## POINTER 220
A Noble Calling

## POINTER 221
On the authority of Prince Ioder, 
the inn at Halure is currently offering 
up its rooms and services free of 
charge. These measures were taken 
to accommodate the refugees arriving 
daily from the capital.

According to the Prince, a refugee 
himself, aer is running rampant 
<PAGE>
on the streets of the city, 
making it uninhabitable.

Having heard this news, Brave 
Vesperia retired to Halure's 
inn to discuss its affect 
on their rescue mission.

## POINTER 222
Going it Alone

## POINTER 223
Yuri left Halure this evening 
headed for the capital, determined 
to rescue Princess Estellise 
single-handedly.

The young man's solitary action 
would seem to have resulted from 
some decision reached among the 
members of Brave Vesperia.

<PAGE>
The Knights are amassing a force 
at Deidon Hold for the purpose of 
retaking the capital, and regular 
passage through the fort is currently 
being severely restricted.

## POINTER 224
The Lost Capital

## POINTER 225
Yuri was reunited with the other 
members of Brave Vesperia when 
they managed to catch up 
with him this afternoon.

The experience strengthened the bonds 
of friendship in the guild, and 
is expected to have a lasting effect 
on their future endeavors.

<PAGE>
With entry to the lower quarter 
barred by wildly overgrown vines, 
Brave Vesperia is planning 
to gain access to the capital 
via the citizens' quarter.

## POINTER 226
Storm-Wracked City

## POINTER 227
Brave Vesperia successfully entered 
the capital this afternoon. Faced 
with the highly concentrated 
aer plaguing the city, the guild 
will be making for Zaphias Castle, 
where they hope to find 
the Princess and Alexei.

<PAGE>
Yuri appears preoccupied with thoughts 
of his hometown, sealed off as it 
is by a barricade of plant life. 
His companions believe his concern 
to stem from stories they have heard 
of lower quarter residents who 
failed to escape the capital.

## POINTER 228
Familiar Faces

## POINTER 229
Following their successful infiltration 
of Zaphias Castle, Brave Vesperia 
discovered the lower quarter's 
residents holed up in the castle 
dining hall. The relocation was 
accomplished by Lieutenant Leblanc 
and two of his knights.

Though glad to be reunited 
with his community, Yuri returned 
<PAGE>
at once to the matter 
of Estellise's rescue.

Meanwhile, Alexei appears to 
be using Estellise's power from 
within the capital's barrier 
blastia, the Sword Steps.

## POINTER 230
Stair's End

## POINTER 231
In a move that has fanned the 
flames of his rebellion, Alexei 
raised the ancient ruins of 
Zaude from the seas to the west 
of the capital, and then fled 
into the temple's halls.

After their battle with Alexei, Brave 
Vesperia heeded the advice of Captain 
Flynn and is gathering their 
<PAGE>
strength at Zaphias Castle.

Princess Estellise was freed from 
her captor unharmed, but the guild 
must press on to stop Alexei, 
who now threatens to plunge the 
world forever into darkness.

## POINTER 232
Crushed Ambitions

## POINTER 233
Brave Vesperia departed from Zaphias 
Castle this morning in pursuit 
of the traitor, Alexei.

Captain Flynn also appears to have 
set forth from the capital, though 
slightly later than the guild.

<PAGE>
Their minds set to the task before 
them, both groups have hastened after 
Alexei to the fortress shrine of 
Zaude, which has surfaced off 
of Tolbyccia's southern shores.

## POINTER 234
Into the Fortress Shrine

## POINTER 235
Brave Vesperia infiltrated the fortress 
shrine of Zaude this morning.

The group made their entry via a 
ventilation shaft in the massive 
structure after Phaeroh staged 
a sudden attack, drawing the attention 
of Alexei's Royal Guard.

<PAGE>
It is thought that the insides 
of the fortress are littered 
with traps to stop intruders, 
and we expect reports of even 
greater heroism as Brave Vesperia 
rises to the challenge.

## POINTER 236
Overcoming Obstacles

## POINTER 237
Yeager, the boss of the guild Leviathan's 
Claw, perished today in the 
depths of Zaude shrine.

<PAGE>
Alexei had sent Yeager to dispatch 
a group of intruders that 
had managed to break through 
the shrine's defenses.

<PAGE>
The guild boss fell at the hands 
of Brave Vesperia. His faithful 
assistants Gauche and Droite 
did not take part in the battle, 
choosing instead to watch it 
play out from a distance.

<PAGE>
With their goal of defeating Alexei 
remaining, Brave Vesperia have 
continued their journey through 
the halls of the shrine.
