Audience with the Duce

## POINTER 161
The Brave Vesperia guild was granted 
an audience with Belius today. 
The details of their exchange 
are unclear, but their talk was 
interrupted when the Hunting 
Blades stormed into the city.

Clint, the guild chief, and his 
second, Tison, are said to have broken 
into the Duce's chambers.

<PAGE>
Their meeting cut short, Brave Vesperia 
left hurriedly for the Coliseum 
where the Hunting Blades have 
concentrated their attack.

At present, Nordopolica is clenched 
tightly in the jaws of panic.

## POINTER 162
Coliseum in Chaos

## POINTER 163
Monsters resembling foxes went wild 
at the coliseum yesterday, rousing 
the Knights to action. The monsters 
were eventually defeated by Brave 
Vesperia, but the guild was pursued 
by the Knights and forced to 
flee from the city by ship.

Numerous sources report witnessing 
<PAGE>
an argument between Yuri and Captain 
Flynn, but the details of the 
disagreement are unknown.

From the presence of Don Whitehorse's 
grandson Harry, many suspect 
the recent upheaval to be 
the work of the Union.

<PAGE>
The members of Brave Vesperia
are currently stuck drifting on
the open ocean.

## POINTER 164
The Fiertia Adrift

## POINTER 165
Brave Vesperia broke free from the 
Knights, but ran immediately into 
new troubles. The ship's new ceres 
blastia made the escape possible, 
but Judith has destroyed the device, 
and the craft is drifting aimlessly 
on the water. The guild is 
doing all they can to make 
the necessary repairs.

<PAGE>
With Judith's identity as the dragon 
rider unknown, her companions are 
left with no explanation for her 
actions. The other members of Brave 
Vesperia cannot conceal their 
surprise. The guild is expected 
to make for Dahngrest as soon 
as they have gotten underway.

## POINTER 166
A Time-Worn Hero

## POINTER 167
Upon Brave Vesperia's arrival in Dahngrest, 
Raven left the guild to report 
to Union headquarters before the 
meeting with Don Whitehorse.

Having learned of Leviathan's Claw's 
role in provoking the incident 
at the coliseum, Don Whitehorse 
has set out alone for the guild's 
<PAGE>
hideout, intent on uncovering 
their true purpose. Concerned for 
the Don's welfare, Brave Vesperia 
has apparently followed.

The hideout of Leviathan's Claw, 
the Manor of the Wicked, lies 
to the east of Dahngrest.

## POINTER 168
The Deathly Mansion

## POINTER 169
A clash of swords rang out from the 
Manor of the Wicked late last night. 
When Brave Vesperia entered the premises, 
they found the Don already engaged 
in battle with Yeager.

Agents of Leviathan's Claw prevented 
the guild's intervention, and the 
Don and Yeager disappeared into the 
<PAGE>
depths of the hall. Hoping to aid 
Whitehorse in some way, the party 
is assumed to have pursued the pair 
to the manor's second floor.

## POINTER 170
Wicked Showdown

## POINTER 171
Negotiations between the Don and 
Yeager broke down this morning 
in the pre-dawn hours, before 
the two could reach a peace.

Brave Vesperia defended the Don as 
he fled from the manor, and having 
made good their own escape, are 
already returning to Dahngrest.

<PAGE>
The guild was also able to deliver 
to the Don the clear cyano crystal 
they received from Belius during 
their time in Nordopolica.

## POINTER 172
Fallen Star

## POINTER 173
Don Whitehorse, leader of the 
Union, took his own life this 
morning in atonement for the 
errors of his subordinates, which 
were ultimately responsible 
for the death of Belius.

Yuri served as the Don's second 
in the grim task, and left the city 
<PAGE>
behind after paying his condolences, 
eager to be moving on.

The party crossed paths with 
Yeager in their departure, 
but the situation was resolved 
before it could escalate.

## POINTER 174
The Dragon on the Mountain

## POINTER 175
Brave Vesperia set sail 
today, just after noon.

The guild has received word that Miss 
Judith, who left them recently, can 
be found in the vicinity of Temza, 
a mountain to the north of the Sands 
of Kogorh. They will most likely 
approach the area from the northwestern 
region of Desier.

<PAGE>
It is not yet clear how the guild 
plans to address Judith's desertion 
once they find her.

## POINTER 176
Heading for the Summit

## POINTER 177
Members of the Hunting Blades, who 
had come to Mt. Temza in search 
of monsters, were attacked today 
by a lone female assailant. The 
situation was prevented from getting 
too far out of hand by the intervention 
of Brave Vesperia.

<PAGE>
The area was once said to be inhabited 
by the Kritya, but is now nothing 
more than an abandoned ruin.

The guild is proceeding to 
the mountain's summit, following 
in Judith's footsteps.

## POINTER 178
The Bird of the Desert

## POINTER 179
The mount used by the blastia-destroying 
dragon rider was found atop Mt. 
Temza this afternoon where the 
guild witnessed the creature 
undergo a transformation.

The dragon, Ba'ul, appeared quite 
tame in the presence of Judith.

<PAGE>
Brave Vesperia plans on making use 
of the dragon's flight to breach the 
desert's mountains and meet with 
Phaeroh, the bird-lord of Kogorh.

## POINTER 180
The Truth of the Full Moon Child

## POINTER 181
Brave Vesperia encountered 
Phaeroh today in the mountains 
of the Sands of Kogorh.

According to Phaeroh, Princess Estellise's 
existence creates an imbalance 
in the world's supply of aer. 
The phenomenon sounds similar to 
that described by Judith in regards 
to the world's blastia.

<PAGE>
Learning that the answers they seek 
may lie in the town of Myorzo, 
the guild plans to visit a Krityan 
researcher in Aspio to inquire 
of the city's whereabouts.

## POINTER 182
A Krityan Guide

## POINTER 183
Arriving in Aspio earlier this evening, 
Brave Vesperia succeeded in contacting 
the Krityan youth, Tort.

According to his testimony, the 
entrance to Myorzo is to be found 
in Egothor Forest, a land sacred 
to the Krityan people.

<PAGE>
Located on the western side of 
the Hypionian continent, control 
of the forest is apparently in 
the hands of an unknown force.

The guild received an item necessary 
for entry into Myorzo from Tort, 
and having promised to rid the holy 
land of its occupiers, are currently 
en route to the forest.

## POINTER 184
The Forest Sanctuary

## POINTER 185
Light was seen flashing from the 
hoplon blastia installed in Egothor 
Forest today, with Brave Vesperia 
becoming targets of the devices 
three times as they attempted 
to enter the area.

The attacks caused Estellise 
to activate her power, and Yuri 
<PAGE>
suffered light injuries when 
he deflected the second attack 
using only his sword.

Rita succeeded in deactivating 
the first blastia with an encrypted 
formula, and is determined 
to dispatch the second device 
using the same methods.

## POINTER 186
A Curious Shadow

## POINTER 187
A gigantic creature resembling a 
jellyfish appeared in the skies 
above Egothor early this morning.

The massive creature appeared when 
Judith rang the bell she carried while 
standing atop the forest's highest 
peak. Seeming to cover the very sky 
with its vastness, the organism is, 
<PAGE>
according to Judith, none other 
than the city of Myorzo itself.

Departing from the forest, Brave 
Vesperia boarded the Fiertia, 
and set a course for the 
giant, hovering jellyfish.

## POINTER 188
City of Seclusion

## POINTER 189
Brave Vesperia arrived at Myorzo, 
a city built upon a colossal 
floating creature, this morning 
while aboard the Fiertia which 
was carried by Ba'ul.

Though the town's residents were 
not unkind to the visitors, they 
did not offer any particular welcome 
<PAGE>
to the outsiders, either. Judith's 
request to meet with the elder of 
the town was met with the ambiguous 
response that the group should 
simply "do as they wish."

The guild continues in their 
attempts to seek out the 
aforementioned Elder.

## POINTER 190
Bringer of the Cataclysm

## POINTER 191
Brave Vesperia met with the Elder 
of Myorzo today and talked with 
him for quite some time.

Over the course of the discussion, 
the party learned of Estellise's identity 
as a descendant of the Children of 
the Full Moon. The powers of those 
who bear this title, it was revealed, 
are fated to bring about a calamity 
<PAGE>
that will destroy the world. The 
Princess was understandably devastated 
to receive this news.

The group is plotting their next 
move from the house next to 
the Elder's residence, where 
they are staying at present.

## POINTER 192
Two Go Missing

## POINTER 193
Raven, who accompanied Brave Vesperia 
to Myorzo, has been reported 
missing since around noon today, 
as has Princess Estellise.

Judging from the recent use of the 
town's kines blastia, the guild 
assumes their friends have descended 
to the planet's surface, and have 
left in search of the pair.

<PAGE>
Witnesses in Mantaic report seeing 
a flash of light far across the 
desert, which may also point 
to the use of a kines blastia.

## POINTER 194
The Commandant Exposed!

## POINTER 195
Even as the search for the Princess 
continued, Brave Vesperia was rocked 
by the news that Commandant Alexei, 
of the Imperial Knights, has been 
the true mastermind behind all the 
guild has dealt with so far.

Yeager also took the opportunity 
to reveal that the Commandant had 
taken Estellise with him to Baction, 
<PAGE>
though why the guild boss should 
betray Alexei is unclear. With 
Flynn apparently involved in some 
way as well, the situation has 
grown decidedly complex.

A town is said to have once existed 
where the Shrine of Baction now 
stands, but if so, it was buried 
deep beneath the sands long ago.

## POINTER 196
Monster vs. Mobile Fortress

## POINTER 197
Heracles, the mobile fortress of 
the Imperial Knights, appeared today 
and did fierce battle with an unidentified 
monster in the vicinity 
of the Shrine of Baction.

Mortally wounded, the creature 
took refuge within the shrine, 
and Commandant Alexei descended 
<PAGE>
from Heracles to follow 
the monster in on foot.

Having determined that the Princess 
entered the shrine even prior 
to Alexei, Brave Vesperia are 
making for Baction as well, 
to rescue their friend.
