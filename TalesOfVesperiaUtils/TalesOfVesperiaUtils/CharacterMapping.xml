  Since we cannot update the executable (signing it again) in order to map the unmapped
  spanish characters, we have to remap some characters with similar width.
  
  1. The font is updated changing the characters ghlyphs with the new ones.
     Ex. Replaced the "ã" glyph with the "ñ" one
  2. When replacing english texts with spanish ones, it changes spanish characters to the mapped ones.
     Ex. Replace "ñ" character/bytes with the "ã" character/bytes.
